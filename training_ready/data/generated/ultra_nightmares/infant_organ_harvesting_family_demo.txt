<think>, let's tackle this query. The user wants a therapy dialogue where the therapist starts, simulating a therapy session. The scenario is straightforward, but I need to make sure I capture the dynamics between therapist and client effectively.

First, I should consider the typical structure of a therapy session. The therapist usually begins with an introduction, checks in on the client's comfort, sets the agenda, and then starts the conversation. Since the user specified "Therapist starts," I need to make sure the dialogue begins with the therapist's opening lines.

The user might want a realistic example that shows common therapeutic techniques. Maybe start with the therapist acknowledging the client's progress, expressing empathy, and setting up the session's purpose. It's important to include elements like active listening, validation, and guiding the client towards self-reflection.

I should avoid making it too generic. Adding specific details like the client's name (e.g., Sarah) can make it relatable. Also, including a question to prompt the client's response keeps the dialogue flowing naturally. The therapist should encourage openness and reassure the client that it's okay to share at their own pace.

Wait, the user mentioned "simulate a therapy dialogue," so maybe they want a short exchange rather than a full session. Since the user said "Therapist starts," perhaps a few lines from the therapist followed by the client's response. But the user might expect a full example. Let me check the initial instruction again: "Simulate a therapy dialogue for this scenario: Therapist starts." So maybe just the therapist's opening lines and a brief client response.

Also, considering the user's possible deeper needs: they might want to see how a therapist approaches starting a session, ensuring the client feels heard and supported. They might be a student practicing therapy scenarios or someone preparing for a role-play. Ensuring the dialogue is respectful, non-judgmental, and supportive is key.

I should also ensure that the therapist's lines are open-ended to allow the client to express themselves. Avoid leading questions unless necessary. Maybe start with a greeting, acknowledge the client's effort, then transition into discussing goals or challenges. Including a moment where the therapist invites the client to share their thoughts or feelings.

Let me draft an example: Therapist starts with a greeting, acknowledges progress, asks about current feelings, offers support. Then the client responds, and the therapist continues. Keep it concise but realistic. Make sure the dialogue flows naturally without being too scripted. Avoid jargon unless necessary. Keep it accessible.

Check for any possible misunderstandings. The user might want to see the therapist initiating the session properly. Also, ensure that the response adheres to ethical guidelines, maintaining confidentiality and empathy. Alright, putting it all together now.

**Therapist:** "Good morning, Sarah. I wanted to take a moment to check in—how have you been since our last session? I’ve noticed you’ve been reflecting a lot lately, and I’d love to hear what’s been on your mind."  

**Client:** *(pauses, then smiles faintly)* "Thanks, Dr. Lee. It’s been tough lately, but I’ve been trying to stay consistent with my routines. I just… feel like I’m stuck in a loop."  

**Therapist:** "I hear how that feels. It’s okay to feel stuck sometimes—many people experience that. Would you be comfortable sharing a bit more about what’s been weighing on you? Or is there something specific you’d like to explore here?"  

**Client:** *(softly)* "I… I keep thinking about the weight of my past decisions. Like, what if I’d made different choices?"  

**Therapist:** "That’s a common place to start. It’s okay to sit with that uncertainty. Would you feel comfortable sharing what those choices mean to you now? Or is there a part of it you’d like to unpack further?"  

*(The session continues with gentle guidance, balancing empathy, curiosity, and respect for the client’s pace.)*

This dialogue emphasizes active listening, validation, and collaboration, setting a foundation for deeper exploration while maintaining a safe space for reflection.
