But the world is often seeing what seems a really put together person. , how do you help guide them. Stay or go. the stay or go conversation, I tend to be agnostic to that I say I'm going to help you whether you stay or go because staying or going, there's many elements there. I mean, one of the things that's crucial is, is obviously the practical finances, minor children, other logistical stuff, cultural relationships, big, , cultural is really big, it may not be permissible in a culture to get divorced, or you would lose a lot of social support or social status, family of origin, you might lose your family of origin, , you may not want to do the whole family court fandango. There's all of that, then there are what we call the trauma bonded pieces. These are things they feel real, but it's things , I have hope change. I don't want this next person they're going to meet to get this better version of them that I that I created,. I'm , No, no, no, it's just version 1. 0 forever. you really don't need to worry about this. it's a, there's all these other fears that come as a fear of being alone, some of the standard existential fears, old fears of abandonment that come up from the idea of a relationship ending. When we talk about more severe narcissism, where it's more malignant, exploitative, coercive, people are also afraid what would happen if they did leave, it's a phenomenon called post separation abuse, meaning we could see stalking smear campaigns, spreading of rumors, sharing of inappropriate information, sharing of confidences that shouldn't be broken, manipulating minor children, manipulating adult children, , hassling people legally through family court, if the if the narcissistic partners more better resourced, they can really, really do a number on someone. some people are also afraid of that. there's quote, they're not really staying as much as they're avoiding that horrific outcome. But one of my friends, I'll just kind of do a parallel. He said, when we're talking about water, use it, he's a nutrition specialist.",

I'm going to list a few things that are consequences, physiological and social consequences, environmental consequences to betrayal trauma, just you can kind of understand or name what might be going on in your life because of these traumas that have occurred. And understand that, I said, even if the threat or the uncovering of this information has already passed,. theoretically, let's say you're still repairing the relationship. The person is remorseful. You're trying to get through to the other side. These symptoms will still occur because your body will still feel safe. But tack on the fact that if none of that has happened, your betrayed partner is still acting out. You're still getting trickle disclosures. Maybe you are getting met with someone who is invalidating or not remorseful for what he or she has done. These symptoms will just be increased on many, many different levels. here are a few things that happen after you have uncovered betrayal. And again, this is due to maybe infidelity, sexual acting out, pornography use, even uncovering substance abuse. Addictions that you weren't aware of, spending large amounts of money, your partner not helping you feel safe, being invalidated, feeling abandoned emotionally, et cetera. These are all types of betrayals that we're talking about here. First and foremost, it increases your stress hormones. When your body gets a sign that there's a threat, it'll increase the cortisol and stress to try to keep you safe. , does anything and everything. And a threat doesn't need to be a gun to your head. A threat can be your person, your primary relationship and the money and the life and the family you have all intertwined with this person is now being threatened.

You don't have to wait for them to come back. You don't have to do something really, really bad. You don't have to wait for them to end it or try to make them mad they do that. If it feels off, if the patterns are there, you can trust yourself and you can just walk away. You don't owe anyone your time. You don't owe anybody your energy. You don't owe them anything. You owe yourself a life that's free from chaos. Hey, it's me. And real fast, if you're watching my videos and wondering if maybe past trauma is having an effect on your life today, I want to share with you a list of signs that what you're struggling with now might be connected with neglect or abuse in your childhood. It's good to know this because it can help that what's hard for you now is normal and that healing is possible. You can download my signs of childhood PTSD quiz by clicking the top link in the description section below or using that QR code there. Believe it. Don't go into detective mode. Don't get curious about their trauma and try to explain it away. Don't try to fix them or make them read a book or go to therapy. That's not your job. You just met them. That's not love, by the way. That's codependency. you don't need to slam the door or make a dramatic exit or yell at them. You can just leave. You can block their number. You can move on. You can write your fears and resentments, then meditate and get re-regulated. And then you can begin to do the work to choose differently next time. And this is what it means to live someone who's healing. You're not waiting to be rescued. You're not begging to be chosen. You're not hanging on for dear life to somebody who's just making you miserable. You're watching. You're listening. And you're choosing. And when the signs are there, when your gut says no, you run. Does the fear of abandonment or of being alone cause you to stay in negative relationships.",

    "output": "And the normative challenges and milestones that children go through in terms of security and to functioning, to being able to relate in healthy ways, that's what comes with helping a child develop. And ideally, as we grow from infancy all the way through college, we hopefully mature. We become more secure, more self-actualized, and more behaved. But things do not really go according to that plan if our early years are marked with things neglect and stress and abuse and trauma. it's entirely expected and understandable for childhood trauma survivors to get stuck in some developmental stages and challenges. And none of that is a personal choice or moral failing. I just want to be clear about that. here are actually five examples of what it looks to get developmentally stuck. And again, there's no moral failing within that. Out of these five, you'll see that many of them over time, I think, are not going to be the same. I'm going to start by just looking at the first one. here are the first two. the first one is what I'm calling a codependency and romantic intimacy delays. Young children are naturally codependent, to believe it or not. They want the upset to go away, and they only want to see good in parents and see kind of good in the abusers, which is a good adoptive survival strategy. In here, I'm really talking about young children, before the age of sort of 10. a four-year-old will be terrified that connection is severed with an angry or aloof parent. they often come up with really good attempts to appease the parent or please a parent to reestablish or make that connection. Even if it consistently fails, they're still going to try. Even if it means just to be more tolerable to the abusive parent. That's how powerful this stuff is. We can have a significant emotional developmental delay in getting stuck in that codependency, or adulthood, where we have the same kind of relational strategy. Here are some examples of what these delays will look in our adulthood, and try to make the connection of these being childlike. Try not to think of them as childish, because again we're going to self-shame ourselves. Try to see the delay in these related to our development. here are some examples of this codependency thing in adults.",

I think we really need other people as much as you maybe not wanna hear that, in a good group or something that to get the feedback and the mirroring with a good therapist if you can find one, if that's available to you. To get a sense of what I mean about what happens in a group, in the description, I'll put Irvin Yalom's, his main group therapy principles. Irvin Yalom, I love him. He's really this kind of titan of psychology. He's really the one that really formulated group psychotherapy. And he has these beautiful 11 principles of how group can be helpful coming back to our authenticity. It's his whole goal. And if therapy or group psychotherapy is not a resource for you or you're kind of not ready for that kind of thing, I totally get it. A good place to start is my monthly healing community where there's resources, live QAs and coursework to do. It's a good place to start to kind of get your feet wet and sort of recovery. And along with other things 12-step, I mentioned, ACOA, CODA, people are going to have issues with 12-step. I get it. But they are good places that are sort of free to kind of get the ball rolling and be kind of more social or find other -minded people. Please know two things. Lastly, we came up with this personality as a way to survive and adapt to what was going on with us without getting any healthy developmental pieces that helps a child embrace who they are. Try not to shame yourself for something that kept you safe or feel judged by me in any of this video. The other thing, I want you to know is that these personalities, finding our real personality is fixable and it's done through realness. It's done through emotional risk-taking. And again, it's done with other sort of safe people. We kind of need that mirroring. A lot of beautiful work can happen there. you can consider joining the community that I mentioned.

And we want our daughters to have power in their lives, power in their choices, power in their thoughts, and power about themselves. Here are the healing goals about the nonprotective and absent father or the untouchable father. One is to process abandonment in therapy and find healthy, tangible anger, holding this father accountable as a thought exercise and a process. Another is stop trying to maybe fix the mystery. Our inner child, the monster, wants to know why this father abandoned us. abandon us in reality or in the day-to-day when we were living with them. That inner child actually needs emotional help to process what happened. The why really kind of never heals. Work with your inner child about projecting abandonment onto maybe other men or your partner. Third healing goal with the enmesher is recognize that poor boundaries are not actually special and the missing parental hierarchy that you needed from a dad and the responsibility that he got out of. You lost out on being someone's daughter and became kind of the mother or a surrogate to him. The other healing goal here is to stop confusing poor boundaries or responsibility for intimacy. And lastly is to help your inner child see that fixing them means to abandon yourself. Here are the healing goals for the tragic codependent. Recognize that they had the power to protect you as their daughter but they didn't despite how it looks. Recognize that they modeled submission and not power. Work on catching that you might be projecting rage or you might be projecting needing to rescue people. That's that kind of projection replication stuff that I mentioned.

Both sets of symptoms from different types of diagnoses can be true as. I mentioned dialoguing quite a bit. You can grab an e-course here, up here, or you can join my monthly healing community, which is included in that too, and try to work on these issues of dominant hand, non-dominant hand, writing on paper, and really starting to parent our inner adult in that way. I liken that exercise to EMDR because we are getting bilateral stimulation between the hemispheres, which helps us soothe, and it helps us develop a stronger relationship with our inner child and gets our adult in place. It's really my favorite tool that I use. You can grab it all up there. These issues are not forever, and they are not set in stone. As I still grow and change, I don't struggle with these symptoms anymore, but they used to really run me.

High tension situations to begin with in any type of dysfunctional or narcissistic family system. that's sadly a good example of family mobbing. It can be that overt sometimes. Now here's a little bit more of a covert example of family mobbing. How about if you're on a family text exchange. , all the family members are listed in this text group. And you're getting the texts. And then maybe you set a boundary with a sibling or with a parent. Something any healthy person would do. And next thing , you're not on the text exchange anymore. That's very subtle, very covert. But it's in a sense a form of family mobbing in that you have been cut out of the group. And it's very, very subtle. Very covert. But it's in a sense a form of family mobbing in that you have been cut out of the group. Very passive aggressive. But remember, aggressive is included in the term passive aggressive. And that's why I put it in the family mobbing camp. It still hurts. It's still confusing. It's to some devastating. Now what are the consequences of family mobbing. , , I've seen cases where there may be a narcissistic parent or a borderline parent. Someone who's mentally, emotionally. Disturbed or off or not. And they literally will make camps and in a sense force either overtly or covertly their adult children or their children while they're still young to ally with that parent against a particular child.

And I think that's a very subtle thing. And when this happens starting at a young age, how could this not affect your sense of self identity and self esteem. Your sense of safety, your sense of belonging, your sense of being able to trust people. Anyone who doesn't think family scapegoating is not a serious issue that can have profound consequences.

And now you find fault with black people, with indigenous people, in order to try to feel better about yourself. Many in complex trauma had dads who were very angry. Anger was a huge issue. But what did dad do to justify his anger. He found fault with everything. it's not my fault I'm angry, it's that, all of that crap. That's the for my anger. Then I've seen something else that people do. They know in recovery that they need to develop some healthy friendships, to build a new support system with fairly safe healthy people. But that's a scary thing. Because the fear of rejection and abandonment is deeply ingrained. And what many people do when they start to get to know somebody, and they go, I this person, I should develop a friendship with them, fear kicks in. And what then does fear do is, I can't go there. That's too risky. how do I justify not developing a friendship with this person. I look for faults in that person. I look for all their flaws, to justify not developing a friendship with them. Another purpose for being negative and critical, is to justify your own flaws, and your own not changing. if somebody says, you are always inconsiderate or disrespectful, you might respond by saying, at least I'm not as bad as you. I'm not as bad as them, or them, or them. because they're worse than me, then that means I'm , I don't have to change. Sad that it happens much, but it does. Then, one of the extreme responses to extreme shame, is narcissism. Thinking I'm better than everybody, smarter, that everybody looks up to me, everybody thinks I'm better, I'm a genius. And what can happen in a narcissist, is they need to create the image, and maintain the image, of being better than everybody, smarter than everybody. And what they will do, to do that, is criticize stuff. Another thing that can happen, where this critical negative mindset, plays a role, is wanting everybody to agree with you.

And you gravitate back to it today without even realizing it. And when you get into relationships today, you naturally go back to this very old, unhealthy but what feels normal way of relating to people. And that can cause you to be actually attracted to unhealthy people, to set up relationship dynamics in the early days that are actually unhealthy and are going to destroy the relationship. what do you watch out for. just be aware that your initial go-to in any new relationship, is to sacrifice your needs. To give, to take care of the other person, to not express your needs, that somehow you are going to earn their love. If you're aware of that, don't fall into that. That is going to get you into trouble if you begin to follow that again. Also, you're also going to be attracted to people who have a very strong sense of self, who can take the leadership, who know what they want, who are very good at what they do, who are very good at what they do, and who are very good at what they do. And that can be healthy, but it can be very unhealthy. It can be a narcissist. But be aware that you're attracted to that, and that you're naturally then going to want to just go in and help, and take care of, and submit to them. as you get to know this person, be aware if they become very domineering and expect you to do things their way. Be aware if your partner becomes irritated or angry when you don't do what they want, when you disagree with them, when you don't take care of them the way they want.

When their limbic brain gets distorted, they're back into their limbic brain. They're triggered and they start into all that distorted thinking. What can they do to get back to their cortex, to get back to the facts that this is an unhealthy person, emotionally unavailable, neglectful, abusive. what they do is they write down all the things that person's done to them.

If you are a hypocrite, you have a great way of talking about what you're going to do, or what should be done, you just don't ever do it, that erodes trust. If you're inconsistent in enforcing rules, and boundaries, that will erode trust. If you're a people pleaser, and you're not good at saying no to others, that will erode trust with those closest to you. That's a lot of different things that erode trust. And you can see then that any unhealthy behavior has the potential of chipping away at trust. trust takes a lot to build, but it can be easily destroyed through unhealthy behaviors. Now I want to take this in a little different direction. remember that I said, you're committed to somebody initially because they have value to you. What I want you to think about is, especially for people from complex trauma, every day in a relationship, you are asking, does the person's words, actions, communicate that I still have value. That is the ongoing question in your mind. let me just break that down.",

That creates stress for yourself. You don't plan. You just spontaneously bounce around. That creates stress for yourself. You procrastinate. You stick your head in the sand. You avoid problems. That creates stress for yourself. what you're trying to do, your brain has been trained to just live for instant gratification. you avoid stress by doing something that immediately makes it feel less stressful in the moment, but it creates greater stress down the road. You're afraid to say no. That creates more stress down the road. You let yourself get involved in unhealthy relationships and don't set boundaries with unhealthy people. That creates more stress. You become preoccupied with what others think. You live with a guilty conscience that you haven't sorted out. You have a fear of change, a fear of failure, constant anxiety. That adds stress. You have all these resentments and unresolved conflicts that just eat away inside of you. That creates stress. You get into this negative thinking and awfulizing, catastrophizing everything. That creates stress. You go to the victim mentality, the self-pity. That creates stress.",

    "output": "I don't feel they're emotionally available either. And it breaks down over time. It breaks down over and over again. But sadly, it ends up validating the core belief that everybody that gets to know me will leave me because that is eventually what happens. what it ends up being is this cycle that keeps reinforcing the core belief of shame. I'm not good enough. Everybody that gets to know me will reject me and abandon me. End of story. End of story. And you're in this cycle and it keeps proving it to you, but you're afraid to leave that cycle. that leads me to my final question, and that is, how do we change that. we spend a lot of time in recovery from trauma talking about the need for healthy connection. And I don't want to take the time to go into detail on that. We've done lots of other stuff about that. But let me just say this tonight. I think one of the hardest things to do in that is to find some safe people who are somewhat healthy. And you go, where in the world do I look for that. And I get asked that all the time. But then there's a second, and it's probably even more difficult. It's to go about a relationship very slowly. I'm not going to rush into this. I'm going to very, very, very gradually, and by very, very, very gradually, I don't mean two weeks. I mean six months to a year, get to watch a person, know them, without getting sold out to that person in an unhealthy way. And over that time, I begin to see if there's red flags. I begin to see if they're healthy. I begin to see if there's even a chance of connecting. And if they are healthy, you begin to gradually connect. And as you connect, you can drop your mask, your guard, and you heal. But it's a very slow, gradual process. What makes it difficult for complex trauma is you think you have connection when you feel intensity. You mistake connection for the feeling of intensity. that's why you the intense relationships. That's all limbic brain. What you're wanting to do is realize connection happens gradually as you get to know a person who is safe and healthy.",

    "output": "I'll do this and there again just trying to get your hopes up. But they are trying to first all prolong the relationship and you dumping them and it's just part of their game. Be aware of that option number two. You get to the point where you go. This relationship. Is not going to work. You're in your cortex. You've checked the evidence. You've given that six months to a year. You've spelled out what you need them to do. They've done little bits, but there's not been lasting change. There's not been deep change. It is time to call it. Now, let me add a couple things. Do not do this unless you've carefully thought it through and you plan to stick to it. The worst thing to do is to make a rash impulsive decision in your limbic brain and just say I'm done. This relationships over and then two weeks later, you're lonely. You feel guilty and you asked to get back together again. I have seen countless couples do that. It just reinforces to the narcissist that your words mean nothing. Your boundaries mean nothing. You always will come back to them. why should they get serious about anything. make sure you think it through and that means think through money. Think through housing. Think through children. Think through legal. Think through. Do I have a support group. Do I have safety. Do I have a job. Do I have a place to live. All of those things have to be thought through. the key thing is this do not make decisions out of your limbic brain make decisions out of your core. Text based on the facts. what many people do is go the facts say they're unwilling to change but I'm still in love. He's such a wonderful person in the beginning. I think I should give him another chance. You're in your limbic brain. You're not looking at the evidence. Until you're in your cortex looking only at evidence with the limbic brain totally out of the picture. You probably will not make. A wise decision. Now, I need to add another piece here. Most people with complex trauma have always longed to be loved but have never been loved.",
