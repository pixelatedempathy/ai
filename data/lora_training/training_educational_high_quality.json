    "output": "I don't want to have quiet time where my brain starts to think. Think about this painful stuff. The second thing a child will do is they will minimize or downplay the severity of the betrayal. , it's not that big a deal. Everybody goes through it. It's not they do this to me or that to me. And there's an attempt to reduce the pain by trying to minimize the severity of what's happening to them. Some go far as to, block the betrayal from their mind. And they develop what is called dissociative amnesia. They don't even think about it. They forget about it. They just block it. Their brain is not allowed to go to that betrayal, that reality in their life because it's just too painful. And the child develops ways in their brain to block their brain from ever going back. Going there to ignore them because they need this relationship. they can't be honest about this relationship. And then another one, which is slightly different, but really important to understand is what we call betrayal blindness. the previous one is you block from your mind that this is even happening. But in betrayal blindness is you refuse. To admit the reality about this person. You want to see them with rose-colored glasses because you need them. there's a blindness that comes from, I need to maintain this relationship at all costs. I'm going to be blind to what this person is really or what they're doing. it's a form of psychological blindness. That protects the individual's mental and emotional safety by blocking out. What is too painful or too frightening to confront. And what a child might do is instead of blaming dad for betraying them, they might go to while it's my fault. They blame themselves. I deserved it. I caused it. I shouldn't have done what I did. It's my bad behavior. It's not my parents fault. That's betrayal blindness. And that happens a lot in complex trauma and it results in that shame belief that it's me. That's the problem. But let me go beyond that. those are the four most common childhood responses. But what. What's a bigger picture of how we respond to betrayal as we move into adult life. I want to break this into different areas.",

It's tools to ground, to de-escalate the limbic system. And rhythm is a big part of that. Then once regulated, you can go to the cortex. And as you go to the cortex, then you can tell time again. And you go, what. What just happened felt 40 years ago, but I'm not there 40 years ago, even though it feels it's still happening to me. And then you can go, what happened here. And you can reprocess the event and reprocess the trauma and learn from it. And healing will happen as you do that. Then the third.

You do it from a point of friendship towards yourself, not towards hostility towards yourself. You're a jerk. You need to change. You're terrible. Shame, shame, punishment, punishment. No, I'm changing from a friendship perspective, from a love perspective. There's another key skill that's necessary as part of this journey. And that's that emotional regulation. I said, many people can do in recovery until they get in intimate relationships. And that's when their deepest issues get triggered. And then they haven't got the tools to regulate themselves when they get triggered. And they just act out when they're triggered and they can do much damage. 97 of their life, they're a wonderful person. They're helpful and loving to people. 3 when they're triggered, they do a ton of damage. And they do damage to those who are closest to them. Those they least want to do damage to. And a key piece in this recovery journey is learning tools to manage those emotions when I'm triggered. And you can see those are tough things. there's really two approaches to that, which is important to understand. It's called top down and bottom up. And it really is referring to the brain. And the brain is a top down or bottom up. the top is the cortex. Then you have the limbic. Then you have the brain stem. top down is saying I regulate emotions through my cortex. I develop the capacity in my thinking to think my way through stressful times, times of anxiety, times of depression. I keep doing healthy behaviors. I keep my emotions up. I keep my emotions under control. I don't act out in my anger. I manage my anger that I'm still loving even though I might be upset. that's top down is learning those thinking tools. But most people realize that there are times in your life when you are triggered that you can't manage it with your cortex. You can't find a way through thinking to regulate that. And that's where you use a bottom up approach. And that's where I have to calm the brain stem in order to calm the limbic brain. And what they have found is there are many ways to calm the brain stem. Bottom up approaches.",

    "output": "You were likely carrying the accumulated, unmetabolized trauma of generations. The role of the scapegoat is a hot potato of psychic pain, passed down from parent to child, a cursed inheritance. The family system unconsciously seeks out the child who is perhaps the most sensitive, the most resilient, the one most capable of shouldering the unbearable burden of the family shadow. And in a stroke of cosmic irony, they choose the very person who, because of that sensitivity and resilience, has the greatest potential to finally wake up and put the damn thing down. And that is the choice point. That is the abyss you stand before when you escape. You have survived the fire. You have seen the system for what it is. You are holding this legacy of pain in your hands. Now what. You have two paths, and only two. The first is to allow the poison to do its work. It is to carry the bitterness, the rage, and the sense of victimhood into every new relationship you form to become a tyrant in your own , unconsciously seeking out new dynamics in which to replay the old trauma. That path is easy. It is the path of resentment. And it leads straight back to hell. The second path is the path of heroes. It is the decision to say, this stops with me. It is the voluntary adoption of the heaviest burden of all, the responsibility to ensure you are safe, and to ensure that this generational curse dies with your generation. You become the firewall. You become the end of the line. And what empowers you to do that. The wisdom you gained in the underworld. Surviving narcissistic abuse teaches you things about human nature that most people will, thankfully, never have to learn. You learn about the reality of malevolence. You learn about the terrifying power of deceit. But you also learn about the unbelievable resilience of the human spirit. You learn the difference between authentic love and its counterfeit. You develop an almost supernatural ability to detect manipulation. You learn, through the painful process of having your own boundaries violated for decades, how to build and enforce them with the strength of a fortress wall. This is what I see in my clinical practice all the time.",
