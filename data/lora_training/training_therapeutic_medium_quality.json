Because in my own experience, I mean, I've struggled off and on with my mental health over the years. I mean, I told you a bit about my story in our last conversation. And when I would go, there wasn't a lot of talk about my childhood. It was just , all , you're having some anxiety. Cool, here's a pill. And then I would just take it. And I would just think, , this is going to cure my anxiety. And then I would realize it's not really. I'm still getting anxiety. I'm still struggling. What's going on with this. And it wasn't until I understood my past and my trauma and how that was all related to what I was experiencing in the present that things were able to change. And let's just say that somebody has now, they found somebody they're comfortable with that's helping them heal their trauma and change their present and their current behaviors and patterns and that sort of thing. And then they go down weeks down the road, months down the road, and they're on the up and up, but get triggered. Or they experience a situation where they're , oh my gosh, I thought I was getting better. Why is this coming up. What's your advice to people who are dealing with triggers when they're on the road to recovery from trauma. , there's two ways to ask that question that you just raised. Why is this coming up. Is that a question. What is it actually. What is this teaching me. No. When you say, why is this coming up that. That's not a question. It's a statement. It's a statement that says, this shouldn't be happening to me. Now you ain't gonna learn anything that way. But if you actually ask it, , I wonder why this is coming up. Now you can learn something. If I came to you and said, , you're doing this. How would that feel to you. I would probably get defensive and I would just feel a little ashamed. Exactly.",

The entire truths can be contained in one sentence. it operates in the dimension of depth, not extension. Although of course paradoxically the Course in Miracles contains lessons. One part is the text, the other part is the lessons, 365 lessons, one for each day of the year. it gives you time in that sense. But it gives you time because you need time to remove time from your mind to speak. That's quite a paradox. Some of the Course in Miracles writings are quite poetic. They're almost little poems. And maybe I'll start with one of those little almost poems. They're quite beautiful. Perhaps the most profound one that I will start with comes towards the end of the Course, which is if somebody does the Course 360, it would be towards the end of the year doing the Course. This is the longest quote in our session today. it's actually a poem that I will read to you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I'll tell you when I'll start. And I think you will appreciate the beauty of it and then I will comment on the meaning. In case you need it, you probably don't. I don't know yet if I'm going to read it all in one, I read parts first and then comment on each part. There will come a time when images have all gone by and you will see not what you are.

It's never a slam dunk. You have to ask the question. And it's fascinating though, that's what you look for versus hearing that somebody has an affair or is a grandiose. , because that does totally make sense because that person wouldn't be putting that out there first.

Let's talk about cities for a minute. Are there more narcissists in cities versus elsewhere. And are we seeing more narcissists in general nowadays. I don't think we're seeing more narcissists in general. I think there's always been narcissistic people out there. I just don't think we had the name. But listen, enough people out there have narcissistic parents who can even look back in their family tree and say, , my grandparent was narcissistic. This has always been there. And in fact, a colleague of mine, Dr. Keith Campbell, him and I had a conversation about this, and it really stayed with me, because I think he's a tremendous expert in the field of understanding narcissism. And him and I agreed, this grandiose narcissism, the arrogant, posturing, swagger-y narcissistic person, that's staying steady. I think the reason we think there's more of it is social media. , I don't know what these people did before social media. I guess they sort of stayed narcissistic in their small little swimming pools. But when social media came along, we gave them the megaphone,. that's where they were the ones who grabbed it and said, look at me, and I'm just gonna sort of shamelessly put myself out in the world, that kind of thing. It was the vulnerable narcissism that I think has really, Sure, we did. gotten that, I think that form of narcissism, that more angry, aggrieved, hostile, mad at the world kind of narcissism. I think that has probably, and Dr. Campbell agrees, that has expanded. And I think the reason for that is that vulnerable narcissism, these are people who, when they sense that other people have it better than them or getting away with things, they get really mad. They feel they're being taken advantage of and that they're a victim. Vulnerable narcissists are forever the victim. And with social media, I think that's where we're at.

Sure. maybe they've gotten out of a long-term marriage. Maybe they were single for a very long time and at a time of their life, they're very career-focused and say, what. I want to share my life with a partner. My business went exactly the way I wanted. I'm going to enjoy. I'm going to reap the rewards of that. I want a companion. that's one path. We are an ageist society. not only are we a menopausist society, we are an ageist society. We are a menopausist society. ,. And those things tend to go together. Yes, they do. And we talk about this idea of the pressure a woman at 35 might have felt,. I want to have children. I want to get married. I want whatever. All my friends are married. I think there's a very similar pressure that shows up somewhere between 50 and 65, which is I want to go into this last third of my life, if you will, or these years of my life with a companion. I've got more time. , we know that actually aging with someone actually can often be a healthier thing, even if it's just someone keeping his eyes on you. Maybe not a narcissist. Not a narcissist. But there is this pressure. And then again, we have the ageism of many women. And again, I'm saying this from a clinical perch of saying, I'm 60. No 60-year-old man's going to want to date me. He's going to want to date someone significantly younger than me. And I don't know that I want to date someone who's 75. And there is this sense of, while I still feel I look good, I got to lock this down. And if there's one thing that makes people vulnerable to entering a narcissistic relationship, it's feeling a sense of time pressure. But if a person's been out of the dating world for a while, 30 years, maybe they got married. They raised kids. And in fact, some people will stay, even in an unhealthy marriage, until all their minor children turn 18 they don't have to deal with the nightmare of family court. And then 18 happens.",

I mean, I've talked to thousands of women. And when you're going into this and trying to figure out what's going on, there's only many things you can tackle at the same time. You're tackling symptoms. You're tackling not feeling , not sleeping, maybe weight gain. And then you've got this type of relationship going on here. they've got to handle one thing at a time. how can you create some type of boundaries around that. Is there a way. I don't even know if I'd use the word boundaries. I think the key is to understand the narcissistic person's ground game. You and they are not having the same relationship. The relationship for a narcissistic person is supply. It's convenience. It's what works for them. They expect you to read their minds. They expect you to be what they want when they want. You're a little AI creature that they want to sort of modify with them. You are in a relationship with someone you hope would be a partner that you want respect, and connection, and warmth, and empathy, and all that. you're not having the same relationship. I would say the most important thing that people have to remember at any phase of life, absolutely, but I think especially people who are in these relationships in midlife or starting or new in these relationships in midlife, do not isolate. The power of the narcissistic relationship happens when the person in the relationship is not hearing other voices. And by other voices, I mean people who are , you're great. You look wonderful. Talk to me about what's going on. Oh, all this menopausal stuff, I'm going through it too. Because the more validation we have that the stuff we're going through, our thoughts, our experiences matter, then we don't feel crazy. But if you're not doing it, then you're not going through it. If there are no dissenting voice, all you hear is the narcissistic person's version of reality, it's having only one polarizing news show on all the time.

And we know there's great research that shows that the reason, there's a lot of reasons women live longer, hormonal reasons, all this other stuff, cardiovascular reasons. But from a psychological perspective, something that really benefits women's lives in the long term is they're really good at making relationships. And friendships and socialization allow women to live longer. If nothing else, it gives them skin in the game. There are people you look forward to seeing, it's funny the things that make us kind of keep going longer,. Men are not as good at that. Men are terrible at making friends. They're terrible at making friendships relative to women. In fact, there was one. The New York Times had an article years ago. They called it the colonoscopy test. And they asked men, if you don't have a partner, how many people you have that would come and pick you up for a colonoscopy. And the men were scratching the barrel on one or two. And the women are all , oh, I've got nine people I could call to bring me home for my colonoscopy,. It's that one thing that everyone's got to do when they're 50,. Men are not good at this. And in fact, all the research shows marriage is better than sex. And it's , what's the difference between a woman and a man. It's not a matter of, oh, I'm going to be a partner. I'm going to be a partner. It's the woman's health. Because they've got somebody there. They've got someone there. And the men sort of poach off of the social network that the women have created. The friends, the couples, the social, all of it, that's usually the woman's work in the relationship. And I'm using a heterogender perspective here. But that is something that it's almost the runs over and the men are benefiting. But if a woman, midlife, any part of life, enters a narcissistic relationship, the risk of isolation goes way up. you no longer get those health benefits.

And that's a guilt is a very common reaction and survivors in these relationships.

There's a lot of empathy for that partner. We're , wow, they're really having to walk a difficult path here of the the ups and downs of their partner who's going through this hard thing. But the partner of someone who's narcissistic doesn't have that. Because by and large, the world sees the narcissistic partner as a titan, as a winner, as amazing, as helpful as generous, they paid for this one to go get this and they did that and they picked up the check and they took everyone on a vacation. And they're charming and they're charismatic and they hold court at the table. And isn't this all grand. And the partner, it's what I call sort of the dinner party effect.

We've referenced number of times in the conversation he because there is a prevailing bit of research that there's more men there with narcissism than women. Do you have a theory of why that is. I don't know why that is. , just let me put sort of the qualifier in there. There are different forms of narcissism, the sort of the big three are grandiose, vulnerable and malignant narcissism,. There's some other subtypes, but we stick with the big three. grandiose narcissism is that arrogant, charming, charismatic, look at me, I'm great. I'm gonna I'm the king of everything. That's the grandiose narcissists. The malignant narcissist is sort of that dark tetrad, the sort of the overlap of psychopathy, narcissism, sadism and Machiavellianism. Wow. And vulnerable narcissists are vulnerable narcissism. This is the money shot because we don't talk about this enough. And even the formulations on vulnerable narcissism. They've really only been discussed in earnest for about the past 20 years. Running Stan, these are the researchers in this the most cunning of them all. cunning and not cunning, the vulnerable narcissists are who end up in our offices, because the vulnerable narcissistic folks are more likely they don't present with the charm and the charisma and the and the dazzle. They actually are more often to present as failure to launch passive aggressive, victimize, aggrieved and disenfranchised. And that's what makes them dangerous, because they still have the entitlement, the selfishness, the dysregulation. This is every internet troll. This is a dangerous I actually think in some ways the vulnerable narcissists are every bit as dangerous as the malignant narcissists. And since these subtypes can combine, malignant, vulnerable narcissists are the most dangerous people in the world. And I want to say one piece about gender narcissism.",

You don't need to wait for more proof. You don't need to hope it gets better. You don't need to wait until your self esteem is shattered to finally believe what you already know in your gut. You can walk away now and I'm going to tell you how to recognize when that moment has come. The moment when it's time to just stop giving someone the benefit of the doubt, stop making excuses and just get out. Because a lot of people, especially many of us with childhood trauma, we're conditioned to ignore warning signs. Now you may even feel attracted to those warning signs and if that's you, no shame, but this video is for you. let's talk about what to look for when you're dating someone new. I'm going to give you three. Powerful categories of red flags. And if you see these signs early on, you run. All , number one, they're unavailable. And this is one of the most common patterns I hear from people, especially people who were emotionally neglected as kids. you meet someone and they're amazing and you're telling your friends, oh, we just clicked or I've never felt this way before. But then the facts start coming in and they don't quite add up. You ask if they're single and one time they say yes and a different time they say it's complicated. Or they tell you that they're divorced, but they're not actually divorced, they're separated. Or maybe they're still living with their ex and you're supposed to believe that it's just for the kids or it's for the mortgage or the health insurance or the dog. Or they're not living with their ex, but they're still talking about them constantly. They're tangled up in legal battles or emotional drama or toxic stories. And every conversation seems to come back to their ex. You end up being a sounding board for all their unresolved garbage from their last relationship. You ask where they live and they're vague,. Has that ever happened. It's not clear if they're in transition or they're lying or if you're ever actually going to see their home.",

That's what I'm saying it's wrong and I want to show you what I've learned to be the five crucial phases of healing from complex PTSD, all , because the dominant cultural idea about what counts as childhood trauma, what symptoms can be attributed to that and what to do about it is way out of date. I'm Anna Runkle also known as the crappy childhood fairy and I teach a new approach to healing trauma, one that just might be simpler for you to use and follow than what you're relying on now. If you sought help for your childhood PTSD you were probably encouraged to spend a lot of time talking to a professional about what happened, telling the story, and I know a lot of people need to do that at least once and I occasionally hear from people who say that in itself was very helpful, but if you were one of the many people with childhood trauma where talking about trauma and trauma and trauma and trauma and trauma and trauma and trauma and trauma and trauma and trauma and trauma and trauma and trauma and trauma and trauma and trauma and trauma and about it week after week just brings up anger and pain, you were then probably encouraged to then start taking medication and I occasionally hear from people who say that's what helped them move forward, but if you're me expecting those two things to solve the problem not only didn't heal anything it took you down and got you stuck, not feeling better, not handling life better, and then because we keep hearing how therapy and medication it's great and it works that's what you do. And it's not working for you not only aren't you getting better but you're feeling something extra is wrong with you since all this wonderful help isn't helping you, but what if that whole approach at least for you is just wrong and there's a better way because everything good in life depends now on finding what does work for you. All to point the way forward I'm about to outline for you five crucial stages of recovery.",

    "output": "And this is not just based on what has worked for me personally, I've worked with thousands of other people showing them my techniques, teaching principles that may sound at first kind of counter-intuitive, and reading and reading and learning what researchers are discovering about the nature of trauma and what's really going on in the brain because that is where in my experience healing has to begin. You can't intellectually figure out your own healing with a brain that's giving you wrong signals because your CPTSD isn't treated. It's a vicious cycle. you'll hear me say both CPTSD and childhood PTSD and they're not exactly the same thing. Childhood PTSD is a subset but it's a term that almost everybody understands. you start with brain healing and when that started for me I had the astonishing experience of just popping out of my trauma state. At first it was just little periods of time and then it got longer and longer and then it was enough to start healing the other effects of trauma. And it's necessary to heal. that's why I've been working with other people who are starting to do that healing if you want to stay healed and change your life. And now working with other people I've seen hundreds and hundreds go through a very similar process, a path that's both steady, it goes forward slowly and steadily and it's also punctuated with dramatic steps forward. And early on there's often this kind of popping out of it, an epiphany, it's a realization or a little burst of healing that happens when you suddenly release an old and wrong idea that's blocking you, from the path that's now going to take you to that place of ease and confidence and possibility. It sounds good. If you're skeptical that's good, that's and appropriate because healthy boundaries mean you shouldn't let anyone override your best judgment about how to heal, especially people on youtube. But just you can assess my approach I'll lay out for you the five crucial phases of healing and you can incorporate this into all the good stuff you're already doing and make this your best practice. if you are feeling you need to change anything or if you don't have anything that's working for you yet you can just make this what you're doing and see if this works.",

    "input": "How does childhood impact a person's life, and what are the steps to healing?",
    "output": "It looks that because we say one thing but then our actions are kind of different, we probably seem we're deluded when we're taking action and we keep making the same self-sabotaging mistakes over and over again even though we said we wouldn't. to someone who doesn't have cptsd it's easy to assume that this is some kind of decision we're making or a choice and if someone believes that then they kind of have to make it work for themselves by dressing it up with all kinds of psychological reasoning or rationales about why that would be or it's really just this. But the telltale sign that an idea or assessment isn't really the one in your case is that when you apply it just doesn't do anything for you. Results tell you something, there might be a tiny puff of belief or excitement when you first hear an explanation for why you're having problems but when you give it a few days or weeks and you try the technique and then you see it doesn't work there it is it doesn't work. Now knowing something even if it's true is not the same thing as having a solution. Especially I mean if it doesn't lead to your healing it's not a solution. It might work for other people but if it doesn't work for you it's just an idea and if your failure to respond to common treatment is making you then feel ashamed or different then it's really important to internalize that whole thing that that treatment was supposed to work for you it's a misunderstanding, it's wrong information. Let that come to you as a relief, you're normal, you're you and that is the first crucial phase of healing. Now the second phase is to understand the root cause of most of your symptoms and that is something called dysregulation. chronic stress and trauma in childhood can cause brain and nervous system changes that affect every system in your body. Those normally regulated systems become dysregulated. You'll hear me use that word all the time dysregulated. There's emotional dysregulation, there's dysregulation of brain activity from a flowing pattern into a chaotic pattern, there's dysregulation of hormones and that's what we're talking about. you're not going to be able to do a lot of things in your life.",

We're not failures, we're not stupid, we're dysregulated and this can be healed. And that is the third crucial phase of healing to learn to connect with other people. This is probably the single hardest thing because it's the worst impact area of childhood trauma on adults. Feeling an outsider for example, feeling you didn't get the memo on how to act or you're good at acting you're fine but you never feel you're safe, to be yourself. You feel lonely even in crowds and of course romantic relationships for many of us are dreadful or obsessive or non-existent. It's not supposed to be this way. I say it again and again childhood PTSD is an injury to our ability to connect with people and connection can be learned. Now when you're more regulated it's easier to connect and it works the other way too. More connection helps you get more regulated. the fourth crucial phase of healing is all about facing your own self-defeating behaviors. do you ruin relationships with anger. Are you isolating. Do you have addictions or a problem with food and weight that's hurting your health. These are all trauma related and a lot of traumatized people stay stuck with these problems all their lives. But when you're regulated and connected a little more you can begin to change these things and that's an honorable and holy project to keep facing your own mistakes and making day-to-day changes in a positive direction. This is everything. This is where life starts to get much more open and much happier. And then comes the fifth crucial phase and that's when you're able to shed your old limited idea of yourself stuck in resentment or hopelessness or identified with the trauma or feeling paralyzed about it. And that's when you're able to shed your old limited idea of yourself stuck in resentment about it. And that's when you're able to shed your old limited idea of yourself stuck in resentment about taking action or trying to please people who come on man they're never going to be pleased with anything you do.",

They're people who can accomplish great things for the benefit of the world and we get to watch as people come in with this kind of hard edge of feeling life is meaningless and empty and threatening and as they gradually sort of lighten up and drop the burdens and then start to shine that, there's just nothing better.

We could lose what little hope we still have, but you're going to find that it doesn't tend to play out that way. It's subtle. Good is subtle and you can actually always stop it from happening. That's in my 29 years of healing, I've just sometimes kind of freaked out everything's changing fast, I'm afraid where this is going, I'm afraid it's going to make me alone, and then I just stop using my tools. You pull away from people who support your healing. We've all done it. Sometimes it feels necessary, but then when you're satisfied that not healing isn't what you want really, you can just let that warm river carry you along. I'm very gently towards your own goodness and fulfillment. To be demoralized means to be deflated of all that makes you strong.

You definitely get disempowered, but it takes that disempowerment one terrible step further to where you lose your awareness or valuing of what is good. When you're demoralized, you turn away from what is good and true and morally. You don't even know what good is anymore. You can't detect what is or what's important. And when you're demoralized, you believe that good is, , whatever I want it to be, whatever everybody says. And many people will tell you that this is the case, that it's totally subjective and it's rude to assume wrong from. But if you really believe this, that what is good, is unknowable or that seeking what is good is rude, then everything becomes meaningless and pointless. No wonder we get demoralized. And when we're in that state, it's almost impossible to imagine that anything we do can make a difference. Has this happened to you. Trauma can definitely do that to a person. And if that's where you are now, it is important that you start healing it.

It's too late for me or what about if nobody cares about you and nobody ever helped you or things anyone who was traumatized just becomes a target for narcissists it's best to just avoid people because people suck. These are the things that people say when they're demoralized. Their belief that good exists in the world and within them that good can come into their lives and change their experiences and their circumstances it's been shut down and you can hear by the cynicism and the scolding tone of this kind of comment that it's painful for them to hear messages of hope. They come to the channel they watch a video which is a hopeful act by the way but something snaps shut and won't allow them to apply it to themselves. It's a self-destructive act.

It doesn't change depending on what mood you're in. We know there's evil in the world. We know there's evil in the world. We know there's good and mostly people are good.",

    "output": "Now whatever you read online or you see in the news mostly people spend their days cooperating with each other helping each other doing work that's mostly to serve the cause of good and yes there are exceptions and when you're demoralized your mind tells you that the exceptions prove that the rule that most people including you are pretty good it can't be true. That's what your mind tells you in demoralization. That kind of demoralization is what you're doing. You're doing it for the good. That kind of thinking is a hallmark of demoralization and it can bring the worst out in people and it can do a lot of damage. Demoralization has happened to people throughout history. They fell into it or they were intentionally manipulated into it. It happens to little communities and it happens to whole countries and this is very dangerous because when people are demoralized they're very susceptible to a loss of unity. They turn against each other. They're quick to anger. They're full of fear. They're quick to blame and they're easily led and if hearing this makes you think of other people that I'm going to suggest that's exactly what demoralization wants you to think. It wants you not to look at yourself. It wants you to blame other people by categories or individuals and ignore anything that you can actually change for the better. Demoralization needs you to grow cynical to turn your back on problems and stop trying. Whole generations have lived through demoralization and then come through on the other side toward what can we call it remoralization. The recovery of a lived sense that good is possible and that with our innate goodness if we work on it we can make it real in the world. Now I feel strongly about this in terms of childhood PTSD that healing can only happen when we fix our eyes on a vision of what is possible and not keep expecting that focus on what happened in the past is going to change the world. It's not going to change anything. Yes you may need to discuss it or get it acknowledged but the focus goes on the vision. If you don't have a vision there's nothing to do but go in circles with your trauma. The solution, the change comes from focusing on what is holding you back now.",

But if you're open to this, I'll tell you what happened. I was a heavy smoker for 16 years before I quit. I was at two packs a day. That's 40 cigarettes. It's hard to smoke 40 cigarettes in a day, but not for me. Sometimes it was even more. And I wanted to quit bad. I had made, I think, about 30 serious attempts to quit. I'd get a few days, maybe a few weeks, and then I'd relapse and go full-on addicted immediately, which was depressing and demoralizing. I was ashamed of myself and I kidded myself that people didn't know how bad the problem was. I started to smoke because I heard that I'd lose weight. And I did at first. And I knew that my mother had smoked. I knew that my mother had smoked. And I knew that I'd smoked really heavily while she was pregnant with me. And I wondered if this explained why the little buzz of nicotine that I'd get from that first hit of a cigarette felt comforting and womb- from the very first time I smoked. And I used to stand outside and take a drag off my cigarette and think to myself, God, I love smoking. Cigarettes, for me, they were a way of taking a break. They were a way to collect myself. They functioned, I'm pretty sure, as a very crude anti-inflammatory. And I knew that I was going to die. And I knew that I was going to die. And I knew that I was going to die. And I knew that I was going to die. And I knew that I was going to die. And I knew that I was going to die. Cigarettes were very anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medicine for a while. They were re-regulating me. I used them to push down anger and sadness. And I was really angry and really sad. Cigarette gave me just a little extra distance from people. When you have childhood PTSD, that distance is something inner strength. It's not inner strength, but depression that would just bring me down.",

Rather than just focusing on symptom reduction as the outcome, these new guidelines focus on the fragmentation of identity and dissociation and chronic shame and relationships and attachment disruptions and emotional regulation, in addition to the reduction of symptoms. it's a much more, not just a more holistic approach or more holistic way of understanding trauma, but also a more holistic way of understanding what it means for a treatment to be effective. this is a big shift from what's your diagnosis or what's wrong with you. And instead of focus on what happened to you and how it's shaped your sense of self, your sense of safety and your sense of connection in the world. these seven APA guidelines for treating complex trauma and complex PTSD are broken up into an acronym history.

They must be empathetic and co-located. Let me have that for the client. compassionate, that we've got to counter that sense of dehumanization that our clients are left with after complex trauma. humanistic approaches emphasize agency and collaboration and choice and empowerment and strengths. This means really validating the survival responses our clients have used, affirming their identities and working together, collaborating, co-creating treatment goals. in this first treatment guideline for complex PTSD, we see a lot of the same key words that came from SAMHSA's trauma-informed care standards, which are covered in other videos on this channel. The second guideline for complex PTSD treatment is that it's got to be integrative, that there's no single modality or treatment that works for everyone, that we've got to recognize there's multiple pathways to healing from trauma and especially the healing from complex trauma. This means as mental health professionals that we've got to integrate multiple approaches together, that we can't just rely on talk therapy, or we can't just rely on cognitive behavioral therapy. We can't just rely on IFS or EMDR, but we've got to be trained in multiple modalities, or we've got to put together a treatment team for each client that they can experience multiple approaches to healing from trauma. This involves including the expressive arts therapies and body-oriented approaches, and spiritual and existential frameworks beyond just cognitive approaches. That we need to engage in both top-down approaches, which are the more cognitive approaches that work from the top of the brain down to try to change behavior in the body, and also the bottom-up approaches, which are the body-oriented approaches, where we work with sensations and posture and body language and nonverbal communication. We work with how the trauma lives in the body in order to impact other parts of the body. we've got to combine memory processing with skills building and meaning making. Our approaches have got to be integrative rather than over-relying on just cognitive approaches, or over-relying on just body-oriented approaches.",

This means that we've got to work from a three-phase approach to treating trauma. And particularly, we've got to work from a three-phase approach to treating trauma. Pretty much all the treatments for trauma, complex trauma, articulate this in different language. That phase one is about safety, it's about stabilization, it's about coping skills and relationship forming. Phase two is about trauma processing, dealing with the rage and the anger and the defenses and the grief and the shame and the fear and the terror. And phase three is about integration, about meaning making, about transformation and post-traumatic growth, about reconnection. And these three are the three key guidelines for treating trauma.

And that's what we're going to be doing. And this goes even beyond just the client's timeline, but across generations, that complex trauma is often generational in that it can get passed down from generation to generation and that the experiences of complex trauma, not only are they transgenerational, but they're also systemic in that historical traumas get passed down from generation to generation and have a real impact on the clients that we're working with. this could include. And we've got to be very clear about this. And this could include the trauma of slavery or the historical trauma of gender discrimination or the historical trauma involved in many of our ancestors' immigration experiences or genocide, war, famines, discrimination, all these different types of historical and ancestral traumas. Although they may have happened decades ago and centuries ago, they still can have a real impact on the clients that we're working with. we've got to take this into consideration. Now the fifth key guideline for treating complex PTSD and complex trauma is that it's got to be outcomes focused. And in this guideline, APA really argues that we've got to go beyond just looking at symptom reduction as the primary outcome, that we've got to look at co-occurring disorders, mood disorders, addictions, eating disorders, somatic symptoms, suicidality, that when we're working with complex trauma, we're going to be focusing on the outcomes. And that's really what I'm focused on.

After decades of research, Dr. Jennifer Freid has coined the term betrayal blindness to describe our inability to recognize betrayal, especially when the perpetrator is someone or something we trust. For example, a parent who abuses a child, or a partner that cheats, or a church that hides abuse. If you have been listening to Navigating Narcissism for a while, you've heard me talk about Dr. Freid time and again. Her work is key to understanding what happens to survivors of narcissistic abuse.

And, in a way, it's the very person that you have a reason to trust and depend upon is the perpetrator of a harm.

And in devising this theory, I began to start to measure betrayal trauma and found that betrayal traumas, which are defined as significant mistreatment by somebody that the victim is dependent upon, trusts, and is close to, that they are very toxic, that they have negative effects on almost every system we looked at. , people's mental health, physical health, substance misuse, behavioral problems. It's very toxic stuff. In order to better understand betrayal trauma, Dr. Frey developed what she calls the Brief Betrayal Trauma Survey. This 12-question form can help someone recognize the amount of betrayal trauma they've encountered based on their personal experiences. This survey is available in the show notes and on our Instagram page at navigatingnarcissismpod. It's very relational. And what we've learned over time is it's relational even if the entity harming you is bigger than a person, such as an institution.

And one of them comes from not being able to have betrayal blindness, that it is inherently a bad thing that is happening to a person. It can mean, for instance, a child who cannot use betrayal blindness, may end up actually getting kicked out of the house because their awareness is intolerable. Let me ask you this then, because the way you're saying a child who can't use betrayal blindness, a child who can't use betrayal blindness, the way you're describing it, it sounds a conscious process.

And that's a cultural trust. And this is largely the work of Jennifer Gomez. And that then adds additional pressure to maintain the status quo when there's any kind of disruption within that group. that adds to the cultural pressure to have betrayal blindness.

And there would almost be greater harm through ostracism that would happen if a person did that, as the shame that it would bring upon the entire family. This connects to one of the stories that was in your book, the story of someone you called Kevin in your book. And the story of Kevin hit me profoundly. I grew up in the 1970s in the United States, as. What you captured in his story is that somebody who's not of majority race, and especially at that time in history, I still think it's an issue, but it was even more pronounced. In Kevin's case, he was told that if he assimilated good, things would happen. But he played by all those rules in this larger system of the culture, of school, of education, all of that, and he was still ostracized. And that the betrayal blindness for him is, this is fair. This is all fine. Yes, I can assimilate. And I'll play the sports that the other kids play.",

Can you share that story from the book. Julie was a woman who had on the surface totally succeeded in life. She had a really thriving profession and lived in a beautiful home and in, , appeared to be a very happy person and in a lot of ways was. But she told me about her past and in her past. And. Clearly, she was still disturbed by this. In her past, she was in a different relationship where her spouse was cheating on her and abusing her. I believe financially she was utterly dependent on him and trapped in the house with him. When she walked in on him one time. Kissing another woman, she was the first one to use that word whoosh with me. She described. Seeing the kiss and somehow managing to whoosh it out of her mind. that it wasn't there anymore. And it was in a public place too. I mean, it was kind of a remarkable feat of betrayal blindness. But it allowed her. In this highly dependent situation to stay in relationship with her husband, who she believed and arguably really did need to stay in the house. To come back with. Back to her father, who was already in public, who was still out with her, rather knowing her sort. And she wasus. He wasn't a ton, but she was looking for out a way with which he could take some things away from her. she took him into hook-and-crook. And this was what took her young adult manico or young autor the documents, didn't you think it was summer I stood it up. Through your feet. that the young ick organization asked me this story. And this is, and this is not. This is a shame that none of these programs were supposed to carry up. Because these we use. To create chaos. Because all of a sudden. We are no longer able. Know. she was this highly successful person. It's remarkable because I think that framework of, of she literally saw her husband kissing another woman and still managed to whoosh it out.",

As you hear this, you will notice that there is a lot of tension between us. There is a lot of tension between us. There is a lot of tension between us. If you heal from a toxic relationship and may even be angry at yourself for not fighting back, it seems pretty likely that you were in an asymmetric relationship where fighting back may have felt too risky. Where fighting back may have felt too risky. Where fighting back may have felt too risky. In this next takeaway, Dr. Fried points out that betrayal blindness tends to become our normal, and if you had to learn to use it as a child, you are more likely to use it as a go-to as an adult. This is an important pattern for survivors to explore and lines up with what we observe as the legacy pattern of people who experienced childhood narcissistic abuse also finding themselves in similar relationship cycles in adulthood. Next, betrayal blindness and its effects remind us that there is no way to win in these relationships. These are relationships with people we trust or need to trust parents. Seeing betrayal feels harmful because we may not be able to safely do anything about it but not seeing the betrayal takes a toll on our health. As Dr. Fried said, this is a survival mechanism that comes with a cost. The process of betrayal blindness allows us to maintain the status quo and our lives the way we may want them to be but this process of whooshing, as Dr. Fried calls it, takes a real toll on us. For this next takeaway, self-blame is the pattern that most survivors struggle with. Betrayal blindness can help take some of that apart. By not acknowledging the betrayal, and then if you take the blame for the betrayals, you won't see the other person as responsible, which is where shame comes in. Most survivors feel ashamed that they got mistreated and this brings up the idea that you could have done something to stop the betrayal from happening. All of this means that survivors then think, this is my fault, which is not true. Which then means you can stay in the relationship. Self-blame then tragically fosters attachment, which is essential.",

And as I've explored this topic, I've found that it's really relevant to me because I'm not an angry person, of course. And then I look at myself and I find out, , maybe you should think about this, Emma. today I invited the amazing one and only Sarah Michelle to talk about anger as a root cause of anxiety. And she's a psychologist, substance abuse counselor, tons of experience, really wonderful. Can't wait to jump in to this topic with you today. , let's go. I think a lot of people don't think anger and anxiety are that connected, but are they. Yes, there's a zillion reasons why people get anxious and depressed. But to me, anger is significant. And I'm going to give you to start a few examples. Let's hear it. , of how I discovered this. All. I'm in AA, , in Alcoholics Anonymous. I've been sober for 40 years. And one of the things you do when you first get sober is you do what's called an inventory. And I remember I saw myself as this very sweet, very nice, very kind human being. I was becoming a therapist. I was in my early 20s. I'm 65 now. that's a long way. And I remember saying to my sponsor, she said, , you need to write down people you're angry at. And I said, geez, I'm not really aware of being angry at anyone. And she said, no, really, resentment is in the, there's a quote in the big book of AA, resentment is the number one offender of the alcoholic. And after a bunch of work with her, I ended up kind of, , I ended up getting a lot of money. I ended up getting a lot of money. I ended up getting a lot of money. I ended up getting a lot of money. I ended up getting a lot of money. I ended up getting in touch with some feelings. I didn't even feel anger. I just felt kind of an irritation. Bottom line to this story is 486 resentments later. I was, oh my gosh, maybe I'm a little angry. But again, the thing to me was my presentation was anxiety.",

And I was just kind of a little bit of a nuisance in the household, all that stuff. when I experienced things, it was either high anxiety, medium anxiety, low anxiety. But when I started to look at resentment and anger, anxiety started to go down. And when I process in that process, we can talk about how to do some of that work. When I did this process of the steps and got through a lot of those resentments, et cetera, I remember the thing was go sit with God for an hour was the assignment. and see what happens. And I remember feeling this liberation and freedom and calmness and peace that I hadn't felt in years. that's just one personal experience of being totally unaware that I had anger and resentment and feelings towards anybody in negative ways. And it was definitely in there manifested in other ways. P. S. it probably had a lot to do with my addiction. A couple of other examples with clients slash friends. I have a really good friend who's bipolar. We were together just recently, and I've heard this a zillion times before, and she was telling me how over the winter she had a hypomanic episode. And again, bipolar is a legitimate diagnosis, et cetera. We're not saying that. I said, , and again, this is one of my analyst mentor in graduate school always said this question, when did it start.

And that night I was feeling all this rage and I couldn't sleep. And then I was obsessively thinking, she said within three days I had a hypomanic episode. Now I'm not saying again, but I am saying correlation. I'm saying we get this rage and if we don't know how to process it or identify it or even experience it, it's going to come out in some other way. that was one other example.

choose the option that is the most rewarding or the least painful let's talk about codependency here people are faced with a choice do I address the codependency and get out of this what I can even see objectively is an unhealthy relationship or do I stay in this relationship that I know that is meeting certain needs now that I can predict that I feel I've got some element of control whereas change is a complete unknown you can see why some people may have difficulty choosing to move towards a different way of interacting people will often not change until it's more painful to stay the same than it is to change think about times when you've tried to change anything you've tried to start exercising you've tried to change a particular behavior it takes energy it takes effort and it's uncomfortable whatever you're trying to do differently is often means taking away something that was in some way rewarding if you start to try now my kids have recently moved out and I've had to take

when the person realizes that the change is the only way to stop the pain in codependency the person who is codependent will look around at their life and they'll say this is my vision of a rich and meaningful life and gosh most of the things that are important to me are going to hell in a handbasket now because of this relationship maybe it's time for a change because the pain is worse than staying the same I do want to mention that most people with codependent behaviors have a history of abandonment trauma that has caused them to develop complex post-traumatic stress and I mentioned

a quote addictive Behavior it's a behavior and it may be an addictive Behavior in a in an addictive relationship but it's serving a function what function is that often to provide a sense of safety and security to somebody who is terrified of a abandonment and rejection codependent behaviors often develop during that traumatic time to help the person try and survive now why did I not say childhood sometimes codependency doesn't develop in childhood sometimes it's the result of being in a relationship with somebody that starts not healthy and then they develop an addiction and you continue to try to pursue them and quote fix them and get the person back that you initially got together with for people to be willing to recover or change any behavior they must be motivated the more important the behavior to survival the more intense the motivation must be if I am going to get motivated to use my earlier example to Swiffer and dust every evening when I come home that's not super important to survival it doesn't take a whole lot of motivation for me to say I can get up off the sofa and do this if I'm going to change something huge then getting out of a relationship that is clearly serving a function at this point then the motivations off of that obviously going to have to be a lot stronger what does hitting bottom look in codependency remember people are obsessively anxious they're hyper vigilant to what's going on they're constantly trying to keep the dysfunctional other from relapsing they're constantly trying to protect these dysfunctional other from the consequences of their own actions they're constantly trying to keep the dysfunctional other from becoming angry becoming distressed or experiencing anything that might cause them to relapse it's exhausting and it takes a crap ton of energy physically the person with codependency often experiences sleep impairment that underlying hyper vigilance and anxiety and feelings of disempowerment and unsafeness because of the situation often keeps them from getting that good sleep as a result of impaired sleep and high tension and high stress they experience increased pain and illness including exacerbation or even development for some people of autoimmune issues there's low energy not only because of a lack of sleep but because their body is constantly revving for the next shoe to drop and some people develop substance use or addictive behaviors now why didn't I say addictions may not rise to the level of being an addiction but they may start heavily using substances or other behaviors in order to try to escape from the pain of the codependent relationship affectively or emotionally the obsessive anxiety turns to major depression or explosive anger when people with codependency start to get to the point where they're hitting bottom they start to become emotionally dysregulated when they're not raging when they're not furious or frantic they're flat or depressed and just don't have the energy and it's usually one extreme or the other and they start to notice that they feel their emotions come in tidal waves instead of sprinkles they're often played with regret and resentment they regret the things that they've lost as a result of the relationship they resent the dysfunctional other for putting them in that position they resent other people for abandoning them when they wouldn't leave the dysfunctional other there's a lot of regret and resentment both of which by the way are anger feelings to go around and as I mentioned there's frequent emotional dysregulation cognitively there's hyper vigilance the person is constantly scanning for any clues that the dysfunctional other may be getting ready to relapse or abandon them they're hyper vigilant to every non-verbal every verbal clue and they start to engage in mind reading you looked at me sideways therefore you must be thinking this and that means bad things are going to happen they start second guessing or assuming they know the other person's feelings thoughts and intentions when you're this stressed out when you're this hyper vigilant constantly scanning constantly looking for hints that it's going to go bad you can't concentrate your body is not able to say hey I'm in the middle of this flat fight or flee response but let's focus on the Excel spreadsheet now it ain't gonna happen the person hitting bottom all starts to engage in stinking thinking which is another term we use in addiction but generally it's characterized by all or nothing thinking you're either all for me or you're against me and it's either all my fault or it's not my fault at all and personalization a lot of people with addictive behaviors including codependency personalize everything you're angry it must be my fault you relapsed it must be my fault you had a bad day and crashed the car somehow it must be my fault and cognitively I didn't know where to stick this one people who are hitting bottom in any addiction often say that they're sick and tired of being sick and tired they are over it they have run out of energy they've run out of motivation they've realized that something needs to change environmentally when the person is hitting bottom remember I said the pain of staying the same has to be worse than the pain of change because change is hard making amends is hard letting go of control is hard but the person who's hit bottom in codependency looks around one day and realizes they've lost pretty much everything the friends that they used to have kind of washed their hands and been I can't be party to this anymore I can't enable this behavior family has done the same thing a lot of times in codependency whatever the dysfunctional others issue is whether it's mental health issues or addiction issues it costs a lot of money the money is gone the person with codependency very often has problems at work at the very least or loses their job because they are obsessed and consumed with enabling the dysfunctional other they call in sick or they don't focus at work or they make mistakes or all of the other emotional and cognitive issues make their productivity and work product just kind of disappear their health has also gone they look around remember I said they have increased pain increased illness reduced sleep a lot of times people with codependencies realize that the stress of the relationship is impairing their immune system it's impairing their health is actually literally killing them and often when the person with codependency hits bottom they may have lost the dysfunctional other the dysfunctional other may be steeped in their problem in their issue that they realize that the person with codependency realizes on some level I can't bring them back from this and the dysfunctional other may be actually pushing them away going what get out of my life I just I can't deal with having you around anymore relationally the person who's hitting bottom with codependency has low self esteem to begin with but now they're really feeling empty and worthless because with codependency they had a very unstable or weak sense of who they were and a sense of self is what we call it and when they are no longer needed when they are no longer caretaking for the dysfunctional other they don't know what their job is they don't know who they are they don't know what they're supposed to do and that starts to feel really terrifying compulsive caretaking also starts to turn to helpless the person who's hitting bottom starts looking at the dysfunctional other going no matter what I do no matter how much I turn my life upside down and hurt myself you're not changing and they start to develop a lot of resentment towards the dysfunctional other they're not ready to let them go yet but they're starting to get really angry and resentful but they feel helpless to change anything they're terrified to let go but they're also recognizing that they can't change it in psychology again I said Martin Seligman devised a term called learned helplessness and when we continue when we do things and no matter what we do there's a painful consequence at a certain point sometimes we just give up and lay down and take it and that's where we're at with people when they're hitting bottom what does it mean to let go what does it mean to change letting go of these codependent behaviors is terrifying that for many people means letting go of control and if they in the past if they've let go of control bad things have happened letting go of this relationship and letting go of these behaviors that have worked to some extent until now is terrifying sometimes I'll do an activity with the people I work with where we talk about reframing letting go what are you letting go of but then what are you getting control of vulnerability when you're letting go you become very vulnerable when you don't have somebody else that you're trying to control you don't have somebody else that is providing structure on the same end yes you're vulnerable but now you only have to use your energy to control yourself and you can use it to move towards those things that are important letting go of codependent behaviors means accepting that you could not change or fix it or them that's terrifying because it often represents the fact that you may not have been able to change other relationships as however you also when you do that the flip side is you start to recognize that it wasn't me it was something that was not changeable but it was not me when you let go of codependent behaviors you grieve the loss of the fantasy you're not going to get the person back that you thought you were in a relationship with or that you hoped you could make out of this Diamond in the rough it ain't gonna happen that's terrifying and heartbreaking there's some grieving that happens when you let go of those codependent behaviors but you also get with it and increased awareness and appreciation of the present moment I'm not going to get this prince that rides in on a white horse ain't gonna happen what do I have in the present moment and when you let go of codependent behaviors it means you've got to learn a whole new skill set feel very overwhelming however what you're doing is gathering tools to help you be the person you want to be and there's no time frame it's not you've got to learn all these skills in two weeks you've got time to do it if the videos on this channel have been helpful for you please support us in our mission to make high

letting go of a dream they're letting go of a lot of things control remember in the grief process we have denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance when a person hits bottom the grieving process denial when they're in that place they're still saying it's them and not me i can fix them then they're going to love me and i'll feel happy once they bust out of that denial a lot of people move to anger and we see the person with codependency bounce back and forth between all of these feelings while they're in the relationship it's kind of interesting there is an ongoing grief process then they move to anger if the dysfunctional other would only do what i tell them things would be and i could relax they don't appreciate my sacrifices they're angry that they can't control the person and they're angry and feeling unappreciated and they're going to feel they're not and appreciated bargaining all let me step back maybe if i do x y and z then they're then they'll change let me let me see can i bargain with you if i do these things will you quote behave and the dysfunctional other may say yes may say no but the person with codependency is still trying to figure out how to make it work depression you makes them change it's hopeless I am helpless and that is the place where the person is really hitting that bottom when they're hopeless and helpless they recognize what they've been doing ain't working and it probably never will work they're having to find something else they're having to let go of this pattern and finally acceptance continuing to do what I've been doing and expecting different results is insanity it's another phrase that we often use in recovery circles my life with this person has become unmanageable and I'm powerless to change them that's step one of codependence Anonymous I have to make a change if I want the things in my life that are important and that is the final assertion in acceptance when the person has accepted that they have to let go of this dream this fantasy this relationship hitting bottom is part of the grieving process when making a significant change one of the things that you can do to raise the bottom which means to organize literature now is the money where is and one of the Chris platypus ideas that I vividlyied in your fooled the step I use is to increase activism the true creation of knowledge and understanding as a result will increase you in your life volleyballrences to increase awareness of what works and doesn't connect you with can be large concatenating earlyquelic encourage you not to use words but to actually do a collage because if you're talking about harming the relationship with your kid and you have to put a big red X through your kid's face that's kind of startling when you step back and look at it can be a wake-up call once people start becoming more aware they're going to become more motivated but a lot of people with codependency if not all are terrified of being alone because they don't know who they are if they're alone they may not have ever been in a place where they haven't been taking care of someone they don't know what to do the loneliness the trauma the depression the anxiety the grief everything they're going through they think oh my gosh if I have to go through this alone it might just completely overwhelm me which is why it's important to join a support group or begin counseling but this is what I call placing an anchor when you are rock climbing or mountain climbing as you go up you periodically place anchors if you start to slip you're not going to fall all the way back to the bottom you're only going to fall a little bit of the way place an anchor support groups codependents Anonymous adult children of foreign alcoholics there are a lot of different free support groups out there your community also may have other support groups for codependency final thoughts recognize that the recovery from codependency requires that you grieve the loss of the relationship with the dysfunctional other there was something about that relationship that was very important to you grieve the loss of the hope for a relationship with the imaginary dysfunctional other and I mentioned this earlier the diamond in the rough a lot of people who are codependent get involved with others dysfunctional others who need to be rescued or seem to need to be rescued the person with codependency sees them as a diamond in the rough I'll just polish them up and I will make them into this shiny Diamond that ain't gonna happen other people may have been in a relationship with the person when they were healthy and then the person developed an addiction or other problem and they hold on to this dream of having the Jim Bob that they married back and that person may not come back if the current Jim Bob is steeped in addiction or trauma or something else the repeated loss of the original dysfunctional other is another thing to grieve most people who are codependent or have codependent behaviors have some original traumas that every time a relationship breaks up especially a codependent relationship that initial relationship that didn't work out which is often with a caregiver is repeated they feel they're losing dad or mom all over again and it's going to be important to grieve that the original dysfunctional other that started all of this and they need to grieve all of the things that they've lost along the way as a result of these dysfunctional relationships there's a lot of grieving to go around related videos are linked in the notes to this

    "output": "hey there everybody and welcome to this presentation on codependency and addictive behavior resulting from insecure attachment I'm your host Dr Donnelly snipes in this presentation we're going to start out by defining attachment and codependency and then we'll explore codependency as a consequence of insecure attachment we will also discuss ways codependency might also be conceptualized as a person or a relationship addiction and then finish out by starting to identify a few strategies for people to begin recovering from codependency is often regarded as a consequence of being in a relationship with someone with an addiction sometimes it's thought of as being an addiction itself in which the relationship is what needs to be abstained from and other times it's thought of as just somebody who has poor relationship skills and I really want to challenge all of those and kind of put a big bow on it and say yes there's elements of all of those things that may exist but being in a relationship with a person with an addiction is not necessary in order to develop a pattern of codependent relationships this presentation is going to challenge you to look at codependency as a symptom of insecure attachment stemming often from childhood trauma that we commonly call aces or adverse childhood experiences what is attachment describes the quality of the relationship between people and when we're little we are supposed to develop a secure attachment with our primary caregivers these are the people who are supposed to feed us when we're hungry give us a blanket when we are cold keep us safe when we're scared they're the people that are supposed to as we get older help us learn to identify our emotions tolerate that distress cope with the distress develop perspective taking skills and the ability to empathize with other people communicate how we feel and what our wants and needs are set health healthy boundaries and develop self-esteem now that's a lot of stuff if somebody doesn't have a secure attachment in infancy and childhood they are often left scrambling to try to develop these skills but as some people often say you don't know what you don't know people don't know that they're they have low emotional intelligence unless somebody's presented the concept of emotional intelligence to them a lot of people who grew up in these environments in which the caregivers were struggling with mental health problems or addiction issues or maybe even environmental issues poverty that they were working two jobs and they had difficulty being present were home they were just freaking exhausted all the time we want to look at those things and i do want to underscore that adverse childhood experiences are not intentional a parent doesn't think to themselves hey i want to be emotionally unavailable to my kid most parents don't have children and go what you bother me go away most parents want to engage with their children when they can a lot of adverse childhood experiences and trauma is the result of parents who or caregivers who were ill-equipped or unable or overwhelmed in some way secure attachment is what results if you don't have secure attachment you have insecure attachment and there are basically three styles of insecure attachment the anxious attachment this is the child or the adult who is terrified of being alone terrified of abandonment and is always on the lookout for are you going to abandon me they desperately want to be in relationships they desperately crave that closeness but they also desperately fear losing it they are constantly on guard and that's exhausting then you have avoidant attachment and this is the person who grew up to recognize or to believe that nobody can be trusted and it's not even worth investing emotional energy in other people i don't i just don't even have time i don't want to be around you because you're going to leave me i know you will disappoint me i know you will let me down i just don't even want anything to do with it you're you're going to leave me i know you will disappoint me i know you will let me down i just don't even want anything to do with it your your not useful to me these are two different approaches to reacting to caregivers who are unable to meet a child's needs now the third type is a combination and this is the person who vacillates between i love you and i need to be around you and please don't leave me to go away and the anxious avoidant subtype is often prevalent in people who've experienced trauma they get angry they get overwhelmed and then they start to shut down and then because it's overwhelming they can't deal with you they become avoidant when they've gotten re-regulated then they start craving that closeness again they start fearing being alone again and they start the cycle again and this is a very common pattern in people who have complex ptsd and or borderline personality disorder what is addiction is the continued use of a substance or activity to escape numb or self-medicate emotional or physical pain despite problems in one or more areas of living as a result of use let's dissect that a little bit to escape when people drink alcohol or use other substances when people gamble they're often trying to escape life they're trying to get a break from it and focus their attention somewhere else numbing is another function of some substances because it just stops them from feeling for a little while and self-medication and this is what we see a lot with a lot of addictions and it's a little bit different than escaping or numbing because this the addiction itself is actually fulfilling a purpose of causing the brain to secrete neurotransmitters that the person is lacking to speak self-medication is using a substance because the person needs to feel less anxious it helps them feel connected may cause in codependency it may cause the secretion of dopamine and oxytocin which are chemicals in our body that prompt connectedness and closeness what is codependency describes a type of relationship in which one partner defines their worth or goodness as a relationship is based on someone else i am good as long as i am a good mother as long as i am a good spouse as long as i am a good whatever then i am as long as i am and 's such and such i am i'm not if i'm just me i don't know who i am the person often chooses relationships in which the other person needs to be rescued if i get into a relationship with somebody who needs to be rescued who needs to be taken care of there's a lot less chance that they are going to abandon me therefore and they need me and that need is shown through gratitude sometimes but that when that person responds in a positive way to me caretaking them it causes the release of dopamine oxytocin serotonin all a bunch אנилňños嘰ŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠŠ relationships where you need to caretake somebody negative control because you're determining someone else's reality for your own comfort you are telling them what they should do you are shaping their world in order to make you look good now in addiction we're going to start looking at codependent relationships as an addictive behavior in an addiction there's the possibility of developing tolerance needing more of the same substance or activity in order to get the same feeling and in a codependent relationship as time passes the person's identity becomes increasingly defined by the relationship with the other person when you first meet your future spouse you are two relatively independent people but as the person with codependency spends time with the with their partner they slowly start to morph and somewhat merge to become almost a an offshoot of that person they are no longer Sally they are Joe's wife withdrawal means not getting the substance not getting the substance or being around the person results in physical or psychological distress when apart from or unable to control the other person the person with codependency experiences extreme anxiety and depression they got into a relationship with somebody who they knew needed them and they in order to feel they're in order to feel they're safe in order to feel they are not going to be abandoned they need to be needed if that Otherwise person doesn't need them then they start becoming terrifying and pequeño of rejection and abandonment.",

    "output": "They were loved for how they look, who they knew, or what they did. they grew up in environments that were highly critical. And they grew up into adults who are constantly flaunting this. , don't look behind the curtain because I'm not lovable for who I am. But look at all these things that I do. Look at how wonderful I am. See, this is why I'm worthy of love instead of believing that they're worthy of love. grandiosity sometimes can be a way of veiling or protecting a person with low self-esteem. How does that come from insecure attachment. , the characteristics of insecure, of secure attachment are consistency. , the caregiver is there. If the child needs them, the caregiver's there. And it's not, , maybe the caregiver will show up. They're consistent. And if the caregiver themselves can't be there, they make sure that somebody else who can meet that need is there. There's a surrogate. And I recognize that many families, parents work long hours, sometimes two jobs, and they have babysitters or daycare or something else that, where there's a surrogate in place. And that's fine. As long as there is a caregiver there that is going to meet the child's needs. As long as the child trusts that where my primary caregiver puts me, , if it's daycare or school or grandma's house or wherever, it's going to be a safe place. consistency. Being consistent, being there, is only half of the battle. Responsiveness is the next part. The caregiver needs to be able to respond to the child's needs. If they're hungry, if they're cold, if they're scared, if they're angry, respond in a developmentally appropriate way to help the child cope with whatever's going on, to help them feel safe and not completely overwhelmed. The next part of secure attachment is attention. And attention is not just being responsive. Responsive is, in this mnemonic, is being there when the child is feeling distress. Attention is proactive time spent with the child saying, I value you as a person. I'm curious about what you're interested in. I want to spend time with you. Not because I have to, because I want to. And in many cases, children don't get this from their caregivers. Their caregivers do the very best to put food on the table or roof over their head.",

    "output": "And if that doesn't happen, if the caregiver is too exhausted, too overwhelmed, too depressed, too drunk, then the child starts wondering, , what's wrong with me. Why doesn't my caregiver want to spend time with me. I can't trust my caregiver to be there for me. All of these things negatively impact self-esteem. A need for validation and admiration by other people is often a side effect of a low self-esteem because the person can't look in the mirror and go, I am a person of value. They look in the mirror and go, I hope somebody will love me. I hope somebody sees that I can be useful to them in some way. And that's a very different perspective. they are needing other people to validate them and say, what, you are useful. I do need you in order to feel about themselves. People who are codependent often value other people's approval of their thinking, feelings, and behaviors over their own. what do I mean by that. I mean people who have codependency very often are chameleons. Instead of saying, these are my opinions, they say, , your opinions are more important than mine. You're more than I am. whatever I think must be wrong and I am going to cherish and value your opinion and put you up on this pedestal. How does that stem from or how can that stem from insecure attachment. , in those initial relationships, if the child or person learned to appease their caregiver, learned that, , things can go , I can be safe, and I might even get a little bit of attention. If I shower my caregiver with praise and I don't disagree and I don't argue, then guess what. They're going to continue to do that in adult life in order to, to avoid abandonment. Poor boundaries. And we see this and this kind of goes back to the anxious or avoidant attachment style. But poor boundaries are also a characteristic of codependency. When people feel terrified, they may have no boundaries at all. If they feel terrified of abandonment, they may say, I have no boundaries at all. You tell me what to think. You tell me how to feel. You tell me whatever you want as long as you don't leave me.",

    "output": "Or they may shut off completely and say, this hurts now and I can't trust you, you need to go away. And it's important to remember that people who've experienced trauma as children who didn't learn how to cope with emotions are often walking this tightrope where they never really feel safe. And any misstep, they feel they're going to fall. they're treading lightly on this tightrope, but if they start to fall, then they are going to react really strongly, oftentimes pushing other people away. But sometimes bringing them, doing things to try to bring them closer or guilt them or shame them into coming back. Now, how can these be addictive thoughts. , we all have addictive behaviors as. As I mentioned, a lot of times codependency or codependent behaviors prompt a surge of norepinephrine and adrenaline, which gives us energy, dopamine, as oxytocin. And all of those chemicals kind of combine into this feel-good soup where the person with codependency may, for a moment, feel even maybe good. And this is kind of at the heart of addictions where people are using a substance or activity to try to get those neurotransmitters to flow. They're trying to feel better and they don't know any other way to do it. People with addictions as codependency often are terrified of abandonment. And , they're trying to get rid of it. And , they are terrified of abandonment. And I've talked about that a bunch of times. And when people experience abandonment anxiety, there are four typical reactions. Fight, flee, fawn, or freeze. , let's look at fight first. In a codependent relationship, when someone starts feeling they're going to be abandoned, they may start becoming more critical, more angry, more agitated, more controlling of the other person. That's the fight. That's the fight mechanism. , I'll get you back in line to make sure that you need me and you don't leave me. Flee is the opposite. And this is when the person with codependency says, I just, I don't know what to do with you anymore. And many times, flee is almost a passive aggressive behavior because in their mind, they're thinking, you can't live without me. , if I flee, then you're going to pursue me. You're going to chase me.",

    "input": "I'm struggling with treatment. Can you help me understand what's happening?",
    "output": "Fawn is when people start feeling anxious, feeling threatened that they're going to be abandoned or hurt in some way. They may fawn over the other person. I'll do whatever you want. Just please don't leave me. I'll change. I'll do it. , there's this period where they're trying to appease the other person instead of control them. And finally, freeze. In a codependent relationship, sometimes the person with codependency will just shut down. They don't know what to do this time. , they will shut down. They will wall off. And this is kind of similar to flee when a lot of times, people with codependency are thinking that the other person will come pursue them. But when they're in that freeze mode, they're shutting down and sometimes they just wall off because they're recognizing that this relationship is exhausting and they're terrified to let it go. And thinking of addiction. When somebody is thinking about going into treatment, they get to the point where they're sick and tired of being sick and tired, but they don't know how to stop. They don't have the tools to deal with life on life's terms because they got a lot of stuff that they don't know. They don't know what they got to deal with. , they just freeze kind of a deer in headlights going, oh crap, what do I do. How do I get out of this. The relationship, the codependent relationship often comforts and numbs that abandonment anxiety. If the person in the codependent relationship feels confident that the other person needs them, that the other person can't live without them, then, it helps them feel less anxious because they feel they've got that parental figure, caregiver figure that they never had that they can call on. They're never going to be alone. The relationship becomes the primary focus and they start minimizing, denying, and blaming other people to protect the relationship. They start making excuses for the other, and they start making excuses for the person's behavior, whether it's because they're calling in sick or they've spent through their kid's college account or they didn't show up to their kid's soccer game. Whatever it is that person is doing as a result of whatever's going on with them, their depression, their anxiety, their addiction.",

I'm going to deny it, or I'm going to blame. If you wouldn't be demanding on John, then, it wouldn't be overwhelming for him to come. , he can't come, but it's your fault that he can't come because you overwhelmed him. You wore him out. You triggered him to go use again. Stinking thinking becomes the norm. And this goes back to those cognitive problems. And again, this is a behavior we see in people with addictions a lot. Their life often becomes one of all or nothing. I'm loved or I'm hated. I'm safe or I'm not safe. , the rest of their thinking tends to become very polarized. And there's a lot of, every time I do this, this happens. Or you never do this. And stinking thinking is a cognitive reaction to threat. Remember I said when we feel stressed, when we're in a dysphoric mood, we tend to notice the threats and we tend to interpret or perceive things in the environment the most nefarious way possible. And that makes us feel even more unsafe in our environment, which promotes more anxiety, which promotes an even darker view of the world, people's intentions, etc. Stinking thinking is a big area for adjustment in a lot of people. And it's not just addictions. We see this in people with depression, anxiety, and anger too. People with codependency and to a certain degree, addiction many times, have difficulty identifying and expressing their reality. They grew up not having any models, not having anybody help them develop their emotional intelligence, their ability to identify and regulate their emotions. They never had anybody help them develop their communication skills and learn how to assertively state what they feel. And they never had anybody help them feel it was safe. They never had anybody validate them and say, what, it's safe to tell me your reality. I may not agree with it, but it's safe to tell me your reality and there's not going to be mega negative repercussions. for a lot of different reasons, people who are codependent often have difficulty even putting it, identifying or putting into words what they're experiencing.",

They didn't know how to regulate. They never learned how to regulate. They weren't in control of their parents. They couldn't get their parents to respond in nurturing ways. as adults, they are trying as hard as they can to create an environment that's safe. That's all they're doing. They're trying to create a sense of safety. They may have difficulty admitting mistakes. , mistakes mean you're wrong, and meaning you're wrong may mean rejection. that can be really threatening for anybody, let alone somebody with low self-esteem and fears of abandonment. They may be unable to identify or ask for what they need and want, and we talked about this a little bit earlier. And in treatment, it's really important to help people start understanding, , what is the function of this behavior when you try to control your significant other. What is the function of that. Why do you need to try to control them. Why, what is prompting this behavior. What would happen if you didn't. What does that feel , and where do those feelings come from. And how can we, what tools can you develop to cope with those feelings that are different than trying to control your significant other. When you're going through a day, and mindfulness is one of the first skills that I have a lot of people develop, whether they're recovering from addictions or depression or codependency, because it's important to be able to develop this secure attachment with yourself. Be consistent with yourself. , be there. Show up. Be mindful of, , checking in on what's going on. Be responsive to your needs. Once you've actually checked in and figured out what your needs are, be responsive. Validate your needs. Provide encouragement for yourself and create safety. When a person starts being able to do that for themselves, then they stop relying on others to do it for them. They stop being afraid of being abandoned and being helpless that little child was. A lot of people with codependency have trouble setting healthy priorities and boundaries because, again, they're afraid that if I set a boundary, I'll be rejected or I'll be abandoned. That they have these wide open boundaries. I'll do whatever you want.",

    "output": "Once the person has started to develop mindfulness and a secure relationship with themselves, starting to identify what their needs and wants are, then helping them learn how to communicate those wants and needs and set boundaries. If they don't have the energy to do something, how can they assertively communicate that. They may have difficulty making decisions and a lot of this is due to fear of making somebody else angry. They often grew up in environments where there wasn't anybody there to help them make decisions or figure out what the decision was. Simple decision making practice can also be helpful in figuring out the motivations. Are you making this decision because it's the decision for you or are you making this decision because you fear rejection, abandonment, criticism, whatever. People with codependency, when they do identify their needs, often demand that their needs are met by others because they can't meet their own needs. We're often seeing the emergence of the inner child that didn't have that primary secure attachment. The person is acting more a toddler than an adult. They're demanding that their needs be met because they think, maybe if I demand, then this will work for me. Maybe if I demand that you do whatever I tell you to do, controlling, then you won't abandon me. Then I'll get my needs met. Then I'll be safe. A lot of times people who are codependent believe that others are incapable of self-care. They've convinced themselves of this because if they believe that their significant other is capable of self-care, then their significant other may not need them. In my mind, if I'm codependent, I need to believe that this person can't do it on their own and they need me. Back to that insecure attachment again. As children, they were incapable of self-care. They're projecting that wounded inner child that's incapable of self-care, they're projecting that onto their significant others. They're trying to nurture, sometimes, they may be trying to nurture that wounded inner child via trying to nurture the person they're in a relationship with. They may try to convince others what to think or feel and often offer unsolicited advice and direction. Again, going back, how is this a replication or a manifestation of what the child went through because of their insecure attachment. They may have wanted advice when they were younger.",

No. They're just going to shift gears. And that's what we're going to talk about today. , the second sign is there are subtle boundary tests. Look, they sense that their power is slipping. , what they do is they start pushing just enough to see if you're going to react. They know what your boundaries have been before. And now they're also sensing that those boundaries have probably gotten firmer. , they likely pull back a little bit. They readjust. They kind of recalculate. It's an enemy attack. If I'm getting slaughtered and somebody recognizes now what my tactics are, I'm going to go back to home base and I'm going to reassess. , what they're doing is they're going back and they're starting to reassess. , what they're doing is they're going back and they're starting to reassess. , what they're doing is they're going back and they're starting to reassess. , what they're doing is they're going back and they're starting to reassess.

If you're dealing with a severely immature narcissist, they'll just lash out a little child. But once you continue to hold firm, now they're going to pull back and they're going to reassess. , they'll start coming back with just those subtle little boundary tests. Maybe it's a quieter manipulation. Maybe it's a softer guilt trip. But make no mistake about it. They're going to be subtle in their testings. The third is sudden role changes. Now, wait for this one. , if they were controlling before, now they're playing the victim. If they were selfish before, , suddenly now they're just giving.

After all I've done for you, I was there for you when you needed me and this is how you treat me. One of the things they love to do is to put you on the defensive. They love to pull that debt card, attacking your character, your intention, your motives, all while playing the victim. And they do this to put you in a position to feel you have to now prove yourself to them or earn their trust back. Yes, even though they're the ones who broke yours. And as cunning as it is and as real as it feels, the motive is always going to be the same here. It is guilt. It is self-serving. And we go back to number three from before, the sudden role changes. They're going to take these guilt trips and first of all, they're actually pretty lazy people. They're going to try the old guilt trips. Now, when they stop working, they will start to refine their guilt trip because you've left them no other choice. , make no mistake. Just because you put a boundary down or you say no, does not mean this person is changing. Even if you see changed behavior, if it comes without repentance, it comes without repair, my friend, that changed behavior is just going to be temporary at best.",

But they do not want to do any repenting, any repairing. And they certainly don't want to walk down the journey. They don't want to walk down the journey of a healthy relationship. They just want things to go back to the way they were. you're likely going to discover that if you fall for the hoovering, things go back to the way they were. And then they start getting upset with you again because you're not tolerating the behaviors anymore. My friend, narcissists feel every shift in your emotions. They're going to feel every shift in your reactions. Don't underestimate them. This is their life skill. They have been assessing and evaluating people likely their entire lives. Because they're looking to do whatever they can to get their needs met. they're going to surround themselves with people who give them what they want and need. They're going to surround themselves with people who don't challenge them and think that they're just wonderful and all that. they are going to quickly see. They're going to sense a shift in your emotions and reactions. Please don't think for a second that you're going to be able to get over on a narcissist.

And I don't mean we go from one day I'm tolerating everything about them to now the next day there's complete no contact. What I'm saying is you have to develop your healthy boundaries. Something that you are comfortable with. And then stand firm in that. No manipulation. No guilt trip. Nothing to break you out of that firm stance. The only thing that should cause your boundaries to change. I don't want to call it weaken. But you can change boundaries.

Doesn't mean that has to be forever. It might be for a reason and a season. But by the same token, you want to be very careful that just because somebody has fake empathy or they start hoovering or they start saying everything that you've been hoping they're going to say for the past 25 years. That now everything's changed. And your boundaries change. And your boundaries should loosen. Your boundaries should loosen or change only based upon repeated longer term behavior. And then if and when that behavior goes back to being inappropriate again, then that boundary needs to get locked down once again. you got to be consistent in those boundaries. Boundaries are not just a matter of saying no. They are. They are an evaluation for each individual person and each individual situation or a group of scenarios. for example, I don't tolerate being yelled at. if somebody's yelling or screaming at me, I will end a conversation. I will leave the room. I'll give ample notice saying I want to have a respectful conversation. But I am not going to be yelled at. And if you continue to yell, I'm now going to take myself out of here. And we can resume this conversation when you're ready to talk respectfully. that's my boundary. And if somebody continues to do that but then insisting, oh, this is just the way I talk. Oh, this is just the way I am. Or oh, , you started this. You can't engage in that because now you've just given in to the guilt and the manipulation. You've got to stand consistent with your boundaries. Number two. Is calling out lies. Too bluntly, too arrogantly. My friend, if you're going to call out lies, which I'm not saying that you shouldn't, you want to do it with caution.

I'm talking about internal boundaries too. My internal boundary says I am not going to get triggered when they say X, Y, Z. My internal boundary says I'm going to do this instead of that. Or I'm going to withdraw instead of snapping back. That is dealing with boundaries appropriately. And that is actually consistently being able to call out the lies in love. be careful that you're not triggering them. Again, I'm going to backtrack. You're not responsible for how they react. You're not responsible for how they respond. But let's face it. If we start cursing at somebody, blaming them, acting defensively, yes, they are responsible for their response.

    "output": "By the way, if you want help assessing the level of risk you're dealing with, I've created a free narcissist protection checklist, and it's quick and powerful, and it's in the description below. A narcissist is always checking to see if they can press a button and make you change your behavior. To test your time boundaries, they'll wait until you set a small one, you say you're heading out, or you're going to bed early, or you've gotten time off next week. Then they press, maybe with guilt, maybe with excuses, maybe with passive aggression, and they watch. They're not testing what you say. They're testing what you do. If you shift your schedule, delay your exit, or give in to the guilt, they learn something, that you're someone whose time can be taken. To see if they can take your attention, the process is kind of the same. They push buttons to capture your focus. The setup is simple. You're already focused on something else, you're in a conversation, or a meeting, watching something, reading, thinking, and that's when they strike. They might try to text you while you're busy, or follow up again if you don't answer fast enough. They might pop over unannounced, and expect you to stop what you're doing. They might just cut in on a conversation, stand in your line of sight, or talk over what you're watching. And then they watch to see if you're gonna drop what you're doing, to see if you're easy to pull towards them. If they can break your focus once, they're gonna do it again, and it will escalate. To see if they can feed on your energy, they set up a trap, and then watch what you do. The setup is subtle, but deliberate. They forget something important, or they act helpless, or they bait you in with drama. They stir up guilt, conflict, or pity, just to see how fast you step in. And then they watch, to see if you're gonna protect your energy, or if you're going to hand it to them. If you take responsibility for their mess, if you jump in to calm them down, if you explain, or soothe, or carry what isn't yours, they know you're now a source.",

    "output": "When you don't want someone crossing a line around your time, attention, or energy, the key is to say no with behavior. What does that mean. It means your actions must match your words. You hold your position, and then you wait. It's not the boundary violation that tells you who people are. People with trauma, neurodivergence, or people-pleasing habits might cross a line too, but they're usually trying to connect, even if it's clumsy. Others might just feel disappointed or surprised, but they recalibrate and move on. A narcissist, though, you're gonna see it. You're gonna see a flash of irritation, a smirk that immediately drops, a sudden edge in their tone, sarcasm, guilt, or silence. They shift tactics. That's your cue. They weren't making a request. They were checking for power. A narcissist crosses the line to dominate, to win, and when they don't get what they want, they escalate, because it was never about the boundary. It was about seeing if they could bend your behavior, and if they succeed, even once, they're gonna be back. Let me give you an example. Let's say it's your time, and you've made it clear that you're done for the day, and you're dealing with this person that you're trying to check if they're a narcissist or not. You're packing up, you're heading out, and that person stops you, saying, wait, before you go, can you help me with one quick thing. Caveat to this, not everybody that needs to interrupt you is going to be a narcissist. I'm imagining that you guys are in this situation. You understand the difference between a person who does this all the time. You feel manipulated, you're checking this, and a person who's just accidentally bumbling along and asks for help, because the point isn't to always say no. It's to say no selectively, and then watch what happens when you do it. You tell them, I've gotta run, or I said, I have to leave, or I said, I have an appointment, or whatever it is, and then the boundary isn't what you said, it's what you do at that point. You leave, you don't explain, you don't stall, you just keep going. That's your no, not the words. And then you need to watch.",

Or wow, , I guess I just figured it out myself. that is passive aggression. That's when you need to stop and ask yourself, are they just asking for help, or are they testing to see if I'm gonna yield. Because that moment tells you everything. If it happens once, it might just be frustration or a bad day, but if you keep seeing it happen, if your exits are followed by guilt or fallout or pressure, you're not in a misunderstanding, you're in a power play. Now let's say it's your attention, you're in a conversation, working or watching something, you're focused and someone asks, hey, can I ask you something real quick. And you respond politely, sure, give me a second. Then you stay engaged in whatever you're doing. That is your no, delivered through your behavior. And then you watch. If they wait, great, but if they try to talk over you or act offended or hijack the moment, they're not reacting to the moment, they're reacting to the resistance. They're trying to override your position, to your position that's giving you the upper hand. Now let's say it's your energy they're after. There are just a few minutes left in a Zoom call and you're wrapping it up and people are saying goodbye and that's when they drop it. I mean, not that anyone really cares, but I cried in the bathroom for an hour this morning. Silence. This isn't someone asking for support because when someone truly needs care, they don't wait till the final moment of a meeting when no one has time or energy to help them, but this is a super common narcissistic tactic. They wait until the exit and then they drop something heavy to force emotional investment. here's how you test it. In that moment, you don't dive in. You don't reopen the conversation. You just hold the line politely. You can nod or say something nice to them , I'm sorry you're going through that. But then you close the meeting as planned. Again, this is about your behavior. It's about your action ending the meeting. That's your no. Calm, clear, behavioral.",

That's the intimacy piece around perception. Who out there gets triggered to things what did you mean by that. She just simply said hey buddy. It's Wednesday and you're not dumb. But I took it as hey, you're dumb. there's a lot of leftover subconscious stuff from the narcissistic parent that gets in the way of our intimacy. What shifted everything for me. Was the work about what I'm about to talk about with you. The truth is my father didn't know me in any way due to his need of being superior. And he thought he was giving me good advice when he was actually just abusing my perception of my abilities. To the point that I had no sense of self.

    "output": "Here are six common pitfalls that I've seen clients get into over the years, which makes their healing process either stall out completely, or it just makes their process a lot more messy or mucky than it really has to be. Healing childhood trauma is really already hard enough. And incidentally, even if just one of these six ideas stick in your mind, then it's a totally a win for me, whether you're kind of envisioning something happening down the road or just to keep yourself aware. And healing is a subjective idea. It's really different for everyone, but there are some key factors in it that I'll discuss towards later in the video. And I think if you're watching these videos or you're already in a process, whether that process is you're already going to therapy or you're doing some self-healing work, if therapy doesn't work out for you or if it's not really available, or you might actually be getting ready to do something in the future. I think a lot of people watch these videos to start off with in kind of revving themselves up to do some work in some way that works best for you. watching videos this is part of a process, but it can't be the whole thing. Eventually, we need more. Through my own process, I fell into many of these pitfalls, if not all of them. These are actually really common for childhood trauma. And the more , the more you can be kind of prepared to avoid. And I want you to pause here and hear what I have to say. Some of these might really challenge you when you're thinking about your own healing. Or you might find yourself a little bit defensive in this video, especially with this first one. let's just dive into it. Number one is confusing awareness for healing. You might find yourself a little bit called out on this one. And I remember my mentor, Amanda Curtin, L-I-C-S-W, my mentor, in my first group with her 20 some odd years ago, 20 plus years ago. She would tell us, awareness doesn't really change you. This is a highly common thing for those starting out and for those who haven't had access to therapy, the kind of therapy that turns you into a puddle of grief on the floor, which is actually a good thing.",

What about how we still might project onto others, our toxic parents or our trauma story or are doing that projecting onto friends, partners, and bosses, or even onto ourselves. And even the way we might either make ourselves super reactive, we don't make ourselves super reactive or we get super reactive, or we might make ourselves really small and people please all the, all the memes in the world about people pleasing might not get you to be able to heal and stop those behaviors. that's what this pitfall is all about. And when we think we're all set because we're aware of our issues, it's kind of a big setup when the mess comes back into our life and our trauma is again, mucking up our present lives. I'm not saying that awareness is pointless. It's actually an incredible thing, but it's just the beginning of healing. It's not the whole thing. But I also need to address that because there is such a lack of resources for many people and lack of good therapy. And lack of deeply changing experiences in therapy, that it's kind of in a common assumption to think that we've got it all figured out because we've read the things for simply not having those. It was , we don't know what we don't know. I want to be kind of fair about that, but this will make more sense when you think about it this way. How many self-help books have we read that were amazing, but didn't create lasting significant change in you. , many have gotten frustrated. I'm frustrated even with my social media posts and the posts of others and other therapist creators. When we offer psychoeducation and you kind of leave comments that are , , but now what, what do I do. How do I fix the thing. What's the, what's going on. You're just telling me about stuff. Social media isn't therapy. It's education. , therapy is therapy. And while I a thousand percent understand that it's not fully available or affordable or a lack of trained people.

That is sort of a healing mindset. You're not willing to kind of just make yourself the sacrificial lamb anymore. In short, the pitfall here is healing won't make you bulletproof. Inner children think they have the power to not have things affect them. It's an old magical thinking. That's why we'll often take on, say, extremely hard jobs or take on extremely difficult, messy partners, and then we're surprised when it actually affects us. You'll know what I mean if you have that kind of going on. Moving on to number three is something that I'm calling discouragement confirmation. This one is simply about discouragement as a barrier to your healing. Please don't take this as criticism or a reflection of who you are. Again, I'm painfully aware of how terrible access to mental health services are, and I really want to be able to change that, or the lack of trained clinicians. I'm actually working on that, or even finding a therapist where the fit is. I'm very much aware of that. it's easy to get discouraged, and it's actually a normal part of the process when it comes to finding the resources for yourself. You can have a good therapist and good treatment, and you can still really get discouraged by the process. But this pitfall is really about how your inner child interprets that messy, frustrating process. And the pitfall here is when you're trying to get an appointment, when you're trying to get into a group, signing up for something that doesn't pan out can cause a trauma reaction of wanting to give up. It's very understandable. However, the reaction is a lot the inner child saying, see, why do I even start with this crap. Nothing ever pans out for me. It's always this for me. This is something we can actually reparent ourselves around as it's kind of something that keeps us stuck in the face of huge adversary. How many times have you started to try to do trauma, have it not work out, and then you don't try again for years. I'm not just saying in no way am I saying it's all you on this.",

As a side note, gradually getting through to a partner gently is different, I think, than trying to kind of sell them because you're jazzed up about it. But it's really about your energy on this one. It's about our agenda. Telling your entire circle that they're probably all suffering from childhood trauma because you've gone to therapy and read all the things isn't that great. It's actually a pitfall. But encouraging, say, a partner to look at their family system in therapy because they don't really do great conflict or they fawn or they fight too much, that's a different thing. I want to be clear about that. That's more about intimacy and boundaries as opposed to selling something. That's more about a direct. Direct kind of intimacy problem. this can get a bit dangerous. Think of all the people who think they have the answer to society's woes and want everyone to be on the same page. That's kind of gets a little bit scary,. I don't even it when someone tells me they discovered hot yoga and I absolutely need to do it every day because it'll change my life. They're probably not wrong, but I'm , oh, chill,. I actually believe that childhood trauma is the root issue to society. I'm not going to force that on anyone who doesn't want to hear it or they're not interested or they're not ready. There's enough of that going on in the world. Number five is wrong place, wrong therapy, wrong time. This pitfall is tricky. Childhood trauma work and trauma work in general when it's good is exhausting at times. Not 24-7, but cathartic releases and grief work about our family systems takes up a lot of energy. A lot of head space and a lot of rest is needed. I want to encourage you to do that. If you're new to therapy or new to realizing you've gone through childhood trauma, you really don't know what to expect. You don't know what you don't know.

If you are two weeks away from taking a nursing exam or the bar exam, or you're in the middle of a divorce, I mentioned, it's not a good time maybe to dive into hardcore trauma and you'll need some support. And as a side note, , the beginning, it's not you're gonna dive into the first couple weeks with a trauma therapist into some hard, really hard nitty gritty, hopefully. There's usually a slow windup, but I think that these still apply in terms of what's going on in your life. A good therapist would read that you, and maybe wanna slow things down, but I think many survivors are maybe impatient to get things going. they've had a therapist before who didn't wanna go there, the clients are really raring to go, but their present life is kind of on fire. And I know it's frustrating, but having too much going on in the present makes diving into our past super nonproductive, I think.

It's a little bit of a staring game sometimes. And yes, it's crazy, but sometimes therapists are waiting for clients to figure it out. And I totally disagree with that. And I know that's frustrating. On the other side of it, many survivors need a type of therapy and maybe a precursor to delving into some childhood trauma work. No one really that idea, but some people need a lot of help with regulating emotions before they open up their childhood. You might need some time with CBT or DBT or mindfulness or somatic work to set you up for more success. Sometimes people just need to be comfortable with a therapist in the room for a long time because trauma is relationally damaging. I hope that makes sense. I know it's frustrating, but things do need to be in alignment. the stars are in alignment, not perfect, but to be thoughtful if this is the time for you, if you have the resource, the head space, the calmness in your present life to bring on something doing that work. As a side note, I'm not trying to scare anybody. All clients are gonna have a hard time in the beginning of trauma work and they're gonna have to act, they acclimate, they acclimate really. But I've also had clients who have had to leave prematurely because they just have way too much going on or they need something else or the trauma work is too activating and we've paused and talked about it and they might need some time in CBT or something that, especially if they're totally new to therapy. They were earnest, they were gun-ho, but it just wasn't at the time, the resource, the place for them despite the miracle of it. And I think that's the big thing that's important to remember.",

I feel better, the issue must not be an issue anymore. It's a matter of time before we can really kind of check that thinking. It's when we were seven, and there would be a horrific weekend or a horrific birthday party with a toxic parent. But then three or four days down the road by Tuesday, things have kind of died down. We're back to the status quo. Maybe even the parent is in that rare good mood. And the child lives from moment to moment, and they're just , oh, , now things are great. it's really an inner child kind of experience, I think, with this one. There's a bit of magical thinking that the huge issues have now gone away when they're just going to come back later, unfortunately.

You've bought a course. You've started the course. You're having some kind of experience, and things are kind of hitting you. But then you're leaving with it only partially complete.

Try to be mindful about what story is in your mind. What story does your inner child have about maybe leaving before bigger work is being done. Is it a story that's later for that. Or I don't really want to feel this bad stuff, to be honest. Or I'll come back to it at some point. Or not wanting to go there. Or putting my cursedANmade video down.",

    "output": "It's I need to be secure in this one area before I move into this next thing. Security can also look intimacy and social problems, not being comfortable being seen or not being comfortable being known. Another example is living in fear mostly as opposed to living and having some spontaneity in life. All of those are examples of security issues. I think it's a good idea to have that kind of a blankie, issues in my mind. And these security issues, I'm not trying to say they're solely related to blankies or stuffed animals or sucking our thumb. They're really related to children not having a safe home base and a healthy parent from which they can also kind of, , they can always return to, they can always talk with and feel more secure. That's where the security stuff really comes from. And it's difficult to see peers move more freely in the world than we can. And they can maybe weather breakups better or job changes better. And they don't go much into their head about, say, planning or expectations from an insecure place. Security delays are greatly improved with inner child work. And it feels to the inner child, there's a new safe home base coming from our inner adult within that reparenting work. And that's a process of really rebuilding a relationship with our inner child. And I think whatever the healing modality is going on there, I think about it as a process of really rebuilding a relationship with our inner child. And I think whatever the healing modality is going on there, I think about it as a inner child work, especially with helping the inner child let go of something as you can picture, say, a monkey clinging to a branch or an animal clinging to a branch. And there's a deep, there's a big fall going on. They're hanging on for dear life. In inner child work, we need to help that inner child. We can't just demand that they let go of the thing that helps them feel secure, , , getting to places on time or whatever. We can't just take that away from them. We have to let them grab on to another branch. And that's what we're doing.",

That never really works. We have to replace it, something that the child can feel some trust in, and that is maybe the inner adult. Moving on to the next one, which is a big one, which is called perception problems delays. Problems of perception, i. e. how we interpret people in the world, how ourselves, this is really a top tier childhood trauma symptom of problems of perception. Growing up in abuse, often the abuse itself is a parent damaging a child's perception because the adults have all the power over reality, which is scary. Perception delays are not unlike seeing a preschool age child intensely assume that someone did something on purpose. Many adult childhood trauma survivors can get stuck still assuming things are done on purpose. Sometimes they are, but we can really see our peers not get bogged down in taking things personally, regardless if they are actually offended and someone is a jerk or an idiot or if someone is harmless. I hope that makes sense. Survivors, due to those perception delays, really get into fights in their head, and the offense, real or imagined, stays with them. And I'm saying this from experience here, where we perceive the person really having an issue with us or really making it about us, but it's probably about the other person. You've probably heard that before. It's not about the other person. It's about the other person. It's about the other person. It's about the other person. It's about the other person. But what's tricky about this is often in the toxic family system growing up, things were highly personal. Or if we're still engaged in that family system, they can be highly personal. it's tricky for survivors to embrace thinking differently about the world and not take things personally, but it is possible over time. Essentially, when we have a toxic parent, a child is whatever the parent says they are.",

Those are all perception issues that we can kind of absorb or react to or kind of reject. Survivors can, again, they can rebel against those or take them on. Both become extreme distortions of perception though, such as when a survivor never wants to seem they're superior to others for having a parent who lived in that in an immature and grandiose way. But that survivor might never be able to see that as a person. it's a very, very difficult thing to do. And I'm going to go ahead and wrap up here. I'm going to go ahead and wrap up here. I'm going to go ahead and wrap up here. I'm going to go ahead and wrap up here. I'm going to go ahead and wrap up here. Never really take themselves seriously and they will stay small. They'll be humble because if they perceive, they might kind of perceive that all self-positivity is grandiose unconsciously. I got this course called The Family Rules that I offer. Here are some additional examples of abusive perception coming from an abusive family system. These are unspoken or sometimes spoken family rules, such as it's your fault things go wrong. It's a problem of perception. Expect unreliability from people. Again, it's a problem of perception. It's a problem of perception. It was probably correct in childhood, but we might sort of overly think people are going to let us down. I know I did. Perception problem. Read my mind. Coming from the family system was a huge perception problem. Don't trust. Again, probably very true in childhood, but in our adulthoods, we can have a perception problems around who is trustworthy and who is not. In addition, while not in the family rules, from a toxic parent, there's usually you're a terrible kid and I can't believe you just did that. That's usually kind of a vibe around definitely abuse around perception, you're bad. But there's also kind of a developmental issue there is a toxic parent expects adult behavior from a child, which is, again, another perception problem and a developmental problem.",

And as adults, we can have a lot of shame and difficulty in our adult lives due to the fact that we're not able to do anything. We can have a lot of shame and difficulty in our adult lives due to not fully knowing that how much sleep we need to get or how to do a budget. We can also have a deep shame about, say, learning disabilities and delays that we had to hide, and we still believe we really can't meet those delays head on. In the third grade, I was in danger of being kept back for having problems with reading comprehension. And at the same time, I discovered that I loved comic books, and I started reading these comic books, which had less complex dialogue, and they had correlating pictures, that would help me understand what was going on more. And that's what actually proved my reading on my own. I was even keeping it all kind of secret. But that's what I mean. Also, developmental delays would also get you into trouble more if you talked about them. And later in therapy, I would really realize the level of neglect and the kind of help that I really kind of needed. , working on the functioning delays are very possible. From an inner child work perspective, our inner adult is often in need of a resource, to learn how to overcome some things, such as getting somewhere on time, or getting support from someone a therapist or fellow survivor who gets it. And by resources, YouTube, I love it. It's a good example, is, , if I went on YouTube, I can learn about budgeting. I can learn how to read more books instead of being on my phone all the time. I can learn how to contribute better to a conversation by being more an active listener.",

But often and I get this that people just want to know about how do I fix my present stuff, which I get to.

That's what a little kid is saying. How did it feel, though, to be the first one out in dodgeball or kickball when you were playing a game with other kids, say, in third or fourth grade. Games are learning and socialization. Yet they're vulnerable experiences for children. And I'm not saying that they're not. I'm not saying that they're not. I'm saying they all cause trauma. Although, , fourth grade dodgeball or team picking, when you were lined up to be picked on a team, certainly felt barbaric and kind of Lord of the Flies-. Lord of the Flies is a movie about kids getting stuck on a desert island fighting for dominance. If you already are upset, don't Google it. Don't YouTube it. Forget I said anything about it. Don't worry about it. It's pretty awful. Growing up, I would see more secure kids who, to me, had more secure home lives be able to dive into the world of sports. Be able to dive into those games or life more comfortably. , related to that, trauma is also about a child not being helped or prepared to manage the chutes and ladders in our lives. Helping them manage the rain about becoming a person that they're trying to do. Play is a way we're becoming somebody. The stakes are much higher for kids who aren't safe. Say a child is being physically hit at home by a parent about their natural upset to losing a game with their siblings. That happened to many of us growing up.",

We're not choosing to struggle with this stuff. it's not a moral problem. here are four different security categories in our adult lives and these are how I see them. This is my opinion. Others might have different takes on it. I'm going to get into these four emotional security issues. One is self-worth. Compared to others, which is important, which is our ability to maintain our worth in context of others. The next is receiving feedback. What is said and what we hear might be very different things. The third one is romantic attachment. It's our ability to stay connected to self and others. And lastly is something I'm calling emotional confidence. How much time do you lose to fear and anxiety and upset. And how do you deal with that. And sensitivity. in each category, I'm going to talk about what the insecurity issues specifically look in our adult lives. Next, I'm going to talk about how the insecurity issues come from potentially our childhood. And lastly, I'm going to be talking about potential healing, some specific interventions that you might or you might not. keep thinking about these in context of chutes and ladders for each one. Also, there's no way for me to cover or hit or explain the complexity of human insecurity in one video or emotional security. I'm going to do my best to go as deep into this topic as I can. But I'm just little old me on a planet with 8 billion of you. I'm not going to be able to cover everything is what I'm trying to say. here, let's dive into the first one, which is self-worth compared to others. What does self-worth insecurity look. It's really about feeling inadequate about our abilities or our goodness as a person. Again, think chutes and ladders, what we have compared to others in their career or in relationships.",

    "output": "It's not just about finding buried anger about the abusive parent, it's by grief work. I'm suggesting to find a therapist who gets the grief of losing connection and safety in childhood and groups that focus on childhood trauma also have a group component to them. Although it might not be specifically talked about as grief work, but when we're looking at our childhood and feeling it and processing it, that's gonna bring grief is what I'm trying to say. We all have to grieve the lies that we were kind of fed before we can discard them and rebuild our self-worth. Just doing it affirmations usually doesn't work or sink in without our childhood trauma being considered within that affirmation. you can look at the mirror every day and say I'm worth I'm a worthwhile lovable person, but it's more powerful to say I'm a worthwhile lovable person and my father was completely wrong about me. You see the difference in those two things. The other is to rebuild a new narrative about your worth notice that comes after processing your childhood trauma where your messages of work come from and what you lost in that. The second category is feedback. How we react to feedback, how it triggers us is one of our biggest clues into emotional insecurity. Really pay attention to what I'm about to say. Feedback is hard for anyone, I think, it's really human to be vulnerable, but the issue again with the childhood trauma stuff is HOW vulnerable, how sensitive, how sensitive is the topic that is deeply concerned to how significant, or how strong exactly is the nature of this topic and the ongoing issues that standeth among all. It's a critical fight every time one of these States than let it have just one How sensitive are we. Can we become less vulnerable in managing feedback. Another thing is that when I say feedback, I'm not talking about just a BS work performance review because those things are inhumane and ineffective and I hate them. I'm more talking about receiving information about yourself in many different forms. Here are some daily examples of feedback that we can react to as childhood trauma survivors. Say you're a parent and your toddler doesn't the spaghetti that you made and they say it's awful and that you're awful because they wanted chicken nuggies.",

    "output": "What is that for you as a childhood trauma survivor and a parent on a bad day. Another example is your dentist's office says that you didn't fill out the form completely and the person on the phone sounds a little irritated with you. Another is you haven't heard back from your friend about plans and they are really kind of hit and miss about communication you don't really know where you stand with them. Another is that second date you had was rescheduled and things aren't clear where that is going and you really them. Or maybe your really highly immature or abusive parent tells you that you've always been a problem and you're delusional about what happened to you if you approach them about the abuse or say the abuse from say their co-parent or something or step-parent. A big one is also who is it that you're getting feedback from. Getting feedback from say someone in authority figures can be really activating especially with a therapist or something that. Let's look at three different types of feedback that are typically complicated and how vulnerable might we get from these. The first is positive feedback. We tend to not believe people when they compliment us or we distrust their motives because the positivity and we might feel they've totally misread us and we're shocked and even feeling manipulated. Those are all very common things for childhood trauma survivors around positive feedback. Negative feedback which is really I think what we're all kind of anticipating as childhood trauma survivors mostly. Negative feedback is when we're feeling we're not good. It's you did this wrong kind of stuff. we tend to go into a really big or kind of mediumish trauma response around feedback. we might go into fawn mode or fight mode and we might really ruminate negative feedback and this is where we really take things personally in real or imagined situations. Then there's neutral feedback. Oddly and perhaps the worst kind of feedback can really drive us crazy because we're usually looking for the negative feedback due to our own behavior. Due to our hypervigilance and our shame. Neutral feedback feels the person is hiding their real feelings from us. we can feel someone is withholding and we can feel just tell me you don't the shirt and they actually don't have opinions about your shirt.",

    "output": "Another example is if we had a parent who constantly made comments aggressive or passive comments about how we looked how we did at school how we didn't brush our hair,. This can range from everything from verbal abuse to sarcasm about our ability to tie our shoes. In short, the constant negative feedback here was being put on the spot and attacked and affects all three categories of feedback being addressed as a little kid meant to be in trouble and we can take things really personally because it was personal growing up again. I know I keep saying that but I want to drive that point home. Weird one is having a parent who silently judged or was kind of miserable. they wouldn't outwardly say you're bad or you're not good at basketball or being messy with cereal, but they would definitely roll their eyes and then say it's fine. they lived in somewhat of an F my life kind of an energy kind of experience about being a parent. That really messes with believing people about positive feedback and neutral feedback and negative feedback and definitely worrying about what the person really thinks about us. Really another example is if we grow up with a highly mentally off or mentally ill parents someone struggling with really poor mental health who is both aggressive and twisted about reality children do not know what mental illness is. if someone is raised by someone struggling with an untreated personality disorder or thought disorder, or struggles with a mood disorder, the feedback can be highly attacking and confusing to kind of being disorganized in feedback later really becomes a mess in their adulthood. It's it's positive negative and neutral wrapped up in one chaotic mess and the parents problems with us usually becomes our identity without really having any choice in that. Also a big piece about feedback issues is the difference between what was said in what you hear. It's actually a wonderful thing to work. With our inner child around that. Have you ever been devastated by a work email and then you go back to read it later and it's really not that big of a thing. It's a good example of the inner child looking to confirm the chutes and ladders from our childhood trauma lens.",

It's how affirmations don't really last because our trauma belief system. Probably need some deeper help interpersonal group work is also what I suggest around the feedback with a good solid group therapist. The goal is about feedback can gradually be done in safety that takes a lot of strength building in the therapy world with individual and group therapist. I think most ruptures happen when feedback happens way too early or at the wrong time and interpersonal groups are about encouraging authenticity when I was practicing and I was running groups the model of therapy that we would do is that we wouldn't really get into hard. We would do is that we wouldn't really get into hard. Feedback exercises for at least a year into the work of weekly meetings and that feedback was really thinking about how a person's inner child in their inner adult are really connected with each other and there's some problems there we can actually heal our feedback issues and safe environments where we learn to not take our vulnerability seriously but working with childhood trauma is working with raw nerves to be honest. many people who don't have an experience of therapy or a group assume. It's all. Going to be negative feedback. It's kind of a funny assumption that people when I used to say would you want to join a group and they're why would I want to be attacked people fear or assume therapy is about being told we're wrong or we suck at things and the assumption tells a story about how we were raised our first group is actually our family. there's something there receiving positive feedback from a therapist or group is usually the hardest thing but because it also brings up a lot of grief about how what kind of feedback we got when we were kids. if you want to know a little bit about that.",

Inner subconscious, narrative or conscious actually and lastly for emotional confidence.

People don't want that really in general. I think. Unless you're difficult and abusive, but in addition, I'm someone who remembers my childhood very. And even as a little kid, I just remember being very unsure about the potential shoots even as early as kindergarten. why I use that analogy from that game is that healthy kids are vulnerable to things too because we're all battling baseline human shame and development and becoming a person biologically. It's a it's a biological task, but me. Not winning or keeping up with others would confirm the message that I was receiving at home such as you're not good enough.

They can grow into adults who can navigate and tolerate the shoots better not saying they're better people. I'm just saying they've had a more secure beginning to them. we have some work to do about really understanding our emotional security issues. And we also definitely have to become more self-compassionate to start to work on these interventions and I'll recap them here. One is understanding our history better. Another. Is holding abusive parents or neglectful parents accountable in finding healthy anger and have reclaiming our power. They're taking the blame and shame off of us and just really looking at the development piece and the interpersonal trauma. Another is taking healthy risk. Another is looking at therapy interventions if they're available to you strong suggestion about an interpersonal group. Another is understanding having a grief process that usually probably comes with that last one last suggestion about interpersonal group and establishing someone in your life that can be a healthy person. To bounce things off of for feedback issues. It's really not good to just kind of be in your head alone with them. Another is reparenting the inner child and establishing an inner secure connection with ourselves instead of seeking out that connection solely with others and you made it. You made it through this video. That was a lot. That was a lot of information. Thanks for hanging out with me and related to all this is I'm offering a lecture and a course on emotional security specifically around inner child work. You just follow the link up here and sign up for the live lecture which includes slides. Worksheets as the video lecture to replay whenever you want to it's a live event and then it becomes a course afterward and also FYI all my courses and lectures are available in my membership.",

    "output": "shame is an ever-present emotion within us and is usually the least understood in terms of our mental health, our triggers, even how we think. We often think when we're triggered or we're stuck, you might have a realization sometimes that's , this is just who I am,. And it most likely isn't just who you are. If you grew up in childhood trauma or relate to having PTSD or CPTSD, shame somewhere along in your history, mine, really got amped up to the point that we're used to it. And society is also pretty slow to understand things shame, it's not just you struggling with it. If we can understand shame as a basic human emotion, as how shame gets turned up and amplified in an abusive family system, which is what my work is about as an educator on childhood trauma, we can connect the dots and be less ruled by a lot of unnecessary intense shame that we experience. And it's really freeing to not be ruled by shame. And it's really freeing to not be ruled by shame. And it's really freeing to not be ruled by shame. And it's really freeing to not be ruled by shame. shame can be elusive and really normalized, again, in society and with ourselves, to the point that we don't intimately know it is shame, but we suffer from the lack of psychoeducation about it, which is what the video is about. And I'd you to consider to leave a comment now about what you think is one of your biggest sources of shame or shame issues, or how you get triggered to shame in the reaction, and kind of see if that what you're describing is going to pop up on this list later. You're probably also going to be helping somebody by naming the shame and leaving the comment. I think it would be great if we could just get by with much less shame, feel a healthy amount of shame about accidentally leaving some trash at a campsite or something, and not go to a shame hole or feel we're a terrible person or that we're solely responsible for dooming the planet.",

    "output": "That would be nice to just make it much smaller, to not wake up in the middle of the night, convinced that we're going to get fired, because we said a cringy bad pun at a work meeting that day. If you relate to that, you'll know what I mean. what is shame. I believe shame is relevant to everything about our mental health, attachment styles, people-pleasing fight responses, fond responses, how we cope, how we react. Shame is the liquid of a soup. It's the broth in which our childhood trauma issues and symptoms float around little alphabet pastas. And I know I totally just dated myself there. Here's what I mean. And I'll reframe this in terms of common triggers with CPTSD from childhood trauma. And yes, this looks silly, but just stay with me. Shame is the undercurrent. It's the vehicle. It's the fuel to many of these issues. Here's what I mean. We can say dissociate from making a social mistake, at a party or something, and then our early shame pops up and says that we're an idiot for saying something wasn't really that funny in a group or something, an intense shame reaction. We can have an anxious, preoccupied attachment style for not being loved or being seen by an aloof parent. And our early shame says that we're not worthwhile. We can be hypervigilant about being abandoned or being made fun of or teased because we can't tolerate the earlier shame of those things to be happening again in the present. Raise your hand out there if you are highly prickly to feedback. I'm not saying feedback is easy or a good time, but it might be the most intense way you get triggered. Feedback is a little bit of a not being good enough with our peers or in general and haven't yet connected that anxiety to the shame of, say, being neglected by an apathetic or unavailable parent. Or say we even had a golden child and we were able to get rid of that anxiety. We can be depressed about not having the to be with our child sibling and you got forgotten in that golden child kind of attention that they got.",

    "output": "what I'm trying to say with the soup analogy is there's usually an undercurrent of shame in all of our issues and it's important to be able to really dial into that shame, which is going to be very helpful in your journey of healing it. Here are some brief recap issues about shame. Here are some shame mechanisms and concepts to help further understand shame. Again, you might think you understand shame, but most people don't really understand. Shame versus guilt. In my experience, guilt is a gnawing feeling about being unable to remedy a situation or feeling you're failing others somehow, where shame automatically tells us we're inherently bad or a failure or not good enough. Childhood trauma coming from having abusive parents can involve what I call direct and indirect shame. Direct shame is we're being told that finger in our face, you're a bad kid. I can't believe you just did that. You're bad in various ways. Where indirect shame can be about feeling embarrassed about something a parent does or their character or the type of house that you grew up in because it's chaotic or messy. I did a video on this topic of direct and indirect shame that I'll put in the description for you. Another concept is full of shame or shameless. Childhood trauma greatly influences our shame, either acutely elevating it or we can really repress it greatly. Both have unwanted consequences in our lives and social life. we can't really repress it. We can't really repress it. We can't really find an extent to our public us. And put thatцевail because that's an everending nightmare. When we become aware that we are living in a Extra Time situation. There's a question that we definitely must correct, and that's, is it easy to fight off theson, type of shame. One of my favorite concepts to describe shame is shame being a fixed gravity thing. And a good analogy about shame is that shame is the main human emotion that other emotions orbit around, the sun and the solar system. It's the main entree to the emotional buffet here. For example, you might feel intense shame if something sad happens to you, but you quickly start to compare your situation that you're sad about to maybe someone who has it worse. That's kind of a stuck thing with childhood trauma.",

    "input": "What should someone know about shame and how it affects their relationships and healing?",
    "output": "The sadness that you're experiencing is in a fixed relationship to shame, which is the sun in this analogy, and it can't escape the orbit of shame or the sun. And being -sized or embracing your own sadness is being judged by your shame. Another example of the orbit thing is curiosity. You might be curious about doing some art or music or be curious about what might it be to do a creative project and be a creative person. But the shame, which again is the sun in this analogy, is a fixed relationship to shame. And it can't escape the orbit of shame or the sun. Another example of the orbit thing is curiosity. You might be curious about doing some art or music or be curious about doing some art or music. And it can't escape the orbit of shame or the sun. And keeps that curiosity planet in a fixed, locked orbit, that curiosity can't fly off and explore itself. that's what I mean about gravity, where other emotions and other things that we might want to do or experience is stuck in this fixed orbit with shame, this fixed gravity. Moving on, that shame can influence everything about us, our purchases, to what we eat, to our social life, how we make our money, what kind of sex life do we have, what kind of sex do we. There can be shame under current circumstances, but there can be shame under current circumstances, and there can be shame under current circumstances, and there can be through all of that. Do you sometimes feel bad about what you eat, what you buy. And this is one of those consistent thoughts that involve shoulds. I should eat more organically. I shouldn't this kind of sex. I should never call in sick ever. I shouldn't buy these silly things. It's a daily undercurrent thing that we need to dial into. Moving on, there's also shame in society rules. We can view shame as a good, , innate biological defense to be able to maintain our social status for our need to survive. Things go smoother socially in our lives if we're not doing shameful or antisocial hurtful things where we're cast out of groups, which is what we need to kind of survive.",

    "output": "Healthy shame, when it works, keeps us from being cast out of society by doing extreme hurtful acts. It would be cool if that's all that shame was, thinking about morality or being conscientious. It would be great if our shame didn't go to such an acute and overwhelming over-the-top place and was just there to remind us that we should be able to do something about it. Thank you. us to treat people the way that we wanted to be treated. Shame is also a big umbrella term. It also means things being mortified, being embarrassed, feeling less than, ridiculed, indignity, which I'll talk about later, feeling humiliated, feeling found out or exposed, both from real situations or just things that we assume in our heads about how people might see us or how we might be being treated. Another shame-based concept is when we have a very shame-based parent. This is a big piece to all of these issues is when we're being raised by a parent who has also marinated in shame their whole life where they react deeply and intensely to what they perceive to be mistakes or how things look. a neurotic shame-based parent not in touch with their childhood trauma might freak out if you miss a day at school because missing things is a reflection upon the family and upon them and it's just something bad that they can't name is going to happen if you miss it. now let's talk about what is the opposite of shame. When I discuss shame, I to add its opposite, which I believe to be the word integrity. Whether we're two years old or 80 years old, I think that humans feel good if they're seen as having integrity. it bothers us when we don't. Integrity and dignity can be taken away in childhood trauma if we envision the heartbreaking scenario of say a three-year-old toddler being screamed at because they had a bathroom accident. Really, really bad. I think it's a good idea to think about that. Really intense direct shame. While it's slow around this idea of dignity and integrity, I believe that people are parenting children these days more from the idea of protecting their children from being shamed too much. Mistakes are just mistakes and there's still love there.",

    "output": "Healthy parenting is about when we understand that children are already vulnerable to shame and our job is to protect them from experiencing too much shame. Too much shame is where the damage comes in. That's an analogy about screaming at a toddler, for having an accident. That's the stuff that stays with us. Even if parenting is extremely triggering and extremely stressful, but we still understand that we can't shame them too much. We still need to bring a lot of love and acceptance there. And I think that if we can help our kids maintain some power and some goodness and see their humanity, that's the shield that protects us from childhood trauma. As we work on ourselves, we kind of reclaim these ideas and have a good foundation that we're a good person. And being a good person, we're not going to be a good person. We're going to be a good person. We're going to be a good person. We're going to be a good person. What's coming at us is to have some dignity, to have some integrity. And we have some power in being a good person. We have goodness in being a good person. We have our humanity there, where we're to be human and make mistakes. Good enough healing I think is when we don't lose our power and we're able to have, to maintain our goodness. We're able to maintain and see our own humanity, even if we make mistakes or something comes up. That's a big difference. here are some real life examples of shame to help survivors become more familiar with how the emotion works in us and manifests within us from the context of our childhood trauma. These are everyday real life examples of how shame reveals ourself to us. And keep thinking about how unnecessary or intense or maybe a bit over the top these are. I'm not judging you in that. I'm just saying if you grew up in childhood trauma, you were most likely set up to struggle with shame in an intense and unnecessary way I was. I'll briefly name how the issue can come from childhood trauma. And I'll also try to give you an idea about what each example would look if there was more healing taking place around the issue.",

    "output": "And I'm gonna be listing these from less severe to more severe. Number one is when we say, oh, you too. And this is a light example of shame where we're somewhere an airport and we interact with someone who works there and tells us have a good trip and we respond with you too. It's pretty funny, it's pretty innocent, but depending upon the severity of someone's shame-based childhood trauma, we can really perseverate on that funny little mistake. Why is it shame. And it's pretty normal,. It's definitely normal, but mistakes are normal, but excessive shame really turns that up. And we walk away from that interaction really starting to feel terrible. Shame will manifest here by telling us that we're an idiot while we're walking away. And it can be worse if we tend to be unconsciously hypervigilant about trying to not be seen as an F-up. And not being seen an F-up is really a big one for childhood trauma survivors. It was for me. Maybe I'm just more out with it now that I embrace my F-up qualities. After we say you too, we might have a mini shame attack about something that is really just kind of a funny cliche. Our inner child can go to a place that I can't even pull off trying to seem a normal person. And that's a really big, intense shame-based thought. This shame example can come from your childhood as having a strategy of having to hide. Having to hide how we feel about ourselves, having to hide what goes on at home, having to hide being told that we're a terrible kid. we can go into schools as little kids and try to just pretend to be perfect. And then when something a mistake, a simple innocent mistake this comes up, we can feel exposed and I can't even keep it together kind of a thing. Healing the shame on a deeper level with this one can just being able to see the humor in making a mistake and feeling that you're terrible somehow. Healing is also going to allowing ourselves the grace, the sense of being perfect, the sense of being human. And that's what I mean by the humanity. And that's what I mean by the humanity. And that's what I mean by the humanity. And that's what I mean by the humanity.",

    "output": "Number two related to that is bomb jokes. When we're trying to be visible or funny and that fails. If I made a joke in a meeting and it bombed, I would experience a deep physical sensation of shame, a shame attack. And I would dissociate while hating myself for just taking the risk that I just took by telling a joke. my energy in my body would drop down, my energy in my body would drop down, my energy in my body would drop down, to my feet and I would want to crawl into the woodwork to escape. It's awful. And the childhood trauma in this example could involve experiencing abuse where taking a risk inside your family, making a joke or asking a question could get you attacked. Expressing yourself could have immense contempt aimed at you and your family. It can also be trying to be funny and be liked, which is really a common thing for childhood trauma survivors. And being funny isn't bad, but we can really go into a shame hole when we want to be funny and it doesn't land. With more healing around this one, we again see our humanity, that some jokes are great, some jokes bomb, some are cringy, but those don't have to require a shame spiral about being a terrible person if we bomb. That is really about our family and not about the present. As a side note, some childhood trauma survivors, this is super specific, some childhood trauma survivors tell jokes or make references that no one really gets because they're , specific. And yes, it could be a neurodivergent issue, but that's not what I'm referencing here. There's a phenomenon of an inner child thing where we kind of tend to think that everyone has watched episode seven, season four of Doctor Who, and we make jokes about it, thinking everyone's gonna kind of get that. We don't really kind of assume kind of a thing, but there's something kind of going on in it. I think it could come from really neglect and not learning how to read others or not learning how to do lead-ins with people, have you seen Doctor Who. Are you a fan. You can read Doctor Who.

    "output": "There's something ever-changing about the interests of an adult that's inside of the attitude of somebody or that tries to laden them with the word Bea. And it may be more difficult for them to advance their needs by changing their personalities and families and worldviews and then, let's go back to number three. It's very much down to our emotional and eye-catching beliefs, or soft environments. I can only think about arcadics as starting抱 in the world, and I can never think of situations where I'm , oh, I'm электrot. for the overreaction of kind of getting fighty with somebody, or we can stay angry and self-righteous as. It usually comes from a childhood of being the butt of jokes and the family behaving the child is defective in some way. Or your family would talk about you behind your back or treat you needed special help when you actually didn't. Or you were judged simply for being a child and not an adult. it's a highly common shame reaction for those who were scapegoated and things were extremely personal. And as a side note, the reverse in taking it personally is also the shame example where we always assume that we're wrong and someone asks us the same question. One reaction could be, I'm not an idiot. The other reaction is, oh my God, I'm an idiot. They found out. Shame influences our perception about what people are communicating to us. We can greatly misinterpret questions and react from what the F do you mean by that to profusely apologizing and both reactions are ruled by shame. And incidentally, working on our childhood trauma will take care of a lot of these shameful issues if we're really looking at how we lost our goodness in our family system. But healing with this one, what that might look is that we're able to take questions and not take it personally or go to such an apologetic place because again, we've got this foundation of knowing that we're a good person and we don't lose that. Moving on to number four is this idea that shame is contagious. Those who struggle with shame can overly take on or overly feel the shame of others in uncomfortable situations.",

We can resonate with such people musical tuning forks and feel terrible for them and even feel terrible about ourselves somehow. That's how insidious shame can be. This can get us into trouble in relationships with emotionally immature or narcissistic people. We can overly feel for them in their mess and their mistakes and we resonate too much with their mess. This one can come from growing up with a parent who is immature or would make a mess out of their life or somehow they might have been a tragic figure nothing went for them. I'm not judging this is real or kind of self-imposed by them and as children growing up with a tragic parent or immature parent. We were really focused on them. We were really we paid a lot of attention to them. We might have even been absorbed in their mess. And the shame can come from as little kids. We want to be able to help them. We're not seeing them as an immature. We just want to help our parent who is a who's a hot mess, but the shame might come from our inability to do that. This one is also about not being protected as a child from adult emotions and adult situations. I often say as kids many of us knew too much when shame is healed in a good enough way with this one. We can be sympathetic and empathetic for those struggling but energetically we're boundary and we don't have to take all of that kind of stuff on we're able to kind of let people be themselves. There's no longer this gray area and we're safe in ourselves to know that we're not bad for not taking someone else's mess on what needs to get healed in this one. And I'll talk about later is we can feel we're cold or we're narcissistic for not taking on someone else's mess or shame based situations of others and not helping them.

There's a thing in society that does that got to get the degree the house the spouse the kids the career and then at 70 you can just chill. Although with childhood trauma based shame from CPTSD. There's a tendency to bloom later in life that I find which I think is actually better and I'm biased. Because I bloomed much later in life than my high school peers, but the shame here is about situation. She's just not having a partnership when your peers have long since been in long-term relationships are married the shame here tells us that society standards are benchmarks to our worthiness. The benchmarks aren't shameful unto themselves, but for survivors of childhood trauma intimacy and careers or being in the world seamlessly others can be is a complicated thing that we have to kind of work towards or do work around. In a highly common childhood trauma issue is not wanting to have children for fear of harming them in the way that we were harmed or not feeling confident to be able to get them what they need that is both kind of a setup from our own childhood. But I also think it's kind of a noble decision of protecting your kind of protecting society from the same old stuff, which is I believe to be noble and I know this is a deep personal issue for people. I don't mean to kind of speak lightly to it or go too fast. When this is healed, we can accept and embrace late-blooming or our choices in life and our decisions and it doesn't have to be such a heartbreaking comparison healing.

Traditional grip is in your left hand or your non-dominant hand, actually, you play the drum this, and your other hand plays this. It's an old marching band kind of a thing.

You master pivot tables, or if I mastered traditional grip, there'd be some other impossible standard where shame might say, , you learned pivot tables, but you don't know how to code. not good enough or enough is enough is an exhausting form of shame where you might be an amazing artist who thinks that they suck because they never learned how to do watercolors, even though you hate watercolors, that kind of a thing. where this comes from in childhood, and I think it comes from being raised by a highly critical or miserable parents who had off expectations or were full of shame themselves, you might have been taught that someone is always going to be better or greatness or worth, or being good enough is for other people, not you guys. you'll never measure up the family or parent could have also sabotage things because you or they didn't meet possible Olympic or Pulitzer Prize or Grammy based kind of expectations. it's magical thinking and weird expectations. Kids can also come up with unreasonable expectations on themselves or tell themselves that they won't be loved or liked their best friend is unless they learn how to do something that they can do the cartwheel or play whatever. And it can come from really watching who gets attention in school that we can have this part of shame going on.",

There's much stuff that we compare and judge ourselves against. It's lovely when all that kind of washes away. I've met many childhood trauma survivors who made great money and what they do, but they expressed anxiety about not being at the top of their field. Only to discover that they're actually happy where they're at and it's just old self-imposed pressure from childhood. Number eight is something that I called. Yes, it's serious. Instead of taking things personally, this shame example is about taking things too seriously. A classic example I give is when you're invited to a party and you need to bring the most perfect expensive or thoughtful thing and bringing anything less means that you're a terrible person. things can be very serious for you while being thoughtful and caring is really a good thing. It's not great when it's coming from a place about shame or fear or control. If you have a partner that's let's just bring some chips and salsa and call it a day and that starts a fight that might be a clue for you. This is nuanced and FYI, but I'm I'm talking about the marked need to cover your bases. people don't think ill of you or think that you're an f-up or a terrible person or that you don't look trashy in some way could be another kind of word with that. The same thing with gifts. It has to be a really thoughtful can't be phoned in gift and that can be a lot of pressure. Why and yes, it's nice to be able to give thoughtful gifts, but it's is it coming from shame where you have to look a certain way or cover or you're preventing someone from judging or criticizing you in childhood. This can really come from growing up with a parent who took things way too seriously as and had a lot of perfectionism and control to growing up and say shameful poverty or chaos. And the shame there is where you were hiding and influenced by is about never wanting to look poor or look selfish or look on caring or look thoughtless again. It can also be about compensating.",

And lastly, there's also regret attacks it's 2 a. m. You're trying to sleep and your brain brings up that goofy thing. You said in class 20 years ago and you feel a shame surge. I see that one about being is about hypervigilance popping up to keep us in an elevated place to make sure we don't do shameful things some final thoughts. trying to heal childhood trauma based shame keep thinking about the words integrity goodness and power little children are very vulnerable to those things. And then our wounds as survivors are often about our goodness being taken away or not being encouraged to have any power or to take any risk or simply be seen as a good kid. It's a highly vulnerable thing to be human and it's really tough to have those early experiences mess up our sort of present life based to shame and understanding our shame can take some reflective work next time you feel bad or you feel triggered. Ask yourself might it be related to shame. Here's some questions for you. Is your trigger about how you're being seen is your trigger about not measuring up is your trigger about being taken advantage of or feeling you're being taken advantage of are you compensating to cover something up is your anxiety about not doing enough today. All of our triggers. I think it's going to have an undercurrent of shame to them in some way, even if it's shame under rage shame under sadness shame under freak out.

That other people are human too and it's often not about us when they trigger us that we can start to laugh things off authentically and not take the world seriously or take ourselves seriously that we're not bad for wanting what everyone else wants being noticed being loved being included and lastly and I know that this is nuanced for many people but I think healing shame is going to involve accepting our personal timeline. It's better to get the things late on your own timeline. In the end. And on your own process to never get the things at all. I'd love to know your thoughts leave a comment if you strongly resonated with any of these and add what you might have felt was missing.

Kind of how I am now, although it took a lot of work to get back to being a ball of good times. I was the baby and I remember laughing a lot, having a lot of fun, having a lot of fun loving energy. And I don't remember everything from three, but I remember just being off the wall and kind of fun. Here I am at about 11, another picture, and here I'm struggling emotionally. Not just being a ginger in long sleeves on an airfield in the summer. My family didn't really believe in things dressing appropriately for the weather, which is pretty much a sign of neglect. Raise your hand out there if you can relate to that. If we fast forward four years or to around maybe seventh grade picture day, that fun loving energy that you see in the three-year-old pic is diminished. And check out the faux silk shirt via the 90s, early 90s. That time in my life, I remember being highly excited about my future. I remember being a little bit more of a kid, but I remember being anxious, not in my body, struggling with a lot of shame, but didn't quite really know that, couldn't really quite name that. And I knew something was off, but I was really doing my best to hide it. My home life was a mess with things alcoholism, violence, illness. Another five years down the road and this melancholic dysthymia, a low-grade depression had set in, that I also did my best trying to hide. I was described by my friends as being very chill, easygoing, and they weren't really aware of the mess that was going on or the symptoms that was going on underneath all this. And my whole identity was wrapped up in being a musician, which wasn't real authenticity either, but we all need something to latch on to when we grow up without a sense of self. And I did a good job at appearing chill, very open, very accommodating. My personality was funny, but also really down and dark. I could easily bring people down with some negativity.",

The drugs and alcohol that I started kind of coping with all this stuff around the age of 13 wasn't helping all this. why am I saying all this. , the point is, is how do we go from this to this. Later in the video, you'll hear a category of each personality called, isn't just this the way that I am. And that's what I actually thought about around that time too. And also, how do we get back to this. You'll also want to stick around, for how to figure out maybe how to do that, which is pretty, it's complex. I believe we're born with this spark and this personality. And it's the role of our caretakers to help that personality come more and more to light as we develop. And I believe a healthy parent helps shape what is already there and sort of gets out of the way of the child, has enough sense to notice the child's uniqueness. And yes, those who get this from a parent are super fortunate. And , in terms of trauma, we can't really form a healthy sense of self. We can't really develop in the inequalities when we're born kind of into a vacuum, meaning that if a parent is abusive, toxic, not interested in us, and they're really off, we have to develop somehow around all that. That's what I mean about the vacuum. The vacuum is the absence of healthy mirroring in the midst of it not being safe to be ourselves really. , and no one's helping us become ourselves. If you struggle with the sense of self, and I haven't really, I haven't really, I haven't really, I haven't really met a childhood trauma survivor who hasn't yet, it's because the real us usually gets buried underneath what happened to us in childhood, if you grew up in childhood trauma. The real you is under there, it's under how you adapted to what was going on around you. And as a side note, we all still have that personality that we're born with, that spark. It just hasn't been in a safe environment, with safe people yet, to be able to kind of be developed and come out.",

    "output": "I was able to get mine back in therapy. specifically a childhood trauma group where these personality and all these issues could be discussed and worked with. here is my take on five childhood trauma-based personalities and how to work on them to become more authentic. And as you listen to each of the five, you probably might be a bit confused about what I'm talking about because it's really going to seem I'm talking about trauma responses. What is wild about all this is that trauma personalities are really rooted in fight, flight, freeze, shame, submit, cry for help. And it's in kind of all the responses that you'll see here. And it's kind of difficult to separate the trauma response from the personality because they're entwined. here goes. Keep your focus on what causes these as opposed to feeling down about yourself or experiencing some shame. If you identify with one of the five, you're probably going to identify with a two out of the five. let's dive into them. Number one, what I'm calling the doer. Got to do something. The doer has a personality that is based upon taking action as a way to avoid their feelings or more specifically going back into their childhood feelings. Here are some behaviors and traits. They can be very high achieving, focused on work. They can be highly workaholic as a strategy to avoid intimacy into themselves. They can tend to want to nail experiences as opposed to being present. They want to ace the party. They want to nail the vacation. They want to seize the day. And if they don't do those things, they kind of feel they failed. They tend to be reactive to situations in terms of solving them upfront. They tend to skip the feelings of a situation. The doer doesn't dwell on being rear ended. They go into business. They sometimes don't even dwell on being treated poorly by other people. They go into figuring out the why instead of feeling what's going on. They can put a lot of energy into doing things. They can think things correctly or morally correctly. They can also greatly overdo things. Being a mess or making mistakes is a doer's kryptonite. As a therapy client, they want to be the perfect client. They want to get an A in therapy.",

They can be really hard on people around things perfectionism or how people show up for them in specific ways. They overly value telling it is. I'm sure we all have known someone that. Hostiles can struggle with self-boundaries around going there. They can easily go there with people. They are frequently fine with upsetting apple carts or go out of their way to do. They can feel they have to. And as a side note, we're not talking about narcissism here. We're talking about a CPTSD response, although it may sound it. I was a hostile at one point. , hostiles can come across as intense without knowing it. Part of their dissociation or lack of healthy feedback, and mirroring. They can often be that scapegoated kid and be rebelling against the world or defending against never tolerating being the problem again. Relationally, they don't know how not to try to dominate for true instead of being truly equal with someone, with mutual respect. It's kind of foreign to them. Hostiles are often paired with number five, which is what I'm calling the all good that I'll get into later. Two hostiles together generally doesn't really work , but that can kind of happen too. And you might be thinking, boy, geez, what a insert swear word kind of person. But again, I was a hostile at one point and I definitely could be described as a big juicy old swear word at that time in my life. And as an interesting side note, I became a hostile after getting out of being sort of very people pleasing when I started to do some trauma work and then I had to work on my rage and hostility that would come out. , these can be fluid depending on where you're at in your recovery. How childhood set the hostile up. I often see it mainly as being raised by other hostiles. this is modeled. And the family's kind of miserable, lives in high conflict. And that bizarrely becomes normalized. They can also be family scapegoats I mentioned, or they can be greatly let down by people. A lot of hostility is around, don't let me down kind of stuff.",

    "output": "When you really think about it, households that have intense shouting, volatile screaming going on every day is really a sign of poor mental health in the adults. of course the hostility is gonna get absorbed sometimes. The child can learn to easily go to an anger place or an intense place with people because that's just how things are done. Hostiles can experience culture shocks when they go to a friend's house. Or maybe when they're of age, they move out and start dating people. Or they're at their first job and their hostility comes out. And that new environment or the new people are , whoa,. That's usually a first sign to the trauma survivor that they've got something going on about them that isn't quite appropriate in a lot of different places. some will kind of double down all that and rebel more because they're being triggered back to their family system, still reacting to the family kind of FU, FU kind of stuff. Here are some other childhood trauma causes for the hostile. Being say a child of immigrants where they had to be the interpreter or they were really ashamed of their parents or they were told that they were entitled in the new culture versus the old culture. Being put into possible and situations that weren't safe and they were really let down. Having parents not take any action getting a job or getting them out of poverty and just having to sit there and think, oh, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna sit with the heaviness and weight of all that. A child being raised in addiction, poverty, high drama. Big one here is having an emotionally immature parent and the child had to become the parent or become bossy. Frustration, rage, knowing what the thing is but not having any adults to kind of follow through on that, of course they're hostile. They definitely become hostile because of being powerless or stuck, often messed with. How hostile struggle and intimacy. I often see hostiles, I said, create distance by making their partners unsafe with their projections. They often need to be superior to their partner which again creates more distance. Hostiles might say things , oh, you didn't listen to me about the car. , you're cut off. You should know better. You forgot something important to me, didn't you.",

I'm not saying that's bad, but I'm trying to kind of give you an image about what is happening for them inside. They can often struggle with a fearful avoidant attachment style. They can be ruled by negativity and unfortunately can bring others down with them while they point out that things aren't as great as they seem you're looking at a beautiful whitewater river in the Grand Canyon or something that. And they bring up , oh, it's probably not gonna be here in a thousand years. Wah, wah. the other personalities, they struggle to feel authentic joy and the darkness is often ruled by an intense shame or some anxiety. The darkness takes things intensely personal, real or imagined. The darkness reminds me of the Nirvana line. I miss the comfort of being sad. We can be comforted in that kind of vibe or that sadness. the other trauma personalities, the darkness doesn't have to be in that 24 seven, although they can be, they can be also be quite funny and quite engaging. The darkness often has this marked, acute negative self image that they can drain other people with. And they're usually not aware of that coming back to that vacuum that I mentioned earlier. They might have a strategy to downplay themselves or insult themselves to beat others to the punch, kind of do it for them in a way. They can have a strong, fixed, rigid belief system that keeps them stuck and doesn't serve them. Negativity, rigidity, and hard living can kind of be that vibe. They can very much self punish. They can really be knocked out in decision making for the struggles they have with being good enough or what people might think about them. The darkness can have a highly moralistic kindness to them, which again, isn't bad, but they might destroy themselves to say, save a goldfish or something that, which is actually kind of endearing, but it's still a trauma response rooted in poor self care. Here's how childhood trauma set up the darkness for this personality. The darkness usually experiences high levels of interpersonal trauma and betrayal growing up.",

A good interpersonal group can really help the darkness see that it creates more distance and that it frustrates and affects other people, that their negativity kind of does that, or that they may lose connection with the darkness based upon because they're already sort of walking out of the room while still being present, because they're removing themselves from the intimacy. Moving onto the fourth trauma personality, what I'm calling The Ghost, or how do I get out of here. The Ghost is a trauma personality ruled by the freeze response, and they struggle with a lot of inaction and avoidant behaviors. If you've ever heard of the Irish good-bye, it's a good window into the Ghost. the other personalities, there can be varying degrees of ghostiness depending on what is going on for the Ghost. Some live in it 24-7, and some don't. Here are some qualities and characteristics. Ghost trauma personalities can be hard to know. They can be very much there as a consistent co-worker or team member or teammate or something, but knowing them emotionally is hard to a non-existent level somewhat, kind of the doer. Ghosts are often ruled by a dismissive avoidant attachment style. It doesn't have to be just that one. Ghosts come across as kind of aloof or self-sufficient or even kind of needing rescue at times. They can feel greatly blocked in knowing how to connect with others from moment to moment. It can often be very readable to others that the ghost would rather not be present with them and they want to be doing something else. Often identified as introverts, which is all fine and good, I think we all need some kind of time alone, but ghosts consistently stay inside themselves. It's a bit different. Ghosts can be childhood scapegoats who have shut down and don't want to infect others with their scapegoat qualities and experience it all over again, they kind of hide. The ghost can really want connection at times. They can sign up for things and start friendships or relationships, and then there might be an abrupt exit or hiding, they're in it and then they're out of there maybe.",

There's really no better or worse. It's all a setup later for problems in authenticity and in adulthood. How the ghost personality struggles in intimacy. Sadly, the ghost can go numb or even mute in intimacy and not be able to do any kind of connection really around conflict, which leaves the other person really stuck without knowing what to kind of do because they kind of they don't really have much to work with there. The ghost can also avoid relationships and they think they really don't need them. They can be single for a long time. They can be perpetually dating and not really be in a relationship to ghost can really hide in their partner may interpret that wrongly as a dishonesty or secrecy, which I see a lot. In the past when I've done couples work, it's often just shutting down but not living really a separate life, which might we might feel , but I'm also not saying they can't hide things or be secretive. It just kind of really feels that to the partner. I'm saying it's possible as. Ghost might be the hardest to get in therapy and stay in therapy. And I see it as their freeze to flight response where they need to go back to their apartment and kind of recover from people. In short, in order to do intimacy work and to be good, we have to be able to know each other, actually. The ghost has this intimacy fantasy, can't we just love each other and exist without talking too much or bringing anything up. That's kind of how they want things to be. Isn't this just who I am. A ghost is definitely going to believe that they are fixed in that personality. And yes, again, we can be born introverted, no problem, but introverts are also capable of intimacy. I don't believe that we're born to want to avoid connection when we really think about it. Biologically, as babies and toddlers, connection is crucial and we seek it out for survival. It can feel, it really tells you what that child went through.",

    "output": "It can feel impossible to change these trauma personalities, but that's not true. But ghosts can definitely ghost because they kind of ghost themselves because of what happened. How to become more real. I think the first step for the ghost is to really buy into the fact that it doesn't help them in what they maybe want. And that what is missing is actually connection and getting them to buy into that is tricky. All of these trauma personalities know in a deep, tiny, secret place that there's got to be something more. And they're about that. Ghosts can be tricky for therapists who want to go into processing places or places of depth, which is actually what the ghosts, they came in for, but they struggle kind of going there. They're going to need a lot of help with that. In groups that are, say, effective and interpersonal working groups, it's helpful. It's helpful for the ghosts to hear from other members that they don't really know them. Ghosts can think that just showing up is good enough to be known, and it's kind of a shock to them. Ghosts will benefit from hearing from others working on themselves, that they want to know them more, and they want them to take some small risk becoming real by actually saying what is on their mind. Even it's , I don't want to be here. My inner child just wants to be home alone. That's something. A good therapist would want the ghost to be able to get to a place in their work to kind of open up, to express themselves, to be more, kind of learn how to be expressive and say what's kind of on their mind, and not easily leave the conversation or easily leave relationships. Coming to the fifth trauma personality is something that I'm calling the are we good or are we. The are we good is a people-pleasing, focused personality that is rooted in the fond response. They are often associated with an anxious, preoccupied attachment style, constantly making sure things are with a partner, and kind of defaulting to their partner to be tolerated. The are we good personality will tend to give away all of their power.",

It can simply mean going to a big place or an over-the-top place that puts our energy up or shuts us down. But what I really mean when I say triggered is that our inner child is up and is running our present from a place of being activated and our adult self, the adult part of us, is gone. You can even think about that as an overly activated limbic system which shuts down our frontal lobes and the adult is sort of MIA. The frontal lobes is where the adult part of us sort of resides or our best communicative self, our best sort of thinking self. there's that. Let's jump in and let's see if you guys identify or resonate with any of these. let's look at the first one, number six. People who are thoughtless or oblivious. This can be anybody that , can be somebody on the street, can be co-workers, can be whatever. Some examples. People who are gregarious or loud and they're oblivious to how they are.",

    "output": "And I see not saying no as not asking for help. I see them in a similar way. That's totally an inner child thing. The way out of this one is practicing saying no from our adult space. As reparenting our inner child. Talking about the lack of not being considered. The lack of not being seen. And how our parents or our boss or our partner or our boss does not have the ability to read what is going on with us the way that our inner child wants them to. We can say no to our partner about going out but not really giving them a lot of sort of the business about it. We can say no to a boss, even though that's hard. We can say no to a boss up front by being sort of clear and honest. Sort of clear and forthright about what our responsibilities sort of are. Even if it's hard. hopefully that one made sense. That was a mouthful. number four. Having someone be mad at you slash being misunderstood. Yes. No one is super pumped to have someone be mad at them. But for childhood trauma survivors this is where we ruminate about what we did. Why is the person mad. How do we get them to change our mind at us. How do we state our case. How do we get through to them. Some examples the bus driver who is disgusted with you when you don't have cash on you. The co-worker who is frustrated with you that you've taken time off. Or the partner who is upset with you sort of in a bump. Or even worse, siblings when they feel you're not supporting the toxic parent enough. That's probably an off the charts kind of trigger. This one is rooted in shame. Having people be mad at us and being misunderstood. Growing up in abuse it really wasn't safe to have someone be mad at us. In fact, that is the stuff that stays in a kid's body when they are actively shamed and raged at by a toxic parent. , I can't believe you've done this. I can't believe you would ask me for that now. Is all that stuff that's really actively sort of shaming a child. And I'm being really light about it.",

    "output": "Some kids are just flat out raged at to the point that they leave their bodies. worrying about someone being mad at us will take over. Just as it did in childhood. It's a shame attack. healing this is to reclaim the ability to be misunderstood. And what do I mean by that. I mean that the adult part can parent the child on the difference between being terrified. It being terrifying to have a toxic parent be mad at you when they have all the power. To the difference of having a grumpy co-worker who is frustrated. Real or imagined. We were great parents. We were greatly misunderstood growing up. And this is, I'm still trying to make sense of this. I've been in practice for a while. Our parents didn't see us as children. Toxic parents usually see their kids as selfish adults who are making choices at their expense. Which is super messed up. But that's the definition of being misunderstood. That the expectations were off. We weren't seen as children. That we weren't seen as children. We were expected to be forward thinking adults. hopefully that makes sense to you. And that kind of childhood wrecks regular old frustration. It is humanly impossible to not have others be frustrated at us or mad at us from time to time. or wrong. And it's very freeing to allow someone to be grumpy or even sort of toxic and not take it in. One of my favorite recovery ideas is to just let other people feel their feelings. Even if it's about us. But that wasn't safe growing up. And if we heal shame, everything is just much more manageable. imagine the ability to be , oh they're a little , my co-worker is a little bit pissed at me. , I get it. They were frustrated. They had to pick up my slack. It'll pass or we'll work it out. Imagine having that ability that's super from the adult. But the inner child, that stuff needs to sort of get healed. , moving on. Number three. Other people's moods. Very similar to those of us who are in the middle of our lives. This is the last one. But this one's a ringer.",

And I tell people that everybody is different. I have clients that range from remembering everything in their childhood to missing huge timelines in their childhood or missing some smaller gaps. But there's something I notice in my work with those who have some memory loss that I'd really to say you guys up front and that what I notice is that survivors of trauma assume that uncovering or finding a lost database of memories is the only way to healing and until they uncover those things they're up the creek that is not true. I tell clients that actually you don't need extensive memories to figure out or work on childhood trauma. I also notice that clients with memory issues assume they don't have any real knowledge or awareness about how bad their childhood potentially was when that's not really true either. more than you think and you might be second guessing your awareness of your own family system. Having awareness of the family system you grew up in is different than unearthing childhood memories but it's just as helpful if not more helpful. And the memory loss is a very important part of the process. It's a very important part of the process. The memory issue is not seeing the forest through the trees. Survivors are often overly focused on the missing details of their childhood and not taking a step back and looking at the whole system that they grew up in. And I'm going to come back to that later in the video.",

And in my experience if those issues that I just mentioned are prevalent in a client's present then they probably were there in childhood as unless the family members went through some heavy-duty therapy or the whole family went through some heavy-duty therapy and that is super rare if they did. all of those present issues are all a client really needs to know to conclude that they probably grew up in some form of childhood trauma. And I tell clients , those present issues are good enough data to work backwards towards childhood to figure out things rather than recall childhood fully. In addition to focusing on the present family system, when clients start working with me I tell them that their childhood will become more real to them which happens by talking about the family system in therapy sessions, working backwards by starting with what they do know I just mentioned, working with their triggers and their body memories can help figure out that system even more. Working with our inner child who often has more access to childhood situations and emotions than our adult self does. And all of that doesn't mean achieving something full total recall but these help with not being dissociated from our story because we never bounced it off somebody or dived deeply into it. And regarding memory issues, clients can have a array of reactions to the therapy that I do such as some might become more aware of the abusive family but they don't recall the huge missing chunks of their childhood and that's actually.",

I'm probably thinking about how Ben didn't have a relationship with his father who never stood in as a parent because he was an alcoholic. He was absent but there, sort of. And this is how some clients often start, and it's good enough. And all they need to look at was how they were parented, but my clients come in thinking they need to have a cache of solid memories to figure this all out. The client and their sibling grew up in a tricky family with parents who needed their own therapy. Ben might say in session that he's expecting me to say that he's not traumatized enough to see me, and that's an expression of shame that's kind of tough to hear. As a childhood trauma therapist getting this info in the first session, I would be wondering the following. Could the lack of a present protective father and the mother's obsession with food have been overwhelming. Could that be all part of the reason why Ben's parents are sad. Could that be all part of the reason why Ben's parents are sad. Could that be all part of the reason why Ben's parents are sad. Could that be all part of the reason why Ben's parents are sad. Could that be all part of not being fully in his body as a child and being dissociated and contributing to not remembering. Was the family in some kind of way in this suspended animation where the parents were almost just playing house. Was the siblings acting out was sort of a ringing of an alarm about the home life, that her acting out was appropriate given that home life. The sister would have most likely ended up as the identified patient in family therapy, which is infuriating in the sense that the family is not the same. How about, Mr. Aznavina, how about you. How about you. How about you. What would you do to stop this. How would you take that. How about you. life-less or painfully long because the family does not know what to do with each other and everyone is just kind of in a quiet desperation. What might that be for a child.

But that person couldn't manage her father and was out of her life in just about two years.

And she also takes care of her mother who never remarried and is depressed and feels immense guilt when she doesn't call her mother weekly. But she absolutely dreads those calls. She feels immense guilt and guilt. And anxiety about taking care of the brother who she describes as a time bomb when he visits and knows that something is up to come in for some trauma work.

And for most of her childhood, she does say in passing that recently the mother told her that in the early stages of the divorce, she left her and her brother with her father for, say, six months.

The responds that a mother is unkempt about her son's world is terrifying. the online times are trying to found the biggest examples and trying to find the missing families mentions. Given a difference in January or two years ago for kids.

They didn't form lasting memories either because they didn't have healthy adults to share those moments with, or the stress of that childhood caused them to dissociate from the present and think of getting through childhood as opposed to taking it in. When working with their inner child, I'd have them do left-hand and -hand dialoguing in a session to get a deeper sense of what it was for them to be a kid in that house. With Ben, I'd have him ask his inner child, How did you feel about Dad. What was it with Mom and food. What kind of kid did you feel. What did you feel you were. Notice how the questions are open-ended questions. Often the inner child will respond with memories or situations that the adult has been removed from for the years, and that is a very powerful experience. Some clients get it back by simply talking about it over time, about what they know. I had a client in their 50s who started working with me, and they weren't really able to tell me much about their childhood, but they were able to kind of tell me, , in one of those genograms. And over the three years that I was working with them, more and more memories, and more details and situations came up for them as we went along. And there was a process in the work that I do where I tell clients that childhood will become more and more real to them as we continue the work. By the third year, they would come up with situations and scenarios about their abuse that I had never heard from them before. And also, when we talk about the family systems and compare what their family system was compared to healthy family systems, that also helps us process and get a greater view of the forest through the trees. In addition, your triggers will help what your story is as.

    "output": "You don't have to necessarily agree with it. And as a male, I've experienced both a toxic mother and a father, but obviously not as a daughter, along with how society views and treats daughters. now let's explore some lasting problems or the cycles of having a toxic father. Even if he's not in your life. Here are the big three lasting problems in having a toxic father for daughters. Number one, most importantly with a toxic father, daughters tend to get stuck in replicating dynamics in their relationship, mainly their romantic relationships. This is in the form of projection. That's going to look that replication and projection, replicating the old dynamics, is going to look dating the same kind of dysfunctional person, in a pattern. It's going to look giving up power, your personal power or defaulting to men or defaulting to the masculine to avoid being in trouble. Replication is going to look trying to control a partner, trying to get them healthier or save a partner, either from themselves or save them from somebody else. It's going to look seeking connection or approval from older men. I know that sounds icky, but that's a thing for both men and women in childhood trauma, or trying to get an aloof or moody man to see you or tolerate you. Replication is also going to look being extremely dysregulated, around men or flat out hating them in general. All of these are examples of the replication, and most importantly that our inner child projects those dynamics. It's just how that stuff works. it's maybe your job to rescue a man, or that all men are rageful and unpredictable, or men are incapable, you have to do all the work, in the concept of weaponized incompetence, which is a thing in the present. To our inner child, these can feel viscerally true to survivors, and we have to explore projection of the toxic, father that we had that happens were projected onto our present. I'm not saying in any way that men are a thousand percent safe. Past and present childhood trauma work is highly nuanced and tricky. I'll say more about that later. The second of the big lasting three is that you might be currently still struggling with the toxic father in your present life.",

    "input": "I'm struggling with healing. Can you help me understand what's happening?",
    "output": "Remember what I said earlier about these are not things that we would have chosen, meaning we are not responsible for those stuck places. I mean, we are responsible for the healing, but no one would have asked for those things. parents have a lot of power, if not all the power, to tell their children who they are, and either directly or indirectly, or through neglect. deep in our core, how they felt about us is how we feel about us. But toxic people no longer get to tell us who we are. Remember that. Moving on, here are some complicating, outside factors in these toxic father-daughter dynamics. Here are some things we need to address before getting into the types of toxic fathers. And there are some additional complicating factors for daughters of toxic fathers. These are things that daughters are taught at home, and in their community and cultures that will amp up the toxic father-daughter dynamics. First is growing up and living in a patriarchal male-dominated culture. And actually, we're kind of hard-pressed to find a culture that isn't patriarchal in that way. But as daughters, you might have had to grow up in things a toxic belief that girls are more likely to bring shame onto a family or community, rather than what boys do. In kind of in a very hypocritical way, a part of what can bring a woman down more in society and in her family, for the most part, is perpetuating men. But we see this as a culture that shames women about an interaction with a male, versus as seeing the male's behavior, first. Also at home, what a mother models in response to the toxic father at home, minimizing the abusive father's behavior, or concluding that all men are that, is a powerful complicating factor that affects daughters and their conditioning. An abused mother can model self-blame. A toxic mother can model unstable relationships with men. A mother can be a hostage without any power. If your mother spent her life defaulting to, or chasing moody, unavailable, men, that's going to have an impact on both daughters and sons. Another complicating factor is there can also be internal misogyny from a mother to her daughter, or being taught that it's your fault about whatever happens, because you're a woman and you should know better, or women are manipulative.",

    "output": "And as a side note, men who have gone through childhood trauma with a toxic mother, also have their own damaging paradoxes at home and in society. No child in the toxic family is unaffected, by these kind of dynamics. Two common paradoxes in men, is that the man who is too submissive to a woman, due to having an abusive mother, that mother had a belief that men should never upset a woman, and be totally selfless, and that could be an additionally modeled by a codependent father. He was taught that women are always innocent, which gets him into abusive relationships, or he can be very unreal or passive, if he's in a relationship with you. The other paradox, and this is difficult to explain, but men having a lot of projection in rage and contempt for women, this is toxic masculinity, because their mother was potentially codependent or manipulative, or it was modeled by a toxic father. And I see unsafe men as often having this hypervigilance about seeking out and finding hypocrisy in women. You'll kind of see it, if you think about it in a way, that they're always trying to find the shadiness in women, as part of a trait in toxic masculinity. Daughters can get caught up in similar damaging choices and dynamics, to submit to the opposite sex, or have conditioned contempt for the opposite sex. And then there is patriarchal and misogynistic and misandry that happens inside and outside of the home. It's really a mess for childhood trauma survivors, and there are always two highly impacted inner children, in a relationship, of any and all gender identities. Not just cisgender, as I've discussed here, that come from dysfunctional or toxic families. Think about it this way. What biases did your father perhaps have about women. What biases did your mother maybe have about men. What biases did your father have about men. What biases did your mother have about women. For a lot of childhood trauma survivors, that is a huge kind of can of unconscious worms to unpack. And everyone's situation will be known, and everyone's situation will be nuanced. I'm just suggesting to you, the viewer, to explore deeper about what and where some of these issues can come from, especially around projection and replication, and I'll explain more in a moment.",

But it's different from the past in two ways. This is really important. You have more power now as an adult to shift and change. But you had none as a toxic father's daughter growing up. Anytime we say all men are that. Or all women are that. Or I'm never going to be able to feel comfortable or safe. Or I'll always get let down by people that. That's that projection replication stuff. People can be a-holes. I get that. But when we project. We go back to feeling powerless. And then we're looking for evidence about how we're not safe. Our inner child is looking to confirm past perpetrators with present people. There are some present perpetrators. But if we're only focused on confirming what isn't safe. We'll actually never find what is safe and find some healing there. All five types of toxic fathers can overlap. We can have a monster and an absent stranger combination. You can have a tragic codependent father who's also a crazy maker. But those overlaps are not really that important. You probably will have some overlap. What is important is about being able to recognize your triggers and the dynamics that still need to be dealt with. I'm trying to say don't get caught up in it's really bad because my dad had all five kind of categories. One other final thought is something called trauma bias that I mentioned. Trauma bias and choosing our own path. Choosing our partners. Let's just say your father was a tragic codependent and enmeshed and you were his surrogate spouse. Person you're dating or a man you're dating who seems he doesn't overshare or maybe he doesn't even share at all or can assert himself and maintain his own autonomy might be really attractive to you. But because of our inner child feels it might feel intolerable to our inner child to be with someone again who is somewhat cowardly or tragic or enabling or unprotective.",

But because of your trauma or your trauma bias you might construe that independence as healthy when maybe it isn't. We often have a broken radar system due to that trauma bias in our inner child just does not want to be stuck with a similar type of partner or man again. Another example is being able to see the world. Being attracted to someone who seems they really have their stuff together because your father was a really messy crazy maker but because of that trauma bias you don't catch that the person who has their stuff together is actually incredibly controlling and rigid and it's actually not that they're adjusted. Trauma bias is our inner child looking for the rescue from dynamics that were horrific to us but we need help seeing the whole picture that's different than tunnel vision.

    "output": "I believe that these delays are really due to the childhood trauma issues of dissociation and hypervigilance. Childhood trauma survivors struggle with not fully being in their body and not being present in their emotions in real time. We tend to live in a cerebral kind of anxious place and a thinking place of, and maybe that's where they're quickly saying yes to things because we live in a little bit of an emergency, which will be on another issue coming up later. It might be due to that kind of energy we have. The hypervigilance, I believe, is when our inner child kind of goes, wait a minute, , this, was I just taken advantage of or was I just let down again. Or perhaps some anger and sadness comes up later. , kids growing up in childhood trauma leave their emotional body. They go up into their heads and watch out for what the adults are doing or what the adults need. And we're not attuned with ourselves and what we have going on in real time in our childhood, what we need emotionally. We can trace an example of dissociations and hypervigilance, say, if you grew up in domestic violence. And let's just say there's a fight on a Tuesday night and on Wednesday you wake up and then the worry about the other parent really starts to catches up with you as you go to school. That's an example of where this stuff isn't in real time because during the fight on that Tuesday night, the child is too busy being freaked out about safety or just the charge of it. , they're not even thinking. They're just kind of frozen. some treatment recommendations for this. Practice discussing emotions when they come up with safe people. And I know the intimacy of that is kind of scary, but that's our way out of this. Another recommendation is know that when it happens that it's your inner child catching up to the event that happened earlier after kind of living underground because maybe you're in a baseline other trauma response, just living in emergency. Start to explore. Some daily inner child dialoguing, which is journaling with your inner child. It's not just regular dialoguing. It's dialoguing between your non dominant hand and dominant hand.",

Imagine growing up in something alcoholism or a secretive family or a fundamentalist. , a fundamentally religious family where one false step that you make can have terrible consequences for you or others. when things come up, we're on it. , I see many clients, including myself, rushing through life or are used to in living in an emergency because they're running from the possibility of making mistakes and looking bad or having others kind of see us as defective or chaotic the families we come from. Something imposter syndrome. Or that could be a root of imposter syndrome. The rushing can also involve unconsciously covering something up, trying to prevent a disaster that isn't really real, but it was real in our childhood. we do need to have some compassion for ourselves. And a funny example of this, as a northerner from the U. S. , and there was a storm in 1978 called the blizzard of 78. And there was where we got snowed in for a week and people ran out of food and they would have to take sleds and go down to the low end. And they would have to go down to the local quickie mart and, , get bread and milk. there's this joke about getting bread and milk. But still in New England, the minute it starts snowing, that people have this emergency reaction , I got to get the bread and milk. It's kind of an example of that rushing where that storm was 40 years ago when we generally don't run out of food up there. But that's still kind of ingrained. some treatment recommendations in this one. Working with our inner child on really slowing down. Another is dialoguing and journaling with our inner child about those emergencies. That don't really exist, but they did exist in childhood. And simply asking our inner child on paper, what do you think is going to happen if we don't get to the appointment early or on time. What's the fear about.",

This one is really interesting and really unique to me. It's something that I call refrigerator buzz depression. The issue is you don't notice that you're depressed because you've maybe been that way since early childhood. , with a refrigerator that buzzes, you might have had this refrigerator for years and you're , one day you're , what's that sound.

Or friends might be , , I don't really live that in that kind of really shut down lethargic. And it isn't part of my everyday life. Is it that for you. you might get a reference point from there. And again, growing up in it, we don't have a reference point because we're just in the trauma where it might come from in childhood trauma. It might come from not getting any help as a child and processing emotions that they come up whether that's you're bullied at school. Or a pet dies. there's just really an emotionally vacant family system. Could be a backlog of childhood situations and dynamics that caused you to shut down but are still there needing to be processed. Just simply our parents' marriage is enough. Alcoholism, death in the family, medical trauma, hating your oppressive father, feeling nothing would change, kind of a hopelessness going on in the first 20 years of our life. And being depressed is actually a natural. It's a natural. It's actually a natural protective mechanism growing up and when we're growing up and all that.

Because the trauma core belief really got hit deep and was kind of taken out. Now I had a new belief that I was a good person. that's one part of how good psychotherapy group psychotherapy can help with that stuff. Being connected with good people and processing your family of origin trauma is helpful. There are really no real life hacks for depression. You can't really journal your way through it. You can't downward dog your way through it. But I do believe that processing what happened to us also helped me. This is a good example. I'm a really good school teacher. I'm a great teacher. us is a crucial step in sort of treating it. Treatment will involve awakening to how bad it was. And of course you struggle with depression, but that's what it was specifically for you, a core belief that things will never get better and I'm just awful, which is really essentially what I felt. And as a side note, when you start processing your childhood trauma, depressive symptoms kind of get worse in the beginning. just be aware of that. And it's the therapy at the time. Moving on related to depression is something that I'm called being tired as a trigger. This one's really not too complicated. It simply means that we confuse our natural body's reaction to being tired for depression or failing. it's a getting tired is a bummer for us. Childhood trauma survivors can be addicted to productivity or being on a mission. There's lots of overlap here with ADHD as another reminder of that. And we can confuse being tired for failing, not being good enough. Or it's again a feeling we might be abandoned if we're not up or something that. where this might come from childhood trauma, neglected kids get attached to coping and they aren't parented around basic things going to bed or taking care of themselves. We can unconsciously also associate with going to bed to being alone or being abandoned.",

It might come from trauma in the following ways. Many of us hid our home life and the hiding of our family or original group was happening really early. We might be hiding about intimate secrets and things my dad. My dad works for the government when the reality is your dad works at a sewage treatment plant and you're hiding some kind of reality there. Parents could model similar things around not mixing because of their own shame or their own hiding. Another idea is that mixing could have had terrible consequences for kids in the divorce and they pick up on all the energy going around in the bigger family system about going to grandmas who now trash talks mom or something that. And surviving trauma can be about keeping things separate to not hear criticism. that might be some reasons. some treatment ideas for chameleon but don't mix. Start to take some risk and simply introduce others to each other if you have different friend circles. Dialogue again with the inner child and walk through what the fear of what is going to happen if this person knows that person. How could things go wrong according to them. And embrace the idea that there's safety in adulthood that people can make their own choices about vibing with each other or not being able to do that. Moving on to number six. This one is a big one. Something that I call on the spot dissociation. Being on the spot involves everything from speaking at a work event to being simply asked a question or by a friend that might be a little bit intimate or even not. Could be just a simple honest question. Having attention on us and giving a response to that attention or presenting feels an attack and we might leave our bodies or we're in danger.

Ha. Or, , my mom dropped me off at my uncle's for babysitting telling me to not go into the bathroom alone with him. Isn't that wild. There's a charge to the way that we're being treated. There's a charge to the way that we're being treated. There's a charge to the way that we're being treated. And we're kind of that kind of expression and we are uncontrollably kind of bringing humor into it because I think we don't really know how to feel about it or how to talk about it otherwise. Where this might come from. I find this one to be of growing up in a highly toxic family wrapped up in some extreme neglect. That tends to be in my mind when I see a client doing this. And I think it can also come from, I was doing this as. I think it can also come from growing up in a highly caustic or sarcastic family, the anti-love family from my seven types of toxic family systems, where there's really kind of a nastiness to the day-to-day life, , where the family scoffs at emotional experiences and looks for opportunities to make fun of emotions, make fun of kids, make fun of vulnerability. It's really quite gross when you really think about it. Or parents could live in a sort of F my life kind of existence and they don't take themselves seriously as. some treatment recommendations. Be mindful of this tendency when we do this, because when we do this, we don't walk away feeling good about ourselves either. We just kind of go , oh, that was a little bit awkward or that was a little bit weird. Try to look at it as a symptom from your family of origin, abuse.

Finding support where you can talk about the stuckness or the numbness or work with the trauma, work with a therapist who can help you talk about the abuse while staying present and not going into the overwhelm or not going into the shutdown about it. Dialoguing with the inner child and ask them what happens when you try to cry or process when something overwhelming comes up to figure out what they might need from you, the inner adult. Or there might be a belief going on about the shutdown, about not crying that might be, , just boys don't cry or something. It could be something as simple as, , crying. , just boys don't cry or something. It could be something as simple as that.

It's just standard what happens to kids when they don't grow up in safety. Moving on to number nine, this one's interesting. Something that I call glass frog. They can all see through me. Glass frog is something simply that I made up. It's a species of frog. It's a body that is completely transparent and you can see all their organs. And it made me think of childhood trauma survivors myself who struggle with shame and hypervigilance. The idea is the feeling of being completely transparent when you are social, when you're around others. you go to a coffee shop and it feels they all had a meeting before you got there about how you, about you, about how you're a loser, how you suck. This is what I would experience when I would go. This wasn't exactly conscious. It was just feeling they were just , it was feeling being raw. It was just , it was feeling being raw. And exposed.",

Shame, hypervigilance. The hypervigilance is being focused on what other people think. Where it comes from. Again, major off things are happening at home for the child. Developmentally, I'm fascinated by this. They think the teacher might know that mom's an alcoholic or that dad punches walls. It's almost, I think it's almost wrapped up in a little bit of early object relations about thinking. Children think the adults are almost omnipotent and they, , when you make a mistake in the bathroom in kindergarten, it's almost you almost unconsciously assume that other people already know. Shame and hypervigilance. And related to that, abused kids have to come up with strategies of hiding what is going on with them. And think about it. If you've ever tried to sneak into a job after you, because you're 30 minutes late, because you're having a bad morning, that sneaking feeling might've been something you've been doing your whole life, hoping that you're not gonna be put on the spot, all of those things. Because we were vulnerable. We were, it was pretty transparent. Another examples of this is having to hide how fundamentally, religious your family was around others who were not having to pretend or mask your vulnerability due to being abused at home. Having insane hypercritical abusive parents where you had to hide that you watched a cartoon at a friend's house when you weren't supposed to, or you maybe you asked for seconds and you're worried about at the friend's house.

Another treatment idea is working with a supportive person or a group therapist on naming the shame that comes up for you around this. Dialoguing with our inner child, again, about specifically reparenting them on the idea that what do they think people think about them. If you can nail that, you're really gonna know what's going on with a lot of your triggers and your problems, because there's some, there's some things that you can do that are really the root to this glass frog issue.

I just start sobbing and not being able to relate to two things. Where it comes from in childhood.

And at that time when I got to therapy, I wouldn't have known to name my major problems that I had going on as not having a sense of self. That knowledge definitely came later in the course of therapy. And therapy was extremely helpful to me in getting my sense of self back. And actually it was therapy with others in a group therapy that I was doing that I'll talk more in depth about later. At that time in my life, to give you a picture of what not having a sense of self looks , for me it looked things this. I couldn't bring myself to disagree with people. I was extremely flexible, if not malleable, with other people. Making decisions was excruciating and I would continuously put them off because I could not make a decision to save my life. And I hid things that I liked or that I was passionate about for fear of how people would think about that. Things books, ideas, bands, whatever. And I would also put up with a lot of off behavior from friends and partners for fear of losing connection. Not having a sense of self is really a security issue. Related to that, I didn't have the skills to bring something up or even know that bringing something up during conflict was an option without blowing up on somebody or having that come out of nowhere, which is a trauma symptom. Being in a relationship for me made me feel and secure rather than having an inner sense of security. And I didn't have the skills to bring something up or even know that bringing something up was an option. I was really lost without having a person in my life. And being in a relationship to me felt a life vest. And I also had no sense of having any personal power or choice. I would only get out of situations due to last straws.

I talk about that in a video called 11 Oddly Specific Childhood Trauma Videos that I'll have in the description. And lastly, probably the most important part here is that I felt I was a fraud as a person. I saw others being able to assert themselves and their needs or embrace their choices and live from a place of, authenticity without really worrying about what others would think or say. All of that really baffled me. Even though that I wanted to be that, it was really baffling. For me, this thing felt imposter syndrome of pretending that I was a person. Not that it was imposter syndrome that I couldn't manage Excel or something that, but I felt I was a fraud as a person. And instead of having a strong inner healthy sense of self, most childhood trauma survivors, I had to come up with something a good enough substitute, which is a good enough substitute. Maintaining a healthy sense of self isn't an easy task. The fundamental five reasons is, first, that one guy with a guilty conscience always knows where his pride has gone. The one guy who has known him for 12 months thought that he'd be high again that's what was happening around him. I quickly went and it really helped me through some terrible years. It sort of still helps me and I still love them. In my late teens, I played in drums in indie bands and clubs and being pretty good at it, I thought that was my identity and I thought that was my sense of self. , hi, I'm Patrick, I play drums. Playing drums for me and getting attention from it felt having a life vest in a sea of anxiety and doubt about feeling a fraud at life otherwise.

    "output": "But I'm grateful for having that ability to play music because it kept me buoyant and not having any internal resources. If I had a great night at a show, then I had value. If I made a mistake at a show, then I would get super neurotic or needy about it and I lost any sense of goodness, which is the theme to this video. Many childhood trauma survivors find that same kind of life vest of value in things , say, sex or appearance or work or being an artist or being a rebel or being super achieving. We find something, but it's not fully who we are. It's just a part of who we are and valuing ourselves based on what we do solely always ends up empty and our worth is kind of conditional and fluid. Goodness doesn't really stick, and those conditions, only good performances, and even those are fleeting. Again, we don't really have a foundation of worth beyond of what we do, and I think that's a problem in society. just to be clear, not having a strong sense of self doesn't mean you're totally vacant or empty. There is enough really in there to build upon, and it's important to not confuse symptoms of numbness with not having any sense of self at all, and I'll get into that later. Let's define a sense of self. Many childhood trauma survivors struggle with things identity, personality, and sense of self because there's a lot of overlap between those three things. to differentiate between those three things, let's start with identity. Identity are things that we identify with, ranging from values to politics and music. One can view identity as things that we're aligned with on our insides and our interests and our values. Personality, which we're born with, is something that has to be identified with. Personality is something that we're born with, and a healthy family system and healthy attachment helps us develop our inner nature that we come out in the world with. Personality traits as infants and toddlers can range from things spiritedness to being easygoing, to being a rule follower, to being shy, to being cautious, and we're born with a lot that can either be nurtured or can be lost. Check out a video that I did on trauma personality versus our real personality.",

    "output": "I'll have that link in the description. the third thing, sense of self, which is our focus, is what I would say is a foundational awareness of one's identity and personality, and inherent goodness and also having some power, which can come from the place of self-love and self-acceptance. I know that's a mouthful, and being raised to be allowed those two things, goodness and power. If we're loved as kids, we can love ourselves, which becomes an inner reserve, and some power can come from that. Goodness being things worth, integrity, dignity. You can think of those things as the opposite of shame, which will always be an elevated issue for those of us who grew up in childhood trauma. And I also have a very detailed video about childhood trauma-based shame. Lots of things go on in the description. I'll put a video link there on shame. To show you what I mean, as a side note, when, say, a three-year-old is told that they are bad or that they're not lovable, or an abusive parent is giving them horrific feedback, a child's goodness is gone, or a child's goodness is gone from them. And that can feel , for them, a life and death experience that's big. It's telling them that they're unlovable when being lovable is their whole world of safety for their own development, that concept, being good. And that idea about it being a life and death experience for a really small child is something that I feel is missing from the DSM when they talk about PTSD in terms of life and death experiences. They don't really talk about that in terms of a child view. In life and death experiences, they don't really talk about that in terms of a child view. They don't really talk about that in terms of a child view. And that lack of goodness in our adulthood through our abuse conditioning is often what we feel when we assume that we don't have the to defend ourselves because we don't have that goodness. Or we overly defend, when we take things way too personally, we're defending that lack of goodness. Or we tend to be in a fight response when triggered when we're really defending. We can also name that as shame.",

    "output": "Building a sense of self is a process much when we develop through childhood that leads to this psych concept called individuation which means to fully become distinct from other things while being able to be part of the world. You are your own person. It doesn't mean you can't do intimacy or you're a loner. You're able to maintain your sense of self while you're in relationships. You don't lose yourself around others we see when we were going through childhood trauma. the important part of being part of a community is that we can actually practice intimacy and being part of. My biggest healing moment in my life really was in a long term childhood trauma group that I often reference when I was about 20. A fellow member who I triggered, and we actually because of that trigger we did some conflict work together with the help of a therapist and the end result of that was the person I triggered simply said to me you're a good person. And that conflict was about me showing up in my trauma self or my inauthentic self and I would unintentionally minimize people's feelings because when people were upset I feel I was responsible for the upset and also responsible for fixing it. I really didn't have the ability to just sit with someone's pain. I would try to immediately get you out of that pain which really invalidates your pain to begin with. conflict can be terrifying but in safe places with a skilled group therapist I mentioned can really lead to some powerful changes in authenticity. hearing you're a good person really changed my life because I had this really unconscious assumption that I was not a good person. Unnamed, never really thought about it. But because of my childhood trauma that's really the way that I operated in the world. And being a good person stuck with me. And I had, it's I had new info that changed everything in my life. And it says a lot about what happens to someone who grows up in childhood trauma that's incredibly shame based. Having no concept of goodness or power. power is the byproduct of our goodness. And that's often the problem where we're missing huge chunks of foundation inside that will get us through life in a good way of being a good person.",

    "output": "The question I get is, Irene, how do I start. And you'll probably have that question today as I talk about how trauma is really released. We'll define what trauma is, we'll define what release actually means. It's not what we often think it is. And I just wanted to start off with that. I am a somatic experiencing practitioner. I'm also a Feldenkrais practitioner, and I'm trained in something called somatic practice. And I have two science degrees, one in exercise physiology and one, a master's of research in biomedical and health science. this is my world. This is my expertise. I've been doing this work since I graduated from high school in 1993. wanted to just give that little overview for those who are new to me. this concept of how do we, first of all, what is trauma. What is release. And how do we really release trauma. And how do we really release trauma. And how do we really release trauma. And how do we really release trauma from the body. And to get into this, I first need to define trauma from this, we would call it new traumatology point of view. the new traumatology point of view or way of looking at the human system is really been birthed and born out of my predecessors, most of which are still alive, namely Peter Levine. Robert Scare, Bessel van der Kolk, Kathy Kane, people that have really understood and have worked in clinical practice and teaching others me how to work in their practices, that trauma isn't something that is within the event. It's not the car accident. It's not the attack. It's not the injustice. It is what happens in the physiology. And I'm also going to make one distinction, I am open to all sorts of different ways of talking and using verbiage. If you were to go to the hospital, because you got into a car accident, again, for example, you would most likely and if you needed surgery, you might see a trauma surgeon. those surgeons or those places in hospitals, the trauma wing, if you think of shows Grey's Anatomy, yes, that is they're treating. The body and the body had a hurt or an accident due to an event, and therefore they are helping with those traumas. That's one way in the medical world of defining a trauma.",

    "output": "The other thing that I didn't mention about the autonomic nervous system is it not only governs the fight, flight, freeze, it also is in charge of how we digest things. if I drink a bit of water here, if you've got a drink next to you, you can do the same and imagine this. I don't have to teach myself how to swallow. I don't have to teach my body how to bring that water and that liquid through my stomach, through my intestine, small intestine. I don't need to. It just happens automatically. Thank goodness,. That is, that is automatic the autonomic nervous system is responsible for that stuff what goes on in our system. It's responsible for our hormone release, how our immune system keeps us safe, and protects us from whatever is within and around us. It is responsible for our heart rate shifting and changing. Our blood pressure, our respirato-, our respiration,. If we start to climb up, up, up, because when lekker says, to climb up a flight of stairs. We need to start our increase, , increase in our respiration, inhale, exhale, blood pressure goes up to meet the demands of the act, movement, task that we are doing. automatic nervous system, autonomic nervous system is just what we need. The thing that's interesting is that when we have got things that occur to us, we typically call them traumas. I had an emotional trauma, I had a physical trauma, I had a sexual trauma, I had a medical trauma, all these things. That's fine, I think it's fine to say that, but I'm trying to be a little more accurate in defining, is it a trauma or is it the system is dysregulated as a result of that event or that series of event or the generational past. Or the abuse. I prefer the word abuse to trauma because someone may have a certain type of abuse and then another person has the exact same type and how they deal with those different hardships, shocks to their system, abuses, scary, bad thing, it is determined by how their internal physiology and how their autonomic nervous system was originally wired when they were young.",

This idea of trauma, again, in my suite of words and how I describe this, it's not something that's in the event, it's how it ends up in the system, whether it is what we would call dysregulation, somatic stress, and also know that when trauma and trapped stress, these fight, flight, freeze responses, just little í at the start, the most powerful surprise, is that hearings are often useful for all of our emotional muscle networks, including our heart s, heart Randy, our lymph nodes, and we call itilia. relationships over and over again. For some, it is none of the above, but it's constantly self-sabotaging ourselves and feeling we're no good or we have no purpose in life, et cetera, et cetera. just to wrap that one up before I get to the release part, trauma is something that is not necessarily, in my opinion and from my experience in the event, it is how an individual acts, responds, feels, processes the outside bad, scary thing that happened, and then whether or not that gets stuck and embedded in the system. Now, if we think about something really simple, let's just say you, and this is my common go-to example. You're walking in your home and you stub your toe on a coffee table or something on the ground, and it hurts hell. In that moment, that very benign, but I've broken a toe doing that, it can really hurt. The system goes into a stress response. It goes into a sense of something's not. Oh gosh, there's a piece of bone that got broken, or maybe there's a ligament that got broken. It's a lot of stress. It's a lot of stress. It's a lot of stress. Again, you don't have to think, send out the army to protect and send the blood cells that it starts to stitch up the bone or the tendon or the cut.",

I have to change myself to take care of mom, dad, grandma, grandpa, nanny, whatever it might be, older sibling. Even if that child is an infant and can't make sense of what's going on, they will shift their physiology to protect themselves from the outburst that their caregiver has put out. this is kind of one of those caveats where depending on the age of the child, to help them not take the stress of our trauma, traumas, events, bad, scary things, hurts, harms, et cetera, we have to then maybe process that later. And that is as simple as having a moment later that day or the next day where we conjure up the memory of that accident, harm, hurt, and we work with our physiology to track the things that we might've trapped inside. Now, this is more advanced, and this is of course, what we work with and we teach our students in our programs. But I just wanted to give you that concept that sometimes we can't work on something in the moment. It might not be safe to do. Maybe it's a more serious accident and we have to go immediately to emergency and we've passed out and we have to get something fixed. But then after the fact, that's when we want to then work with our physiology, track it, see what's stored, what is suppressed, what is de-pressed in the system. , just following me here, I started with defining what trauma is. I gave you a very brief introduction to the autonomic nervous system. I gave you this example of stubbing our toe as a little minor, we would call this shock trauma, and how being able to process and feel what is going on will allow us to come out of that high intensity shock state. Now, the next question might be, , do I have to shake. Do I need to do this. And this is where this gets really interesting and there's much misinformation out there.

But if we are no longer in the traumatic stress, if we're no longer in the event that occurred 20 years ago, 30 years ago, 40 years ago, or even generationally to our ancestors, if we're not in that anymore, but we still have that, we're not in that, we're not in that, we're not in that, we're not in that, we're not in that, and we still have the wiring in our noggin up here to protect us, we need to do some work to help bring back more qualities of sensation to the body.

Zusammenf counts. \" and the past is still on your back a backpack, the ability for the system to deal with that cut or that broken bone or that shock trauma, let's just say, is less able. It can still do it, but it's going to take a lot of time for that cut, let's just say, to heal. And I know this from speaking with people who have autoimmune conditions, who are chronically stressed, who are living in what we would call chronic PTSD, which is the fight, flight, and the parasympathetic freeze just on all the time, their autonomic healing repair mechanisms are dampened. They are under stress because the system is trying to just keep them safe. Even though there's no danger around them, there is a message saying, danger, danger, danger.",

The water is healthy. The water isn't filled with toxins. Do we just give the fish medicine and then plop it back into the environment that's toxic, or do we clean up the environment and then let the fish respond to a cleaner environment, and over time it starts to heal. I'm sort of laying that idea that would be called terrain theory, for example, where we change the terrain. We change what we're offering the fish for its nutrients and its goodness, its home. for humans, when we have a cut, for example, I'm going to pull this back together. Don't worry, guys. When we have a cut on our hand and our system is already under stress, it's going to take a lot longer for that cut to heal because the system is trying to figure out what it should fight next. Who should I attack today. What should I forget. What should I disconnect from today. And it doesn't know how to address just that thing and go into healing mode. all of that, let that settle. For us here today, I will make the assumption that many of you are here because you have old traumas, old survival stress. Your system is living in some form of fight, flight, freeze, some form of maybe dissociation, which is also called derealization, depersonalization, disconnection from the environment. We aren't able to even see what's around us. We're kind of a walking zombie. Or the flip side, we are hyper aroused. We are hyper vigilant. We are always looking for the next thing to attack us.

Usually it's the mother, but sometimes it's a father, sometimes it's a grandparent or a nanny doesn't matter. Whoever that responsible, older human was for us when we were young, if they didn't have solid regulation on board, they won't know how to attune to us. And then we will learn faulty attunement to ourselves. That's really important. Let me say that again. If our primary caregiver doesn't know how to listen to their own physiology because of their own trapped stuff, and then they can't listen to their own, they can't understand us, and they're not helping us co-regulate and soothe, we then get faulty information about how to soothe our own autonomic system. This is what we would call one portion of early developmental pre-verbal trauma. in that case, there's no actual one event. There isn't that one car accident. There isn't that one attack. There isn't that one natural disaster that obliterated the village that I was growing up in. For example, it's this low level insidious, always feeding the little one what it needs to do to survive.

It has to match up, the languages have to talk to each other, because it's just not gonna work. to match up the languages have to talk to each other, because it's just not gonna up the because this is what happens guys and gals. If the languages don't talk to each other, we might feel better after that release, after that big cathartic cry, because there's more blood flow, there's more endorphins. It opens up our joints. We feel less tension. We feel a little more powerful. But if those things didn't match up, that imprint of how we wanted to fight, the essence, the smell of the cigarette smoke, the cologne, the alcohol, if we don't have that come up, we're not fully resolving that event. Hope that makes sense. I would not ask anyone to try to process an event that before they've done weeks and weeks of groundwork. In my programs, we never ask anyone, what are your traumas. We never ask them, how were you attacked. What did you not get to fight off. What occurred. We don't go into the injustices. It's not important when we're laying the groundwork. They know what happened to them. We don't need to bring it back up, but they know what happened to them. We know that we're teaching them the language of their nervous system that when that old event finally feels safe, this is a key word I haven't mentioned yet today.",

If we talk about the chance we give to the militiamen to survive in a modern combat, we are not ready. We have to give them material, which is modern material, which can protect them and give them a chance to be at the same level as a potential enemy. Today, this is not the case. We no longer have the capacity to assume. We no longer have the capacity to assume. We no longer have the capacity to assume. We no longer have the capacity to assume. In Europe, no country today has the defense capacity to face the new risks and threats that come with the Russian aggression and its stance on the European continent. Peace cannot be guaranteed on our continent itself. Beyond Ukraine. The Russian threat is there and it's hitting European countries. It's hitting us. The time of comfort has changed. We all know that. If Europe wants to survive, it must be armed. In Switzerland, our army lacks modern equipment, weapons, ammunition, and equipment to accomplish its defence mission on complex battlefields. Worse, at the beginning of the year, our defence ministry has just gone through one of the most serious crises in its history, with resignations and scandals to the scent of fraud and corruption. The Swiss are watching over a sector of the national exhibition whose materials symbolize our defence. It was a time when the Swiss army was at its peak. We are in Lausanne at the national exhibition of 1960. In the middle of a cold war, the government gives priority to defence and the army supports the Swiss who are pressing into its pavilion. Inside, a quasi-Hollywood film celebrates our armed forces. Our country has more than 600,000 active soldiers, 300 fighter planes, and 800 combat tanks. The bridge is ready. The tank regiment 2 is starting to cross. What are some simple things to add. We have more than 600,000 artillery systems. We show the public the training for urban combat with flamethrowers.",

Australia. Japan. Israel. Or Switzerland. Today, Viola Amert and her project manager, Darko Savic, have resigned. It is impossible to have their point of view. It should be noted that the former head of the F-35 program, the former head of the DDPS, was under intense pressure, and not only because of the choice of the F-35. A month before his resignation, in mid-December, she received a alarming letter. It was signed by the Parliamentary Finance Delegation, in charge of the financial surveillance of the great projects of the Confederation. It concerns 20 key projects of the DDPS, including the Israeli drones, but also other priority projects, such as the new radar system. Recent reports on key projects of the DDPS have allowed the Finance Delegation to notice with great concern that the state of these projects has deteriorated. These 20 projects represent 19 billion francs. In comparison, it is more than three times the price of the F-35s. we are not counting peanuts. What a shame for the President of the Finance Delegation, the UDC's National Councilor, Lars Guglisberg. It is about effectively using the money of the contributors. The relationship between expenses and benefits must be favorable. We must use the money of the contributors with care, and it is our role to supervise this. The delegation targets in particular projects linked to the digital transformation of the army. The project is a project that is in the process of being completed. We were very concerned because all these projects have deteriorated. In other words, the risks have increased. There are several reasons for this. There were internal reasons, that is, internal governance did not work. There were also tensions between the different actors. The complexity of the projects was poorly evaluated. And then, of course, there were external factors. For example, delivery problems, quality defects, especially due to the geopolitical situation. This led to delays afterwards. And that is why we decided to write this letter. , basically, there is a bit of everything that has deteriorated.",

Except that nothing happens as expected. The tanks are stored in northern Italy for years. In 2023, the German press reveals that RUAG tried to sell some of them to a German company for 500 euros, when it had bought them for 45,000 euros. But the case is also in chaos. This is why the Federal Office of Arms is concerned about the Confederation's financial gendarmes. During a first audit, we found that many transactions had been carried out and that they simply made no sense. Rent contracts were concluded that made no sense. This is what led us to carry out other checks in 2024. This is only the beginning, indeed. At the end of February, the Federal Office of Arms presented three devastating reports on RUAG.

She was trapped in a system. She was trapped in a system where she had no income, no savings and therefore no perspective on a life in freedom. The psychiatric supervision for the trial by Dr. Adelheid Kastner drew the picture of a heavily disturbed but completely predictable man. The diagnosis was a severe personality disorder characterized by a strong urge to dominate and control other people. He was treated as an emotional enemy. He was treated as a person of ill-will. His motive was a mixture of sexual obsession and the desire to control Elisabeth Fritzl. The decisive factor was the determination of the guilt. Fritzl knew exactly what he did and he knew that it was wrong. His crime was the result of a cold, calculating will, not an uncontrollable drive. He was the architect, the planner and the foreman in a person. A man who not only dreamed hell, but also built it with his own hands. While the Fritzl family lived in their everyday life, far from home, only a few meters under their feet existed a second, cruel cosmos. The Masmora that Joseph Fritzl created was not an ordinary cellar. It was a fortress of isolation. A thought-through prison built for the complete destruction of human will. Every centimeter was proof of his sickly control. The construction of this horror cellar was a long-standing project that began at the end of the 1970s. Fritzl, a learned electrical engineer, used his technical knowledge miserably. The access was through a series of eight doors, of which the last was a steel door weighing 300 kilograms, reinforced with concrete and secured by an electronic code that only he knew. To camouflage the construction work, which required the removal of tons of earth, he officially applied for a permit and even received state funding for the construction of an air defense bunker, a usual precautionary measure in the time of the Cold War. Later, he hid further renovations behind the construction of a swimming pool in the garden. The perfidious irony, while the family bathed upstairs in the garden, his daughter lay down in the darkness. The decisive moment was the death of Fritzl.",

It was the door that she was to cut off from the world for the next 24 years. As soon as she was down, he put her in a rag with ether, tied her and began her martyrdom. To explain her disappearance, he forced her to write a letter in which she claimed to have joined a sect and not to be sought after. A lie that was equally swallowed up by family and authorities. Life in the 60 square meters of the prison was a constant fight for dignity and psychological survival. There was no daylight. The air was stuffy and muddy. Elisabeth was systematically raped almost every day for years. Fritzl practiced his courage. Fritzl practiced his control not only through physical barriers, but also through psychological terror. He claimed that the doors would be secured with poison gas or explosives that would kill her and her children if they attempted to escape. This created a climate of constant fear and absolute subversion. In this microcosm, Fritzl was an unrestricted dictator who was able to survive and kill with all resources, food, water, electricity, and the. The economic dimension of this prison was omnipresent and humiliating. Elisabeth and her children were dependent on the arbitrary contributions of their patron. There was no way to earn their own money or to own their own simple economic goods. Every meal was a gift from their master, every piece of clothing a sign of his generosity. This absolute financial dependence was one of the strongest invisible chains that bound her to him and staked every hope of autonomy in the germ. In this hell, Elisabeth brought seven children to the world, all brought by her own father. Fritzl cruelly divided them up into two boxes. Three children, Lisa, Monika and Alexander, he adopted by laying them down in front of the house door as babies and with falsified letters from Elisabeth claimed that, they could not care for them. They grew up in a seemingly normal world, believing that their mother had left them. The other three, Kerstin, Stefan and Felix, remained in the cellar until their whole life was liberated.

The answer is not in supernatural genius, but in the perfidious exploitation of social norms, bureaucratic gaps and the human tendency to overlook the obvious. Joseph Fritzl was a master of deception, who hid his monstrosity behind the mask of the bitter patriarch. His lie building was complex and long-term. The central pillar was the story of Elizabeth's alleged sect contribution. Over the years he produced letters regularly, which he forced Elizabeth to write. These letters, which were not sought in the sect and their request to change their lives, were described in detail, were accepted by the family and the authorities as authentic. They were the proof of their alleged decision to lead a life away from the family and stung every suspicion in the germ. His handling of the three children he brought out of the cell was even more cunning. He always staged the same theater. A baby was laid off in front of the house door, accompanied by a heart-wrenching letter by the allegedly overwhelmed Elizabeth, in which she asked the grandparents to take care of the child. The authorities, who believed this story, even gave him and Rosemarie the official pretext. In a particularly treacherous act, Fritzl even imitated the voice of his captured daughter in 1994 in a phone call to Rosemarie to announce the arrival of one of the children. This was not a simple lie, but an elaborate psychological manipulation program. The role of his wife Rosemarie is of crucial importance.",

    "output": "Her path demonstrates that human resistance can even overcome the deepest hell. Elisabeth's transformation from a prisoner to the guardian of her family is proof of the indestructible human will. Her children, who had to learn what it means to be free, show us that healing is possible, even if the scars remain. The economic perspective in this case reveals another dimension of abuse. Fritzl's total control over the financial resources was an essential component of his power. Today's financial independence of the survivors therefore symbolizes not only economic stability, but also their final victory over the mechanisms of their oppression. They have regained the economy of their lives. What can we take from this story. That we as a society must be more vigilant, that bureaucracy must never be over humanity, that we must give the weak a voice, and that even in the deepest darkness, hope is not erased. The case of Fritzl is a painful, but necessary reminder of our responsibility for each other and the invincible power of the human spirit, which can even survive the worst nightmares. The case of Josef Fritzl will forever remain as one of the darkest chapters in the history of crime. But beyond the shock and horror, this tragedy offers profound insights into human nature, the structures of our society and the tenacity of hope. What remains when the dust has settled. First, this case confronts us with the disturbing truth that evil often has a familiar face. Josef Fritzl was not a foreign monster, but a neighbor, a family member, a respected member of the community. His story teaches us that we must not let our vigilance be tainted by appearances. The facade of normality can hide the most profound truths, and it is our collective responsibility to look where others look away. The systemic failures in the case of Fritzl show the dangerous gaps in our security networks. The incriminating of his former conviction of rape from the criminal register, the superficial examination by the youth authorities, the willing acceptance of his lies, all these were pieces of the puzzle, which enabled his crimes. The case forces us to question our bureaucratic processes and to recognize that rules alone are not enough to protect people. It takes a healthy human understanding, skepticism and the courage to ask uncomfortable questions.",

It's the stuff that people are really having a hard time processing and dealing with. , I think when I started over 20 years ago, I started in a residential treatment center. And we had about 10 clients at a time and did group therapy, one on one counseling, psycho educational classes. I was working with clients all day long every day teaching or counseling or doing group therapy. And what I quickly began to realize was a couple things. Number one, most of them had were coming off the streets, drugs, prison, Pulmonary, things that, and a lot of them had minimal education. And really to be effective with them, I had to kind of put it on the lowest shelf, they could get access to the goods. And I had to dumb it down in my mind and put it in language that they could understand, and often colloquial language was part of that. But secondly, what I saw, with most of the treatment that was going on, at that time, is they did a lot of treatment that was out there because ultimately they wanted to get mostly advice. I had a group therapy. lot of good work, important work, but it was very much symptoms, helping people regulate.",

And it's , I got to be able to put into words simply, but yet clearly and directly the real issues for people. And what I saw when I was able to start doing that was people really welcomed it. Finally, somebody is being honest with us. Somebody is helping us understand it. But then I saw people really starting to grow and change because now they had tools to actually change the deep issues, the real issues. And it just really validated that this was the way to go in helping people. And it just kind of developed from that. It's just grown from there. When you talk about complex trauma, I think it would be beneficial. We always have to remember, cause we're in this space all the time, all day, every day, we're kind of constantly working it together. We've both now, we've both been in this space, we've navigated, meaning we've gone through therapy together. We've done a bunch of work over the course of our relationship, but we always have to remember that not everybody listening has. if you wouldn't mind, take a moment to kind of break down what would be the difference between what you would kind of classify as just regular trauma from life that everybody kind of gets and experiences over the course of life through childhood and adulthood and everything that versus complex trauma. , two ways that I would try to help people understand it. the first is when we think of trauma, we usually think of what I call big T trauma, and that's a horrific event that's out of the normal. And , , there is that element of trauma and then, but there's also little T trauma and little T trauma is what we would refer to as neglect trauma. it's not something bad happening to you.",

    "input": "What should someone know about complex trauma and how it affects their relationships and healing?",
    "output": "It's something good that should have happened. It's something that should have happened to you that's not happening to you. And that has just as much of a negative effect on a child as big T trauma, because when somebody is not there for you to meet your needs, to protect you, to comfort you, to validate you, to connect with you, all of a sudden you feel what's wrong with me. The world's not safe. I'm all on my own. I don't belong. I don't fit in. I'm bad. All kinds of different things that have the exact same effect on you. And , , I think it's important to have that same message that comes out of big T trauma. that's the initial distinction is kind of when we talk about trauma, it's big T and little T trauma that has to be looked at. And what we know is that about 75 of Americans and Canadians have little T trauma, but don't even know they have it. And it's the more common trauma, but it's the least understood and talked about trauma, because we've put much energy into understanding big T trauma. But then the second thing is, usually when we think of trauma, we think of one-time horrific events. Complex trauma is what happens when those horrific events are happening every day, and the child can't resolve it. Now that becomes complex trauma. It's ongoing, continual danger, lack of safety, because needs aren't being met or because I'm being hurt, and the child can't resolve it. And as a result of that, it's a lot of trauma. And I think it's important to understand the underlying, the underlying reason why these big T trauma is important to us. For example, they have to try to adapt to survive. They have to develop behaviors and ways of coping, which are all versions of fight, flight, or freeze, or fawn, as their only ways of surviving, because no healthy tools are working. And they set up a whole coping system that keeps them safe physically as a child. But when they get to adult life, this adaptation becomes a maladaptation. It no longer. is working. It's destroying relationships. It's messing up jobs. It's messing them up. And complex trauma is adaptations to survive because of ongoing danger that become maladaptations in adult life.",

They got them validation. They kept them safe. And they thought, , this is the way to go. And then 40 years later, their marriage is falling apart. Their kids hate them. All of those things are happening. And they go, what's going on here. What's wrong. And it's this delayed consequence of 20 to 40 years before you realize the complex trauma now is coming home to roost in a very negative way. And we can attest to that. I mean, quite literally, we met when we were both in our 30s. barely 30. We were coming off of our first marriages. our first marriages were coming to an end. We were both in law enforcement. I was a police officer and Stephanie was a dispatcher. And we had all of these kind of surface level things that we were addressing and kind of navigating. And then at some point, it was a few years into our relationship, it almost felt the wheels just started to really come off. And since then, it has been. this massive unpacking of looking at all of the complex trauma that we both had almost no awareness of to some extent,. We each had individual examples, I guess, of stories that we could recount and experiences that we had. But it's been really eye-opening the more that we kind of have unpacked it and gone into it. And one of the things that we really wanted to kind of talk to you about, not only for our own benefit, selfishly, but we also feel it's one of those things that is really not just common, but also not really talked about a whole lot, is the dynamic of codependency and what that actually looks to try to unpack it in a relationship. Because that's what we've been trying to do, Tim, even just unconsciously, I think, for the last several years and more consciously recently, is looking at the ways that we have been codependent with one another and what that has actually really looked.

And you base it not on your internal sense of who you are, but you now base it on your externals, your money, your possessions, your position, the trophy on your arm, all of those types of things that now determine your value and how important you are. part of why it's important to start there for me is narcissism has really kind of been, , I've been in a lot of situations where I've been in a lot of situations where I've been in a lot of situations where I've been in a lot of situations where I've been in a lot of situations where I've been in a lot of situations where I've been pathologized as you're just bad.

Now they had to compensate for it. usually that comes out of, and this is important to understand is complex trauma within a home usually has one of the parents who is a narcissist. They want everything to suit them. They want to be the boss. They want everybody to meet their needs, but they're not concerned in using their power and authority to meet the needs of others. They just want their own way. They want everything to suit them. And the child is giving up their needs to accommodate a narcissist. Their child is trying to please a narcissist. And a lot of the adaptations and the trauma come from a narcissist, but the child is learning to respond to a narcissist, but something else is also happening. They're developing a subconscious brain template that says I'm developing skills to live with a narcissist. And this is now my normal. And this feels actually normal. This is my default.

At first, they're kind of doing what they can to meet each other's needs, but they're not getting their own needs met. Their shame is preventing them from being authentic. Their shame is preventing them from actually receiving love. And they're not satisfied.

And they're on their best fear of abandonment. And they're on their best fear of abandonment. And they're on their best fear of abandonment. But then when it starts to break down, they start to panic. Oh, this relationship is going to fall apart. I'll be abandoned. I can't have that. let's get back on our best behavior. the relationship starts to follow a cycle. There's a bit of a blow up.

The emotions are I feel less than, but that then leads to I need to beat myself up. I need to put myself down. And if I fail, the way to change my behavior is not to be compassionate to myself and forgive myself. It's to be hard on myself. It's to tear myself down.

Would you say that. I mean, I don't want to say that's every codependent relationship, but is it pretty common that those behaviors are going to be playing out in that way. Or are there other contributing factors and other kind of dances that people will have in codependency that don't necessarily have that dynamic of the narcissist and the co-narcissist. , I'm glad you raised it because there's important qualifiers. That need to be brought into this discussion because it's not this black and white narcissist, co-narcissist. a couple of the qualifiers is that in most relationships, each partner can be a co-narcissist and a narcissist. It depends on the day. It depends on what the triggers are. And they tend to fluctuate. It's very rarely that you have a relationship where it's the same person is always the narcissist. The same person is always. The co-narcissist. It can fluctuate. Really. Yes. that. That alone is blowing my mind now to think about it that way, where. That's. Say more. Sorry. I was , hold on a minute. what can happen with the co-narcissist is they give, give, give, give, give, but they never receive back. And they begin to get a huge resentment. And one day they explode. And if you don't smarten up and if you don't start being considerate. Considered of me, then I'm leaving you. And they, they, they give a, and it's not an idle threat, but they give a threat. All of a sudden the narcissist, they're panicking.",

First of all, is for most people, codependency and shame is totally subconscious. you're living out behaviors and not even aware you think your motives are this when you really don't know that the motivation is a deeper shame motivation. And that's very important to understand. It's a subconscious thing that we tell ourself often different messages about what's happening than what the truth really is about what's happening. But the second thing is a shame based person who's who's gone to the inferior. I'm less than I'm going to their only way of trying to they could meet somebody super healthy. And their only way of knowing how to make connection is I need to take care of your needs. I need to be there for you. I need to give it myself to help you. they show up and give the person a coffee. They show up and can I help you with this. their basic approach to relationships is I have to give in order to get. And I have to put myself in a servant. Role in order to get any attraction. they're not necessarily looking for a narcissist. They're just looking for relationship and it could be with a healthy person and they try to push them to the narcissist position because that's how they know how to relate. And the other person depending on how healthy they are they can get they can fall into that and go this feels good to get all this attention. And before it the relationship. Set up. Inferior superior. Because the codependent needed. To set the other person is superior in order to feel. They're doing it. And that happens with many people without them even realizing that they're doing it because to them they're just being a kind person when they meet the person can I get you a coffee can I do this for you can I help you. Oh if you have any just phone me I'll be glad to come and help you. And they. Set. Up a relationship. Early on where they're. Serving serving never asking. And no boundaries never saying no.

Is it that super clear. again, important qualifying point. to me, there's two definitions that people really need to understand around narcissism. there's the DSM, narcissistic personality disorder.

What I'm talking about is that, and you end up with relationships that, that are very codependent. But what I'm talking about is the majority of the times, it's narcissistic tendencies. And that's very different from a pure narcissist. everybody coming out of complex trauma has narcissistic tendencies. Because what did I have to do to survive. I had to put my needs ahead of yours. And when my limbic brain is triggered by fear or danger, the emotional survival part of my brain is triggered, I go into fight, flight, freeze, and it's all about me. It's all about surviving. And I, when I'm in my limbic brain, act very narcissistic. And to me, when you look at borderline personality disorder, basically, it's very similar to shame based person who can act very loving and be very loving 95 of the time. But when their fear of abandonment or their shame gets triggered, they become a narcissist. All of a sudden, they're a different person. And it's , Whoa, where did that come from. And that to me is kind of important distinction is everybody coming out of complex trauma has narcissistic tendencies. But they don't normally show up unless something has triggered fear or shame or stress in your brain that sends you into that survival response. And then the narcissistic tendencies come up. that's where when a person's in fear or anger or stress, all of a sudden, they expect more of everybody else. You got to be perfect. You got to do this for me, what I want. Don't argue with me, blah, blah, blah. And it's , Whoa, this is a narcissist just showed up here.

    "output": "When people think about trauma, they often think of memories, of painful images or haunting recollections that linger in the mind. But trauma is not simply what happened to you. Trauma is what happens inside you as a result of what happened to you. It is not the event itself, but the imprint it leaves on your body, your brain, and your nervous system. Trauma changes how you live, how you breathe, how you relate to others, and how safe you feel in your own skin. In my decades of work with trauma survivors, from war veterans to abused children to victims of chronic neglect, one truth has emerged consistently. Trauma is not just remembered, it is relived. Over and over the body reactivates, the nervous system floods, and the world once again feels unsafe even when danger is long gone. This is the essence of survival mode, when your body keeps reacting as if the trauma is still happening, even years after it has passed. Healing from trauma then is not about forgetting the past or simply processing a painful memory. Healing requires creating a sense of safety in the present. It requires helping to heal, and it requires a sense of safety in the present. It requires helping to heal, and it requires a sense of calmness, and it requires a sense of connection. The body learns that it is no longer in danger. That process begins not with words, but with regulation. With restoring a sense of calm, grounding, and connection. Because you cannot reason your way out of survival mode, you can't simply tell yourself you're safe, not when every cell in your body believes otherwise. We live in a culture that often tells us to just move on, to stop dwelling on the past. But for trauma survivors, the past is not past. It's present. It's in the flinch when someone raises their voice. It's in the panic that arises for no apparent reason. It's in the inability to trust, to relax, to feel at home in one's body. Trauma survivors don't need to be told to move on. They need to be helped back into their bodies. They need to feel safe again, perhaps for the very first time. When we're in survival mode, everything changes. Our priorities shift from growth, curiosity, and exploration to vigilance, control, and avoidance. We stop learning.",

    "output": "If you feel your body is always bracing for impact, if you struggle to relax, trust, or feel joy, if you find yourself numb, anxious, or disconnected from the world around you, this message is for you. Healing is possible, but not through willpower alone, not by trying harder. The first step is not toughness, but safety. The kind of safety that allows your body to stop fighting, to stop fleeing, to stop freezing. Only then can you begin to heal. Let's begin this journey by understanding what survival mode really is, and how it shows up in your body and brain. Because before we can exit it, we have to know we're in it. When the human brain perceives danger, it doesn't ask for your permission. It reacts instantly, automatically, and powerfully. This reaction is what we call survival mode, and it governs much of what we do when we're under threat. For many trauma survivors, this state becomes a permanent operating system, not just a temporary emergency response. Survival mode is not just one thing. It comes in several forms, each rooted in evolution and designed to protect us. You've likely heard of the fight-or-flight response. But there's more. There's freeze. We're in it. It's where your body shuts down and goes numb. And there's fawn, where you appease others in order to stay safe. These four responses, fight, flight, freeze, and fawn, are all part of the body's effort to survive overwhelming experiences. Let's start with fight. This is when your body mobilizes to confront the danger. It's the pounding heart, the clenched fists, the surge of adrenaline that says, I have to protect myself. It can show up in trauma survivors as irritability, rage, and a tendency to overreact to small provocations. These individuals aren't being irrational. They're stuck in a loop where their body believes it's still fighting for survival. Flight is the need to escape. The heart races, muscles tense, eyes scan for exits. It can show up later in life as anxiety, restlessness, or a chronic need to stay busy. People who are stuck in flight mode may seem hyperproductive or can't relax because stillness feels dangerous. When you're always running, you don't have to feel the fear that's chasing you. Freeze is the body's last resort. When neither fighting nor fleeing will work, the brain shuts everything down. This is not weakness.",

    "output": "It's in your startled response, your hypervigilance, your inability to rest. when I work with trauma survivors, my first priority is not asking them to recount the story. It's helping their nervous system find a sense of safety, often for the first time. That might involve grounding techniques, body-based practices, or simply learning how to notice sensations without being overwhelmed by them. We are not rushing into the past. We are building the resources to tolerate the present. It's important to remember that survival mode is not a choice. It's not a sign of weakness. It's not a moral failure. It's a deeply intelligent response to danger, one that worked at the time. And maybe saved your life. But what saved you then is now costing you dearly. Your relationships, your peace, your capacity for joy, all can be compromised when your body is locked in survival. But there is hope. The brain is plastic. The nervous system can be rewired. You can teach your body, slowly, gently, that it's safe to let go. And once safety is restored, real healing becomes possible. You move from survival mode. From surviving to living.

When something deeply frightening or overwhelming happens to us, and we're unable to process it at the time, either because we were too young, or because we were too helpless, or too shocked, that experience doesn't disappear. It gets embedded. It leaves a record. Not in your conscious mind, but in your body's tissues, in your muscles, in your nervous system. Trauma shows up as tight shoulders you can never seem to relax. A gut that twists at the smallest sign of stress. Or a pounding heart that seems to react before you even understand why. It appears in your mind. It appears in your posture. In the way you walk into a room. In how close you allow someone to stand next to you. It affects your sleep, your digestion, your immune system, your hormones. This is why many trauma survivors have chronic physical symptoms that doctors can't explain. They are not imagining it. Their body is reliving something it never got to resolve.",

    "output": "When we experience trauma, especially early in life, our brain makes a decision. Survival first, everything else later. Logical thought, language and memory are turned down. Instead, the body gears up for fight, flight, freeze or fawn. The amygdala, our brain's alarm system, goes on high alert. Cortisol floods the system. Muscles brace. Breathing becomes shallow. And if the trauma is repeated or prolonged, this becomes the new baseline. Your body doesn't return to safety. It adapts to danger. One of the most heartbreaking things I see in survivors is how deeply they've internalized their symptoms. They think they're weak for being anxious. They feel ashamed of their hypervigilance. They blame themselves for their inability to relax or trust others. But what they need to hear, what you need to hear if this is your story, is that your body is not betraying you. It's protecting you. It adapted to danger because it had to. And those adaptations, while once helpful, are now getting in the way of your ability to live a full, connected life. But let me be clear. You are not broken. You are injured. And just as physical wounds need care, time and the conditions to heal, does trauma. That healing does not start in the thinking brain. It starts in the body. That's why body-based approaches, yoga, breathwork, EMDR, sensorimotor psychotherapy, somatic experiencing, are not alternative. They're essential. They're based on the understanding that safety, movement, and presence must come before insight. In my work, I've witnessed how powerful these methods can be. I've seen people who couldn't tolerate being touched finally lie down in a yoga class and feel safe in their own body. I've seen combat veterans reclaim their ability to feel calm. I've seen survivors of childhood abuse take a full, deep breath for the first time in decades. And that is where healing begins. When the body learns that it is no longer in danger, that it doesn't have to brace anymore, that it can return to a state of calm and curiosity, you don't have to relive every detail of your trauma to be able to heal. You can heal. You can heal. You can heal. You can heal. You can heal. You can heal. You can heal. If you have the strength and the detail of your trauma to heal.",

    "output": "And the more you experience safe, attuned connection, the more your nervous system will believe, I am safe now. I can rest. I can heal. The body keeps score, and it's always honest. You may forget what happened. You may block it, rationalize it, or silence it. But you are not alone. You may silence it, but your body doesn't forget. Your body is the most honest witness to your life. It carries everything. The fear, the shutdown, the flinching, the bracing, the breath you didn't take. The tension in your shoulders when someone raises their voice. The way you dissociate when you feel cornered. The ache in your chest you can't explain. These are not random. They are memories. They are the language of the body speaking what the mind cannot yet say. In trauma work, I often say, the body keeps the score. And it does with remarkable precision. Not to punish you. Not to sabotage you. But because the body is always trying to protect you. Always adapting. Always preparing for the worst, based on what it has survived in the past. It is trying to keep you alive, even if that means never letting you fully relax again. Here's the truth most people miss. Trauma isn't just something that happened to you in the past. It's something that continues to live inside you. In the present. In the body. In the way you breathe. The way you react. The way you hold yourself. That's why healing trauma is not just about talking. It's about listening. Listening to your body. Because the body holds everything the conscious mind tries to avoid. You may not remember what happened when you were six, but your body does. You may not remember why your stomach tightens in crowds, but your body does. You may not know why you panic when someone raises their voice, but your nervous system remembers. And it responds instantly, often without your permission, long before your rational brain has time to catch up. The problem is, most people try to outthink their trauma. They try to heal from the neck up. But trauma is not stored in the thinking brain. It's stored in the survival brain and the body. That's why insight alone is not enough. That's why talking alone is not enough.",

He is trying to regulate her emotions to control himself as opposed to understanding that he has to learn how to manage his own emotions. In other words, he accuses her of being his trigger.

He very often uses lower levels of physical violence. He uses violence, that's really what defines him as a batterer, but he's using lower levels of physical violence because he's got many other tactics and weapons at his disposal from his financial power and from his social connections.

And one of the things I was interested in when I was reading your book, and I was going to ask you to do this, which is to define abuse and to define batterer. And let me just put one thing in here that I was struck by that I read. Physical intimidation can take subtle forms that can carry an implication of threat. And if there is an implication of physical threat, that person who's doing the physical threatening becomes essentially a batterer. Is that correct. That's my definition. And I think that view is fairly widespread in the field. I can't say that's how everybody looks at it, but I would say that view is fairly widespread. my definition of a batterer and I just deal with men who abuse women. We can talk some about same-sex battering, but to be in my area of expertise, I have to talk primarily about men who abuse women. To me, he has become a batterer at the moment in which he is deliberately taking steps to put her in physical fear. He doesn't have to ever touch her. If he raises a fist, , he's trying to put her in physical fear. If he says, , I'm digging a grave for you in the backyard, that's putting her in physical fear.

That's not verbal. It is also verbally abusive, but I wouldn't put it in the verbal abuse category because I'm deliberately using it to put you in physical fear. if something blocking a door, refusing to leave Physical abuse. Pining, which is a very common thing that abusers use. What do they call it. Restraining, which I don't that word because it's pinning. You're talking about pinning the person. Those are violent acts. And we live in a In the United States, we live in an extremely violent society, people don't even think of something as violence until it becomes violent. And I'm not talking about what people call verbal violence. I don't even that term, honestly. That would be a whole other discussion. I'm talking about clear, physical, usingharming the person through their physical body. Pining them is an assault and battery. It's very oppressive. Locking someone in a room, blocking a doorway, that'sthose are which is effectively imprisoning. Yes. These things get called a lot of things that they're not.

    "output": "there's a couple pieces in here. One is that, in dealing with a domestic abuser, we're dealing with someone who has this really odd split between how he is in relationships with women and how he is in other contexts. And most people are quite surprised to hear, for example, that most domestic abusers are not personality disorder. They can look really personality disordered because they do stuff that's much a personality disorder and how they are in relationships, but you'll notice it's not playing out on any other front. Generally, it's not playing out on any other front in their lives. And they can even be answerable for their actions in other contexts. And just to insert, they may say in a fight, no one else does this happen with but you. Very popular comment. It never happens with anyone else. Why only you. This is one of the ways, from the abuser's perspective, this is one of the ways we know that you're the problem, is you're the only person I get this way with. Exactly. And that proves that you must be the problem. Yes. Rather than that proves that I see a domestic partner as my servant. Which is the real issue. And it might be an emotional servant. I don't mean necessarily someone who has to pick up your socks and cook your dinner, although a lot of domestic abusers demand service in those senses also. But the modern domestic abuser often is much more focused on emotional service, that she has to cater to him, build up his ego, want to have sex whenever he wants to have sex, not have any needs of her own, etc. that's why it's such an oddly specific problem that comes out only in intimate partner relationships or women that he wishes to have. But also with the emotional aspect, isn't it also just that his emotional life, the responsibility for his emotional wellness is hers. Isn't it more that even on a general level. from the abuser mentality is that the woman's responsibility, she's really on this earth to make him happy. And when they're first dating, he's , ooh, we're going to make beautiful music together and I'm going to do this stuff for you. And you're going to do this stuff for me.",

I'll give a somewhat strong example, whereas most of the cases are going to be much subtler than this. But I had a client who was insisting that the reason he started slapping, the reason he started hitting his partner in the car, was because, they were driving through a dangerous neighborhood at night, and she started trying to get out of the car, and he didn't want her to get out in a dangerous neighborhood. And I think he believed it. I think he had actually convinced himself that he was hitting her to protect her safety. And I was kind of making fun of him in the group. I was saying, oh , you're beating your wife to keep her safe. that's real logical, buddy. And then I said to him, no, you weren't. You were doing that because if she got away from you, then you didn't get to win the argument. If she could get out of the car, then she's escaped you, and you no longer get to rule. You feel she wins if she gets away from you. And that was the real issue. You weren't beating her to keep her safe. How can you tell yourself that. That's absurd. And in that case, I've got a whole group, even the other abusers, prepared to say, , obviously he's not hitting her to protect her. my job as the abuse counselor is to bring the true motivation to consciousness. I'm forcing him that evening to look at the fact that, , I was doing that because I didn't want her to win, which was obviously why. And because he defines that as winning, getting successfully.

I think it's nice to add one that you don't often hear, which is, what do you need to leave a relationship to. You need to leave a relationship that's not abusive. What do you need. That's a good question. You need to believe that you deserve better. You're usually going to need money because living separately is usually going to cost more almost always going to cost more than living together. You're going to need to have some sense of your own attractiveness because no one wants to end a relationship believing that means they're going to be single forevermore, , I'm leaving this relationship in order to never be with somebody again.

I always say the main obstacle to leaving an abuser is the abuse. And people commonly in the public look at this backwards. They think it would be easier to leave a relationship because of abuse than to leave a relationship for the other reasons why we leave relationships. But that's 180 degrees wrong. It's much harder to leave because of abuse than because of the other reasons why we leave relationships because the abuse takes away the key elements that I talked about earlier. that's the main obstacle you guys probably just went over that you need to leave a relationship.",

But as soon as a man is oppressing women, it starts to look this sort of private issue, and the jump away is to assume that it's something about his emotional world. then there have been various kinds of studies that have been done that don't find really very large psychological differences between abusive and non-abusive men. For example, there's a summary.

To decline and their social life will tend to decline, except for their friendships with other addicts and their physical health was trying to start to decline. None of those things happen for the domestic batter. His physical health, her physical health is going to be deteriorating over a couple over 20 years, but his physical health isn't going to deteriorate over 20 years.

I mean, I don't think it's a great way to live, but he's not doing he's not really doing himself much harm at all. He's doing huge damage to other people. The reason why I'm concerned about the way that the term narcissism has come to replace domestic abuser or batterer or domestic abuse perpetrator is that it's completely depoliticizing the problem. And the responsibility comes off the society for the way that it's raising. Boys and men. I mean, when you're talking about personality disorder, you again tend to start to think about family of origin type wounds. And that means who's most likely going to be blamed for this guy. His mother. , whoa, we're back around to finding a way to make women to blame again. And there's also the simple fact that research shows, but that we also always saw in abuser programs that something seven out of eight domestic abusers are not personality disorder.

Because if narcissism avoids contact with reality, because reality is too painful and you see too much who you truly are, then by the same token, someone who's defining their own reality, you could see how that might, one might wonder, is that a sort of an extreme narcissism where if you burst that bubble, they might go in for the attack because it's too painful to tolerate the reality you are presenting them with. But I just, this defining. Defining reality, I thought that was an interesting. one of the powerful tactics that an abuser uses is what in the field we refer to as defining reality. And it means that he really controls her sense of what is real. And some of the ways that he does this are, first of all, by just speaking with a remarkable level of certainty, where he is just sure. he can say things that are completely not true, but he says them in such an authoritative voice that it makes it very hard for her to question. She starts to think, , maybe. , he must be telling the truth because he just sounds. he'll say, for example, the police, this is how they handle certain situations when it might not be true at all. But he talks about it with such certainty and authority that it sounds very persuasive. And then if she tries to suggest that maybe that's not it, what she's going to get slammed with ridicule, a very intense level of ridicule. And I think people often underestimate the power of ridicule. They underestimate the power of various forms of psychological, psychological assault. And one of the mistakes, for example, that gets made a lot in domestic abuse is people saying, , but this guy only uses psychological abuse as if somehow these were unranked. psychological abuse is here, then physical abuse is here, and then sexual abuse is here for how damaging they are. You can't line them up that way. You can't line them up that way. There are abusers who use almost no physical or sexual violence who do unbelievable harm because their level of psychological abuse is high.",

And I will tell you that has saved me a ton from making a ton of mistakes or leaving stuff out or being confusing or just putting it in someone else's hands to get their perspective has helped much.

As an example, let me show you in Acts 13, verse 2. Luke says, One day as these men were worshiping the Lord and fasting. Now these men, he's talking about five specific men that he mentions in verse 1. They were among the prophets and the teachers of the church there in Antioch. there's five men that have gathered. It says, The Holy Spirit said, Appoint Barnabas and Saul. They were two of the five that were there. For the specific work to which I have called them. And then here it is. after more fasting and prayer, the men laid their hands on them and sent them on their way. Now we read the story of Paul and Barnabas. And the missionaries. But if you rewind back to when it all started, it wasn't just that Paul woke up and said, I'm called to be a missionary to the Gentiles and I'm bringing Barnabas and we're going no matter what.

Mattis has been taking ADHS medication every day for a year and is doing. After half an hour they start to work, until the evening, then the effect is restored. We also get feedback from school. The teacher then calls and says, can it be that Mattis has forgotten his tablet. Because it's just another child, unabashedly, on the axis. Statistically, every school class has a child with ADHS. The prescription of methylphenidate, the active ingredient of Ritalin or Medicnet, has doubled in the last 20 years. This evokes skepticism. We calm the children down. That's always the accusation that this medication is bad. There are many prejudices associated with it. Also real disinformation campaigns. This is under heavy pressure, although the effect is actually completely undisputed. There is no medication in psychiatry that has a higher -called effectiveness, that is, is more effective. Andreas Reif has been researching the treatment of ADHS for a long time. Impulsivity, missing priorities, distractibility, many know that. But is that ADHS. ADHS is a very large body size. We are all somehow big and from a certain point on we would somehow feel it as pathological. This is obviously not a problem with body size. But with behavioral stimuli, everyone of us is more or less inclined to put ADHS- behavior on the table. Some very little, some very much. And when it comes across a certain limit and problems result from it, then we call it ADHS. The core of ADHS is a combination of three difficulties. Less attention to one thing. Less foresight and being able to stay on track. Medicine calls for three different types of symptoms. First, the hyperactive ones, which appear restless, ticklish and slightly irritable. Second, the unnoticeable ones. They are easily distractible, have problems listening, because their thoughts are rushing. And third, the mixed type. Girls often manage to hide the symptoms better. In the third grade, Finja was that. That she somehow just had self-esteem. That she said, I know everything, but I can't show it or I can't write it down. And that was the point for us. That we said, we don't want it that. We don't want the child to develop a depression or something.",

And we see what has changed, namely the fugacity has decreased significantly, the restlessness has decreased. And the interesting thing now is that we can see the same patient here again, at just under 20 years old. And now she is far that she no longer needs medication. Restlessness still noticeable, yes, but therefore no load pressure. Down here, under the highest requirements, very, very good ability to cope. This young woman is out of the question. People with a deficit of attention can learn to manage their symptoms better. Ralph Myers uses completely different approaches for this, the -called multimodal therapy. Medicines, behavioral therapy, computer-based brain training and much more. As diverse as the people are, the things that help them can be colorful and different. The goal is always to be able to be medication and treatment-free at some point. It is completely clear to me that I cannot achieve this with all patients. If one treatment option brings a little success, but not enough, then I may have to go another way at the same time and a third. And then I got there.

Only 5000 from her Instagram community are currently waiting for an appointment for first diagnosis. Yes, I have now read today from someone who was happy to get an appointment after 17 months.

I want people to think about how the nature of a narcissist is never consistent. Part of their presentation is to be inconsistent. And the method or the reasoning for that is to keep everyone destabilized and always trying to pursue that approval piece, that sense of stability or consistency. what I to think of is if the narcissist is always inconsistent to create chaos, the child is in some way trying to figure out how to maintain something that feels predictable, consistent. It's a way of them regulating their own mood or the mood of the narcissist. again, going back to, if they've been feeling the golden child, they're celebrated, everything they do is quite meaningful for the narcissist, , that makes them feel good. But that doesn't really have the longevity the narcissist would maybe want them to have because the narcissist is still looking for a way to get their own needs met, which means if the golden child is achieving all of these things, in a way, the narcissist isn't really getting their supply. It's only as good as it's good. if the things are being achieved, there still is this potential unsettling energy within the narcissist because they need to create chaos. They need to create a sense of that power dynamic. And it does them no good in a way to just let a child settle into a role.

idealized image of themselves and through the golden child and when the golden child fails they feel almost betrayed how can you fail exactly when i've already been encouraged or i felt i had the attention and the positive reinforcement from the narcissistic parent what happened but yes absolutely i mean again i go back to what the narcissist needs which is not to feel anyone else understands any predictability and what they're looking for it really always comes back to it's never going to be enough it will never ever be enough it does set up a child as you just said to feel i've always done everything i thought what happened that i fell out of favor why did i do that what happened to me what happened to me what happened to me what happened to me what happened to me what happened to me what happened to me what happened to me why was that not good enough when it was good enough yesterday it was always something i i don't know if i should use an example or not but i just quickly i remember talking to a client once that talked about how everything was always perfect and they were always making sure everything was perfect and one day out of the blue something they did that they had always done they just found one little criticism to judge them and it really unraveled them and caused them to feel again confused and lost and critical of themselves and very guilty and very shame-based because just one small thing it wasn't even anything in my opinion meaningful but enough to let that person i think that's what you're saying to feel i thought i had it figured out and was this was this client of yours golden child usually yes at the time because those roles but at the time again it was their own ability to feel they had mastered what they thought they needed because they meant it was safe and everything was achieved and they felt connected and they felt the predictability of what they needed and they felt the predictability of what they needed to feel connection to the narcissist again it's just it's just part of the game of a narcissist you will never perhaps ever really feel that consistency in any of the roles that you think you need to be in order to maintain a connection it doesn't work for the narcissist they still need to in some way destabilize you to keep that power differential in place and cause you to feel you're losing your mind i think that's a good ad because i believe it might be sometimes kind of common misconception that oh it's a global problem and i think that's a good idea to have a golden child and then you're oh it's a golden child or a golden child is always a golden child scapegoat is always the scapegoat but in reality they're actually very fluid ever changing creating that uncertainty it's the chaos and the drama of the family and those roles move very quickly sometimes they're not quick maybe they're not as noticeable and they might be a little more gradual and then all of a sudden you realize something shifted and then other families depending on the energy of the narcissist because we know it's on a continuum those roles might switch very quickly causing even more chaos within the family system and uncertainty of who am i in this system are you saying to simplify to be the more narcissistic the person is on the others on the continuum the more likely it is that the roles shift even faster is that what you say sometimes that mood energy from the narcissist if they are very temperamental because narcissists show up a little bit differently i don't want to get too off the topic there but again i don't think it's it's good for people to think maybe a one-size-fits-all when we're talking about the word narcissist because that word is flung out in many different conversations now i think you still need to understand there's some general common pieces to it but if you have a very temperamental narcissist who is even more likely to erupt or to be to shift that mood because some are a little more sullen they're a little more victimized they're a little more of that depressed piece people might be able to manage some of that mood a little bit better but if they're very active on a more regular basis then that can cause maybe those roles to be a little more shifting fast because that energy feels more threatening that actually makes me think of this one idea that I came across that also kind of stress can intensify those role changes because narcissists they are very unable to regulate their emotions then they lash out to whoever is closest it doesn't matter if it's a golden child but if there's someone else in that moment and they can't deal with whatever they can just offload their frustration no matter if it's the golden child or scapegoat that might also and that probably creates a lot of confusion for their child because they might not have done anything they have thought that they are now it's been very good season I'm kind of doing everything then something happens and it's actually caused by the parents inability to regulate their emotions and something happens and they can't handle it and they just are very frustrated and the thing I was also going to mention based on what you said is if you think about a child who's an only child in a narcissistic family then obviously they are prone to serve many roles depending on what is going on that's an example of maybe a person understanding maybe it does get confusing if you've got multiple siblings that are have different roles within the family but one child can equally flip-flop into different roles depending on what the narcissist needs they can be valued and then devalued very quickly and I think that again one of the hallmarks of a narcissist is they are attracted to something that they want to boast about because you're an extension of them for a while it can be that they're going to really celebrate you but they cannot tolerate feeling somebody deserves that kind of treatment because it goes against their fragile ego that's why also there would be an intolerance of maybe celebrating a person too much because they aren't strong enough to manage I'm good and are you no if I'm saying you're good and you're perfect at all these things that's starting to threaten my own sense of who I am I've got to remind myself of how you are all of them you have a sense of it's not I don't know or either that's a real risk to you it's a real risk to an adult it's not I don't know how to go about it if you're an adult or if you're an adult and you are also capable of not being as good as I'm telling you are, because I have to reclaim some sense of my own inner security in myself.",

I'm going to answer these questions by looking at the ten signs or characteristics of vindictive narcissism. when I talk about narcissism in the context of this video, I'm really talking about pathological narcissism. narcissism is kind of an interesting personality construct because it has a few different levels and types. I usually think about it as being on a continuum, but having kind of a type on each end,. you have the grandiose side and the vulnerable side, and people typically will move back and forth between these two types of narcissism. Although sometimes people really. do tend to stay on one side or the other most of the time. really quickly with narcissism, we see this construct is characterized by being self-centered, having a sense of entitlement, requiring admiration, and being antagonistic. being disagreeable. The grandiose type is characterized by being socially dominant, extrovert, having low neuroticism, being arrogant and being resistant to criticism. This is also called overt narcissism. Vulnerable narcissism. Vulnerable narcissism. Vulnerable narcissism. Vulnerable narcissism. Vulnerable narcissism. Vulnerable narcissism. Vulnerable narcissism. Vulnerable narcissism is characterized by shame, low extroversion, high neuroticism, hypersensitivity to criticism, and resentfulness. This is also called covert narcissism. if we look at these two types and we think about that continuum I was talking about, vindictive narcissism is really somewhere in between grandiose and vulnerable. It's not 100 grandiose, and it's not 100 vulnerable. Although sometimes it appears to be more vulnerable than grandiose. It's also not the same. thing as Machiavellianism, and I'll talk more about that in a moment. Now taking a look at the 10 signs or characteristics of vindictive narcissism. Number one, vindictive narcissism involves dominance, and this is really one of the key differences between vindictive narcissism and vulnerable narcissism, but not the only difference. In social and work settings, we see that the vindictive narcissist wants things to be their way.",

    "output": "They want to be in control, and they believe it's good that they would be in control, things are better because they're in charge. Subordinates are expected to follow orders without question. To the vindictive narcissist, other people are weak and incapable, therefore again justifying the need to dominate. the need to dominate really falls more on the grandiose side, but the mechanism for being vindictive, for seeking revenge, moves back to the vulnerable side, and I'll talk about that more with some of these other signs. now moving to number two, we see the vindictive narcissist. The vindictive narcissist loves to have power. They have fantasies of success and power. This is one of the symptom criteria for narcissistic personality disorder. We see that really, though, they should not have power in terms of what's good for society. Vindictive narcissists are more dangerous when they are given legitimate authority in social groups or in work settings. They tend to pick on people that they have power over, subordinates, or people that are equal, but they're careful about seeking revenge, against superiors. there's a lack of insight with narcissism, but there's still an awareness of some of the consequences of being vindictive. it's kind of an interesting dichotomy. When you have a lack of insight, somebody really doesn't see how they're acting or understand their behavior, but on the other hand, they do seem to appreciate that some of the behavior could get them in trouble. it's not all about a lack of awareness. Number three, they're not very good at manipulation when competing with others. they're not very good at manipulating others. they're not very good when competing with others. they're not very good at manipulating others. they're not very good compared to other narcissists. However, they will still attempt to manipulate, especially gaslighting, trying to convince you that you were the problem. they're not actually that good at it. And people can usually spot their attempts at manipulation away. if we look at something Machiavellianism, which may seem similar to vindictive narcissism at first glance, we actually see they're fairly different. Someone who's Machiavellianistic is actually pretty good at controlling their own emotions. But with vindictive narcissism, we see high neuroticism, just we do with vulnerable narcissism. we hear this term, feelings of revenge, more often than we hear the term, thoughts of revenge.",

    "input": "I'm trying to understand narcissist better. What would you want someone to know about this?",
    "output": "This is much different than what we see with Machiavellianism. They are willing to destroy themselves in order to destroy others. People are actually scared a lot of times of vindictive narcissists, which makes it possible for them to recruit narcissistic agents, sometimes referred to as flying monkeys, a reference we see from The Wizard of Oz. But for some people, it's just easier to join the narcissist than to be a victim of a narcissist. again, all of these are kind of characteristics of this revenge that is not thought out and not very sophisticated. Number six, the moment the perceived insult occurs may not be when the plot for revenge is formed. A process called rumination actually seems to be more involved. the development of revenge is actually gradual. The development of revenge is gradual. The process is gradual. The process is gradual. The process is gradual. The process is gradual. The process is gradual. The process is gradual. The process is gradual. The process is gradual. And each time that memory is re-experienced, it can be processed in a different way. And one of those ways could be as an intolerable insult, and that's all it takes. Just one interpretation that demands retribution. Number seven, a tremendous amount of time and energy is committed to the revenge. the vindictive narcissist really focuses a lot of energy and thought and planning into this revenge plot, even though, again, the plot is very unsophisticated. This is not unlike what we see with substance use disorder. If we look at the definition of that disorder, we see that somebody spends a lot of time thinking about substances, various ways that they're going to get it, what it's going to be when they get it, planning all aspects of obtaining it and using it. There's a true sense of satisfaction and relief when the vindictive narcissist can get revenge. But of course, this is only temporary. In the end, the pain and distress of getting revenge for the vindictive narcissist does actually outweigh any benefits. But again, without any learning taking place, they just continue the same behavior over and over. It's not they exact this poorly constructed plan for revenge and then see that in the end it didn't work out for them and say, , I'm going to do something different.",

    "input": "What should someone know about narcissist and how it affects their relationships and healing?",
    "output": "That's not the mechanism we see with this type of narcissism. And really, we don't see a lot of learning with narcissism in general, which is one of the reasons it's quite problematic. It's problematic for the narcissist and for other people that are exposed to narcissistic behavior. Number eight, we see that the vindictiveness associated with this type of narcissism is not always about holding a grudge because really what we see here is emotional dysregulation, high neuroticism. Somebody can seek revenge, get revenge, and then move on and then move on to somebody else or move on and do something altogether different. If they don't get the revenge they wanted or they don't feel they got the revenge they wanted. It takes a long time for them to move on. And sometimes we do see situations where people really never move on. The narcissist is always in a mode where they're chasing after somebody and trying to get revenge. In a way, this is worse for other people because now they're kind of victims of the narcissist continually. But another way is kind of better because potential victims can see that the behavior is not going to stop and it pushes them to take action, to avoid the narcissist or to confront the narcissist in a productive way. these sporadic revenge behavior in some ways can actually be more difficult, can actually cause a lot of suffering, more than one would think when comparing it to the more continual revenge behavior. Number nine, the vindictive narcissist believes that they are the victim in the situation where they perceived an insult. They believe that revenge is something that they deserve. It's warranted and that anyone would expect to or want to get revenge if they are in the same situation. they're setting things , getting even. Somebody took something from them and therefore they're going to take something from that person. At some level, they may truly believe they're just standing up for their own. But of course, their version of their own is really expanded because they have that sense of entitlement. that standard is set really high. They believe they have a tremendous number of and those are fairly strong, which in a sense gives them more motivation, enthusiasm, and energy because they feel justified. they're setting things. They have a just and righteous sense of purpose.",

    "output": "Number 10, the attempts at revenge made by the vindictive narcissist can be considered insulting by another vindictive narcissist. I've seen this happen quite a few times. Some of the worst feuds are between two people who are both vindictive narcissist. Nobody knows when to stop. Nobody will cut their losses and walk away. Simply attaining a safe and fair resolution is not enough. there's this theory, of course, that sometimes revenge is provisional. But that's not the case. It's not the case. It's not the case. It's not the case. It's not the case. It's not the case. It's not the case. It's not the case. It really is provisional. It's kind of a social construct, constructive and necessary for regulating social interactions. But that's not what we're really talking about here. We're talking about an irrational commitment to revenge on both sides,. Because again, both sides have somebody who has vindictive narcissism. every action must lead to another act of vengeance. And in these situations where you have two vindictive narcissists, we see that these are the most likely to escalate into some sort of physical altercation. these are the 10 signs or characteristics of a vindictive narcissist. Number 11 is that it's not a crime. It's not a crime. of vindictive narcissism. We see this type of narcissist can be very successful in the short run, meaning successful meaning their goals, but they're typically discovered in the long run. After they've exhibited the same behaviors repeatedly, people can really see it a lot easier. Now, strategies to deal with them are actually pretty hard to come by in terms of effective strategies. Somebody can walk on eggshells, be apologetic, but this usually just leads to suffering. The vindictive narcissist is going to continue their act of revenge. This type of narcissism leads to a great amount of suffering for many people. It's not just the narcissist. It's all these other people around them. Another tactic is avoidance. This could work out fairly , but it's not always an option for everybody. We see that somebody can stand up to the vindictive narcissist, just a bully, again, a schoolyard bully. They are shocked by resistance. But not everybody has the ability or inclination to stand up for themselves, and this method can still end up churning out quite badly, although sometimes it can turn out.",

    "output": "Hi everyone, it's Dr. Ramani. Welcome back to this YouTube channel that takes on narcissism. It's my hope that what you hear on this channel will help you cope with these relationships and better be able to navigate the difficult territory of these difficult relationships. we've been doing a series that talks about the family roles people have, golden child, scapegoat, and all of that, and talks about what happens to people in these roles. today we're going to talk about what happens to the golden child. Now this series is, , we've talked about what each of these roles is and I think you have a pretty good handle on it and many of you are clear on what role or roles you occupied in your family. But a lot of people wonder, what does this set me up for. What could happen for me. Or alternately, I'm raising kids, I have a narcissistic co-parent, and I can see my child taking on these roles. What are some of the pathways that are more likely. Now as we work through what happens to people who hold the various family roles, the long-term story for this role of the golden child is actually more complicated than you might think. First, let's talk about the golden child just as a review to ensure that we're all on the same page. The golden child is really what it sounds. The favored child, the one who actually is the favored child of the narcissistic parent who gets things that typically the other children, their siblings in the family system couldn't even imagine getting. Validation, praise, time, attention and resources. The golden child is the golden child, typically for reasons that reflect the narcissistic parent's role in the family. what does this set me up for. What is it that you can do to help the child in a way that is more comfortable. The golden child is the one who is the most important person in the family. The only thing needs. Sometimes the golden child is more attractive to or resembles the narcissistic parent. It may be that they're outstanding in school, particularly obedient or -behaved, or it's the gender that the parent prefers. For example, a narcissistic father wanting a male child.",

    "output": "Not surprisingly, the golden children, more than any other type, are at risk for becoming world-class entitled jerks, or , you guessed it, quite narcissistic themselves. The overindulgence, they're being spoiled, always getting their way, and being coddled and over attended to by the narcissistic parent, for a lifetime, can result in a very entitled, arrogant, kind of mean to their siblings, grandiose and completely dysregulated adult. Either they expect the other people in the world to keep treating them their narcissistic parent treats them, or they internalize that message that they are just special, that they don't have to have any tolerance, for a moment, where they're anything but special. At that point, then it's all the golden rules of narcissism in play. It doesn't really change, you can never win, et cetera. the drill. When the golden child turns into an adult narcissist, they are typically gonna be more often the grandiose narcissist than anything else, and then the rest of the story if they're narcissistic. But there's another rather difficult side for the golden child, which is the narcissistic side. They're the path that the golden child, or golden children, may find themselves on. And that could sometimes be tremendous guilt. If a golden child temperamentally comes into the world as a nice child, a child that has empathy, and a decent heart, they will sense the differential treatment they're receiving, and they may actually feel very guilty about it, even at a very young age. They may keep trying to draw their other siblings in to get the special things that they get, or guide the narcissistic parent who favors them to also see the virtues in their other parent or in their siblings. It's as though that golden child is placed in the uncomfortable role of being some sort of a special envoy who has special access to the narcissistic parent, and they think maybe this parent who just is all about me will listen to me. It's a really unfair position to put any child in. And it gets really painful at that point, because the narcissistic parent often ain't gonna buy it. They'll say things , come on now, do we really wanna bring your brother along on this errand. He's gonna slow us down, and he's such a pain in the ass.",

But it becomes really crucial that the golden child not enable the narcissistic parent or gaslight their siblings or even their other parent, all of whom had very different childhoods and lives than the golden child did. It doesn't matter what your role is, from scapegoat to golden child to invisible child. Having a high conflict antagonistic entitled narcissistic parent takes a tremendous toll on a person. Narcissistic parents manipulate no matter what type the child is and even for the golden children who may be on the receiving side of a better situation. Growing up in the midst of gaslighting, rage, manipulation and invalidation, even if it's not happening directly to you, always takes a toll. Golden children, it's not an easy role. Either they really go over to the dark side and really become, , frankly narcissistic or they carry a legacy which people might have seen, especially people close to that family system, might have seen as being privileged and easy. But it's actually a heavy burden to bear. And oftentimes it's not what the child asked for. For the golden child to cut the narcissistic parent off or even ask them to do things differently when they're in childhood, it's a lot to ask of a child because that golden child will face the same wrath as anybody else who tells that narcissistic person no. The path to recovery, as it were, for the golden child is to be able to be a little more open-minded and open-minded. And that's what the golden child does.

Now, I recently had the pleasure of reading a 2015 academic article written by Krizan and Johar from Iowa State University, and the article was on narcissistic rage. It was a really great paper that broke down narcissistic rage and the different ways it shows based on whether a person is more of a grandiose narcissist or a vulnerable narcissist. But the authors did a nice job of also shedding light on something that is really worth talking about on this channel called the shame-rage spiral. Their manuscript, and they were talking about other people's research too, it brings up a quote from a famous theorist who studied narcissism named Heinz Kohut, and he wrote, The need for revenge, for righting a wrong, for undoing a hurt by whatever means. And a deeply anchored unrelenting compulsion in the pursuit of all these aims are the characteristic features of narcissistic rage in all its forms. it's a fancy way of saying it, but Kohut and many other authors point out basically that if you question a narcissist's reality, they will punch back, which is really interesting because one of their primary maneuvers is to question your reality and gaslight you. Now, remember, the narcissist has to come out of the trap and be a real narcissist, and that's what I'm talking about.

They want to get ahead of being discarded themselves now that their shame is public. Now, other researchers such as Roark have pointed out that shame doesn't just elicit rage. It can also elicit a passive-aggressive response, especially in covert narcissists. And this can then devolve into the narcissist ruminating on you. And this can then devolve into the narcissist ruminating on you. The narcissist ruminating about their plan to finally punish, or dominate, or control the person who called them out or triggered their shame. , whether it's traditional old-fashioned in-your-face rage, or the passive-aggressive, sullen, resentful, brooding, obsessive rage, the reaction is rage. then, over time, as it does turn more and more into rage, the narcissistic person then chronically starts to rage at people who, is it ever going to be an offensive person. Is that something they're going to do. at people who evoke their feelings of shame. Now rage isn't good and people don't judge rageful people. It's not a good look. now the narcissist gets stuck in a cycle of feeling shame, lashing out with rage, feeling more shame as a result, lashing out with more rage and you can see how that escalates. Most of the narcissist's rage has a shame based origin and in this way the entire world can feel one big shame inducing threat for narcissists. Thus they have their grandiosity, their defensiveness, their entitlement. All of these are their suits of armor that protect those narcissists from shame, but they're not always going to work. the short story is the narcissist's fear of being found out means that they are at constant risk of shame. Inevitably the shame gets triggered. Boom. you can see how this is going to affect your life. As I mentioned, a narcissist is not required to be ashamed of their actions. Inevitably the shame gets triggered. Boom. and then they rage. And this is why many people get stuck in the eggshell walking cycle around narcissists. Nobody wants to trigger them, but most people aren't clear that the thing that you're actually trying to avoid triggering is the shame, because that's what leads to the rage.",

I must say that the work of shame is the hardest work of all with a narcissistic individual. To let them know that they are just as solid a person with or without the promotion, or the better car, or even if they told a lie. My work then becomes to teach them the appropriate ways of addressing those moments without having to tell the truth. And it's a tough battle because the shame sequence gets activated quickly when a narcissist perceives that they're going to get found out. Maybe some of you are, but in general with your loved ones you aren't their therapist to the narcissist in your life. it's not your role to do this. And listen carefully. And even if you did, it wouldn't work. And the narcissist may rage at you even more. And treat you with even more terror. contempt for trying to soothe them. Again, the shame gets activated. This shame-rage cycle is why sometimes narcissists will come around with apologies after going on a rage bender. They want to erase it in a way. And if you don't accept their apology, voila, the cycle starts again because their vulnerability was made public. The shame-rage cycle is why often these relationships are almost impossible to fix. The kind of therapy the narcissist requires is hard work, requires long-term commitment, a very skilled therapist, and regular therapy for a very long time. These things are not available to most people, and most narcissists are very contemptuous of therapy anyhow. When the therapist really starts going in deep, that's often when they drop out. perhaps if you understand this cycle, though, it's my hope that you won't personalize the shame-rage cycle. There isn't much you can do. There's actually, to me, something quite tragic about this dynamic. That fear, that paralyzing fear of what would happen if someone really saw your faults being such a destabilizing space. And compassion in these spaces can get very tricky.

This all brings up a lot of This all brings up a lot of the problems that we've been talking about, and I think that's why I'm excited to talk about this. This all brings up larger societal issues of why don't we work with families, and especially with parents, and also with health care providers and educators to help people learn to just be with themselves. Faults and all. Listen carefully again. Shame has no place in a child's life. And for both narcissists who likely were shamed for not being good enough as kids, and for their victims who were also shamed for not being good enough as kids. We can see how this cycle puts into place this whole system almost of oppression and victimization of these narcissists who rage and of people who endure the rage. And on both sides it's happening because of early messages of not being good enough and of shame. Listen, I can't change that tide by myself. It's a societal shift that frankly I have to believe will take many generations to happen, if it ever can. But in your life now, now, if you're stuck in a rage cycle with a narcissist, at a minimum, I hope this sheds some light on it, lifts some of the blame off of you, and encourages you to seek out the help you need to process this, and lifts the burden of responsibility to be the one who fixes this problem off of your shoulders. The narcissists themselves can and must seek out help to end this cycle. You can't do it for them. I do hope this illuminates some of this. And also to give you another example, think of the shame cycle, the shame rage cycle. where it often manifests. Social media posts. Ever see that happen. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. Insult, insult, insult, back and forth. They get into rages, they get into fights, they get into all kinds of shouting matches on social media. That's a great example of the shame rage cycle. Someone says something. Maybe they don't know what they're saying. Maybe they don't the narcissist post.",

We can make this a short video and just say disengage and be done with it. But the challenge is that it's not that easy. And sometimes the flying monkeys in your life, in your life they're not as toxic as the original narcissist. let's address ways for managing the flying monkeys that are inevitably a part of your life if you have a narcissist in your life. Let's start by breaking down what flying monkeys are. They are typically enablers. But they can also be people who are ignorant about narcissistic patterns and do not see it and they're clay in the narcissistic person's hands who can manipulate them with ease. Flying monkeys are typically people who were one time or may still be connected to both you and the narcissist. These could be family members, friends, co-workers, neighbors. The narcissistic person will mobilize the flying monkeys typically at times when things aren't going between you and the narcissist. Maybe it's a close relationship that's unraveling, a contentious family relationship, a difficult workplace situation, or a friendship that's falling apart. Because the narcissistic person is always looking for a way to create advantage for themselves and they want to maintain a narrative that deflects any blame and responsibility from them and place it on someone else and they have to end up looking wonderful in everybody else's eyes,. Mobilizing the flying monkeys is a way for them to achieve all three of those things and put the blame on you.",

    "output": "Now that means that there are people around you, around all of us, that can be mobilized into that role of flying monkey. One of the most painful parts of flying monkeys is that these are people, they're often people, who you may have considered to be friends or trusted family or just good people in your life. Unfortunately, because narcissistic people are skilled at wearing a mask, they may have tricked these people and there are many people out there who don't want to believe that there can be the darkness of narcissism in our midst. And any of us who have been through narcissistic abuse and really get it, I think we're regularly shocked at how few people out in the world at large do get it. Now, flying monkeys are people who are often vulnerable and recruitable and the manipulations of the narcissist are no match for their rosy-eyed or naive vision of the world. Flying monkeys, I said, can be enablers and often want to maintain a sort of pretty and simple view of the world. And who can blame them. I wish the world was simpler than the view of it that I've got these days. But that makes the flying monkeys vulnerable to a twisted narrative and also one where the narcissistic person beautifully is able to paint themselves as a victim. Now, just the original flying monkeys in The Wizard of Oz, they're a flock. They're almost a flock of birds. They mob and come at you as a group, which leaves you feeling even more gaslighted because it seems an entire group of people are on the same page in a way that is completely at odds with your reality and siding with the narcissist. This can be devastating if it is a family and you actually believe that some of these family members had your back or you've had their back and you've been there for them in the past. Or it could be a long-standing group of friends whom you have known for years. In fact, you might have been friends with them even before the narcissist became friends with them. Or colleagues that you have supported for years. It's a betrayal. And because it's a betrayal at such a large scale, it is overwhelming and unsettling.",

It's as though they. project their devaluation of themselves onto you. Now, devaluation can last for months, years, and even decades. It becomes, before it, sort of a new normal. Your life tends to be punctuated by insults and by invalidation. The discard is just what it sounds. Discarding is honestly throwing out the trash. It's they're done with you. Now, sometimes discarding never really truly happens. You may just kind of get stuck in the purgatory of devaluation forever. But discarding happens when they cast you aside. This is almost discarding, it can be really cold, and you can actually have a narcissistic relationship that keeps happening even when you've been discarded. For example, your narcissist may have an affair with you.",

    "output": "The narcissist isn't going to turn around and say, , I'm not capable of making healthy attachments. And I'm deeply insecure. And I have contempt for intimacy. I am actually, , I'm rejecting you and I'm treating you badly to see and test my hypothesis that you will observe my insecurity and that you will leave me and my fantasies. That's the case. And then let's see if that comes true. Now, they are not going to say that to you, even though that's the dynamic that's likely unfolding. asking them for an explanation is likely to bring. More harm than good because they themselves aren't in touch with what's happening. Now, the devaluing and discarding sack cycles happen in families as. In general, if you aren't just blindly going along with a narcissist agenda, then they often think that you are against them. And in a family, this can happen when you just don't go along with the program, with what the narcissistic pair. And. Or sibling or aunt or grandparent want. Your family members, the family members will find out that if you or they learn that if you appease the narcissistic family member, then you will be able to keep them calm and stay in their good graces. And this can be particularly profound if the narcissist has some kind of power. , for example, the money that they may use to control. Family members. if you do lay down some real boundaries, that's when often in a family, the devaluation and discarding cycle can begin. Now, for scapegoats in a family system, the discard and devaluation cycle is an eternal part of the scapegoats role in the family system. They're constantly being devalued, constantly being devalued. And if the scapegoat tries to set a boundary, boom. They'll be discarded. Now, devaluing and discarding can also absolutely take place in workplace settings. And in those cases, it's in which narcissistic bosses and narcissistic managers and leaders devalue the people that they think aren't their team players. Basically, these are the people who are not the yes men or the yes women. And then ultimately, they may make life miserable for the people who don't just sign on with whatever twisted agenda they have. That those people actually end up leaving or may get fired. Now, the devaluation and discarding cycle is, sadly enough, often followed by hoovering.",

And these terms come up in blogs and in videos and many times people aren't fully sure what they mean. My hope is to create some clarity there. But there also may be terms here that may just be brand new to you and may be a place for you to understand some of the patterns in your narcissistic relationship.

And it runs the risk of blaming the person who finds himself or herself in the narcissistic relationship. And I'm going to talk about that now. let's get started.

    "output": "He also speaks to some of the risks we observe for a person as a codependent pattern and he'll highlight a history of physical or sexual abuse that often appears in a codependent person's life and that a person who's experiencing codependency may also be experiencing stress related physical illnesses. These could be things chronic headaches or autoimmune flare-ups. And finally in his definition the codependent person does not seek help. The overall picture here is of someone who is stuck in a very victimized situation and is not only not trying to get out but is basically clipping their own wings and staying in it. The presumption, at least my read on it, is that the codependent person is aware of the risks that they're experiencing and that they're not trying to get out of it. he's not trying to get out of it. He's not trying to get out of it. He's not trying to get out of it. He's not trying to get out of it. He's not trying to get out of it. in this case, the codependent person is aware that their partner is a substance user or has very toxic, difficult kinds of patterns and behaviors. But they will minimize those issues. Ultimately, however, the codependent personality in some ways gets their self-esteem by the sense that they can somehow control the behavior of someone else in their life. in the case of substance abuse or alcohol, it's when their partner, for example, or someone else in the family isn't drinking. their self-esteem gets completely linked to someone else's behavior. And that, in fact, is something that they can't control. it's a very risky place to get your self-esteem from. Now there are some members who believe that narcissistic relationships largely remain in place because the partners are codependent enablers. who participate in the toxic spiral because the narcissist feeds their vulnerabilities while the codependent partner keeps providing narcissistic supply. Now it's a little bit risky to view it through this lens because personally I think it misses some key issues. Now before Dr. Cermak put his definition out there, codependency was a term that originated in the clinical literature that focused on addiction. And a lot of its earlier origins come out of the language of 12-step programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous.",

    "output": "And some people actually find the origins of their codependent cycles didn't start in childhood. They actually show up in their adult relationships, especially if their adult relationship is with a substance abuser or a person with a high conflict personality style such as narcissism. And this codependent style may cut across all of a person's relationships. It could be a cycle. You replicate in not only romantic relationships but friendships, work relationships, you name it. And given that there are often traumatic origins and codependent cycles, and much of this cycle and these patterns mirror the trauma bonding cycle, which is also covered in this series, to push back on a codependent pattern, trauma-focused therapies become essential. But I am going to come back to this. I'm going to come back to this. I'm going to come back to my original premise. I do believe, I do believe that a certain percentage of narcissistic relationship dynamics do reflect codependency, but not all of them. I believe that there is a substantial subset for whom education about these cycles, namely that narcissistic individuals are not going to change, and that they are indeed classical cycles that kind of play out the same way for most people, that you don't need to personalize these cycles. When people know that, it tends to set many people free. Only if this term fits you or someone. the term codependency often aligns with the trauma bonding cycle and is often a part of, a big part of the discourse about narcissistic relationships. Now. I think it is much more complex and is not always a given that codependency is exactly what's happening. before you, if you are in a narcissistic relationship, before you just wrap yourself in the label of codependency, I want you to really reflect on your patterns. Many people who stay in narcissistic relationships are not in denial. They know exactly what they are dealing with. But a variety of reasons. I don't know, finances, court systems that don't get it, custody systems that don't get it, culture, religion, practical factors, they make an informed deal with the devil. And they try to escape as soon as any of the strictures get released. For example, the day all of their children are over the age of 18 or they're able to get secure employment, they get out.",

If you're managing false hopes and narratives, and especially if all of this is occurring against the backdrop of your own early life trauma, that's part of your story, please, please consider therapy as a place to do that deep dive and explore these patterns. Narcissism. Narcissists persist because the world enables them. It often starts with parents. And then narcissistic patterns can also be enabled by school systems, by friends, by workplaces, by social media, by extended families, and by the world in general. Our beloved narcissists get praised for their cool efficiency, their charm, their cool behavior, their cool behavior. They're not just narcissists. They're narcissists for their confidence and their success. And sadly, there's often little regard for what kind of person they are. And in that way, it's a little cynical, but in that way, perhaps all of us are a little codependent with the narcissistic people and systems around us. Perhaps all of us do derive some level of self-esteem on the hope and the very, very hazy promise. That maybe. That we're going to be the one to master this other person. Never ever link your self-esteem to another human being. You are you. A free standing unit.

What does the narcissist do when they lose their scapegoat. for any of you who are currently or have been a scapegoat with a narcissist this is a question that comes up a lot because there's a lot of fantasy around it what happens when they no longer have me. Let's break it down and I would also love to hear from you. If any of you were the scapegoat and you did finally find a way to step away what happened when you stepped away. It's very very hard for the scapegoat to pull away from the narcissist. The trauma bonding is intense but let's talk about it. The scapegoat to be the scapegoat this is a term that is most often used to describe the role somebody has in a narcissistic family system. It's the person or people in a family narcissistic family system that get the worst of the narcissistic person's abuse and because of the triangulation the narcissist is often able to recruit other family or other members of the family system to perpetrate more abuse against the scapegoat who over time are able to recruit more abuse against the scapegoat who over time becomes the punching bag for everyone in the family system. The scapegoat is subjected to criticism, mockery, humiliation, rage, sometimes physical or other forms of abuse and becomes the repository of the narcissist's shame.",

Now scapegoating can happen in other narcissistic systems as , including workplaces, groups of friends, or even other kinds of organized groups, community groups, , any kind of group. It's only since there's a narcissist sort of in that system and there's someone that they're taking something out at, there's a scapegoat in it,. The narcissist in some ways gets their power from other people watching fearfully at what is happening to the scapegoat and wanting to avoid that fate for themselves. And just in any cult, other people get pulled into the narcissistic person's magnetic fold and join the scapegoating for any number of reasons. To win over the narcissist, to keep themselves safe in the system, to survive, perhaps to get their own power in the system, and because some of the people who join into the scapegoating are narcissistic themselves. To be a scapegoat is an absolutely terrible way to have to spend a childhood, it impacts attachment, it generates core wounds, it impairs a sense of safety in the world and identity development. Scapegoats may experience significant anxiety, not only in childhood, but also adulthood, self-devaluation, issues with self-esteem, holding limiting beliefs about the self, mood symptoms depression, and basically scapegoats will spend a lifetime selling themselves short and often don't fully enact their potential. In more serious cases, scapegoats may experience severe cases, scapegoated children as they become older may be at risk for even more dangerous behaviors including self-harm, substance use, disordered eating, and other forms of dangerous acting out. It is an incredibly heavy, painful legacy to carry. However though, here's the million dollar question. What happens when a narcissistic person loses their scapegoat. It's really quite interesting because in many ways the narcissistic person is a scapegoat. And in many ways, the narcissistic person is a scapegoat. And in many ways, the narcissistic person is a scapegoat. And in many ways, the narcissistic person is a scapegoat. And in many ways, the narcissistic person uses the scapegoat to regulate.

You're going no contact from your family can feel rebellion. You're going no contact from your audience at the bottom of your self- soscastle. You might be a little bit more of a, a karmic defiance and not what it really is at the core of it. Most people go no contact in an attempt to make themselves feel safe, to cut off the voices that threaten your sense of self. But your parent will be treating it as simple defiance, and it can give you pause and make you wonder, am I just being defiant and rebellious. And then again, play on that self-doubt and self-shame, you will recall how the narcissistic parent would basically go no contact whenever it worked for them. The silent treatment is a universal tactic that is used by narcissistic parents. It might be how they communicated disapproval, disappointment, you not being what they want you to be. The way that narcissistic parents deployed silent treatments when you were a child was part of the endless abandonments that constitute a childhood in a narcissistic family system.",

    "output": "Again, it's not easy and even more complex because a parent making this decision may also reflect back onto what was their contribution on their own child's behavior. Estrangement, is a train depot, with lots of lines coming in and out. There's no simple pathway to this. no, TikTok or YouTube or the internet is not what is leading people to become estranged from their toxic, harmful, invalidating families of origin. It's the family's behavior that's leading to that. Everybody wants to belong to a family system and nobody gives it up lightly. But for the first time ever, we're having deeper conversations, about what the meaning of going no contact from a harmful family system is, the grief around it, but also understanding that in some cases, some people actually find solace in it. And that instead of shaming people who make an incredibly difficult decision, perhaps we all need to pause a moment and really hear their story. And estrangement is a hot topic these days. And again, I was doing some reading on it recently. And in one piece I had read, specifically addressing the issue of, no contact. And the idea of therapists actually supporting clients in their decision to go no contact. Now the article was a little misleading, because it made it sound as though the therapists were encouraging the clients or the patients to go no contact. But what was happening is that the therapist were saying, it's to go no contact. And that it could help. Estrangement and going no contact, especially family settings, is no joke. It's the DEFCON 1 of solution. It's the tourniquet of first aid approaches. It's the end of the line. I have spoken before on this idea that nobody comes to this decision of estrangement easily. , nobody really. Almost nobody does. And unfortunately, what often comes up, is that it is perceived that when a person makes a decision to go no contact with a family member, or even an entire family, that it was some kind of easy breezy decision that they made. Oh, my family is pissing me off and not giving me my way. I'm going to show them and I'm going to cut them off and not talk to them anymore. There is sort of a spoiled child stigma about people who become estranged from their families.",

    "input": "I'm struggling with childhood. Can you help me understand what's happening?",
    "output": "Some people go no contact, because childhood trauma and abuse were denied by family members. Or because there is ongoing physical abuse in the family system. Or there is financial abuse. Or because family members may represent a risk to minor children coming into the system. Or there's unresolved substance abuse or an addiction. Or there's violence and aggression. And these all may be patterns that are denied or enabled by other family members, simply making the family of origin too dangerous. As I have also said before, the estrangement that people may find themselves in, and the no contact they may decide for when they have a narcissistic family system, is not the same as the silent treatment or passive aggression and withholding, that a narcissistic person may engage in to punish other people. Basically with the goal of forcing other people to apologize, even when the other people have done nothing wrong, to break the silence and to break the no contact. That's not what I'm talking about here. But estrangement, and, or I should say the shaming of estrangement and no contact, that's not going anywhere. And what that means, is that if you make a decision to go no contact, I know it is or was a painful and difficult decision, and there's a lot of hurt on the path to getting there. However, do not think that all people can hear about your no contact or your estrangement with an open and wise ear. You have to be discerning in how you share it. Or the shaming and the negating can be too painful, and it can set your healing back. Some of you may not give a damn what other people think, which is great. However, others of you may still feel that this is new, and you're not ready to face the judgment of others around something that's this raw and this vulnerable. Perhaps you never will be. be careful, because you would be surprised at how often people will treat something as heavy as going no contact with a narcissistic family system, as though it is just a silly conflict, that could be figured out with some forgiveness and talking it through. Discernment ultimately means figuring out who your safe people are.",

    "output": "Hi everyone it's Dr. Ramani and welcome back to this YouTube channel that takes on all kinds of little and big issues related to narcissistic relationships. some of you are thinking I've watched many of your damn videos lady I get this I really get this now. now I'm gonna let in a way you're kind of screwed once the narcissist knows that. let's take that apart and really lay out what that means for you. this relates to a consistent question I get from people all the time via the comments or emails or whatever is does a narcissist know. Do narcissists know that they're narcissistic or difficult. And maybe even more important is the question of do narcissists really know how insecure they are. Because clearly this person is insecure do they know. The answer to that is ish. Remember that shame rage spiral I talk about often. Narcissistic people aren't demented or frankly delusional. They are able to see that there are consequences to their behavior and they know that their behavior at times is not a good look. But their impulsivity and their entitlement in some ways means that they cannot stop themselves and don't think they should have to. It's as though they will burst if they don't get their nonsense out. It's that tension reduction I talked about. they know that over time their behavior is kind of causing a problem but they will rationalize their behavior, justify their behavior, explain it, defend it. But in a tiny corner of their brains they know what they're doing is probably not a good thing. And sometimes in therapy if they're in therapy they may even admit that they can't stop themselves. It's too uncomfortable. They just need to get it out. And they know it sounds silly if they actually spoke their truth which would be why can't everyone just let me get away with what I have to say. I don't really mean it and I just need to let it out. I think that everyone is out to get me when they don't let me and life is unfair to me and I do always know what's best. Why can't everything just be my way and let me have my tantrum. They can't say that and they know it but that's what's happening.",

That they really pushed a person to the breaking point and that other person they push finally shuts down. This can actually be quite impactful if it happens for example at work or with a lower stakes person. The narcissistic people takes the people closest to them family and partners for granted they may not notice it there. But the idea that someone out there in their world their work world or something doesn't think of them actually really activates their shame. One of the most important things that narcissists do is to make sure that they're not just the person they push to the breaking point. One of the most important things that narcissists do is to make sure that they're not just the person they push to the breaking point. Once they recognize that people are starting to see it and are starting to kind of walk around the narcissist as though the narcissist is unhinged that in essence they sort of feel they're being kind of handled by other people. They don't it because it again it activates shame. But now they're in a catch-22 because at some level they kind of know they're unhinged. it's a big strange circle and at that point you if you're in a relationship with them may slowly work your way to indifference. Once you have the roadmap for narcissism and I'll be frank with you that roadmap is the reason for me even starting this channel. I want to show you every subtle pattern there is you can detect it you can consider Dr. Romani's YouTube channel as narcissism GPS because then the pattern makes sense. You face the hard work of breaking your internal cycles of trauma bonding etc but once you see it you start walking a much bigger circle around them and they start to say oh they see. They may have a wide range of behavior when you start walking that bigger circle and go between rage and trying to show you that they can keep it together and aren't and try to show you I'm actually a nice person.

We were just telling them , stop doing this. And we were expecting them to change. But then when we reunited, we understood anything that we set for a boundary is something we have to enforce.

Because even if I just think, even if I was estranging from my mom, and I'm very close with my mom, but if I was estranging from her because the relationship was unstable, and if I knew she couldn't change and it wasn't a choice, I would go on with more peace. Then, , anger and resentment, my mom was choosing not to get better for me. , and what you're describing is interesting, because I think a lot of people go to individual therapy, and they see a therapist who's been trained in individual modalities. they'll see a psychiatrist or an LCSW or an LPC, a practitioner of counseling. And all of them have been trained in basically a linear way of thinking of , , you do this, and they do this. And if you can't, , set a boundary and make them change, then you're not going to be able to do it. -. And what we do influences, , how the other person responds. And what this does, it gives us a ton of information. ton of power and a ton of clarity on if we're a in this situation, all we can do is change everything on our half. But when we do that, it often influences how the other person responds. And doing things , , being more compassionate understanding of where the other person is coming from, that changes how we interact with them, understanding that they have rejection fears, it changes how we interact with them. And it might invite change on their half.",

And then the bad thing doesn't happen. your brain's , cool, that worked. I'm gonna increase my anxiety and I'm gonna worry more,. That's the anxiety cycle in a very small nutshell. With ADHD, when you aren't thinking about worrying, your brain runs your default mode network. This is the background noise of your brain. And it often just turns to worrying without you noticing it.

And here's where it gets messy. When we have poor executive function, it fuels emotional dysregulation. And when you're highly emotional, it's hard to slow down and think clearly. That's because of the anxiety. And sometimes the fight-flight-freeze response is channeling resources blood and oxygen away from the prefrontal cortex into the more primitive survival parts of your brain. poor executive function can fuel anxiety, and anxiety can fuel poor executive function. This is why ADHD and anxiety are often connected, but they stem from differences in how the brain processes information and responds to stimuli. ADHD stems from poor executive function. Anxiety stems from a healthy brain. Anxiety is a habitual avoidance response. But anxiety can also decrease executive function, it's hard to think clearly when you're scared.

Lastly, it helps to clarify your locus of control. if you have a regret, write it down on a piece of paper, divide the paper in half. These are the things I can change. These are the things I can't change. And just focus on finding solutions or closure for the things that you can change and accepting the things you can. this is how you make regret your best friend.

    "output": "When you finally go no contact with a narcissist, the very first thing they experience is shock. It's not the kind of mild surprise you feel when you lose your keys or forget an appointment. No, this is a seismic jolt to their system. Because for someone who thrives on control, who feeds on attention oxygen, silence is not neutral. It's devastating. They've built their entire identity around the assumption that they have access to you whenever they want it. And the moment you cut that access off, they're left staring into a void they don't know how to manage. Think about this for a second. A narcissist survives on predictable reactions. They poke and you respond. They push and you explain yourself. They withhold and you chase. It's a script. They've rehearsed many times that they believe it's permanent, unshakable. But when you break that script by not responding, by not playing your role, you've just dismantled the entire stage they've been performing on. That's why shock is their immediate reaction. It's pulling the plug on a power source they didn't believe could ever be unplugged. And here's what makes it even more interesting. The shock isn't really about losing you. It's about losing control over you. That distinction matters. Because a narcissist doesn't view relationships the way most people do. They don't see you as an equal partner in a shared human experience. They see you as an extension of themselves, a character in their personal drama, a resource they can tap into when they need validation, admiration. Or even just entertainment. when you go no contact, what they feel is the collapse of their illusion, that they This shock often manifests in ways that are confusing. On the surface, they may appear calm. They may even act indifferent. But beneath that surface is a frantic storm. Because their sense of superiority has been challenged, and nothing rattles a narcissist more than the idea that there is a chance. Probably a sure off effect, but it doesn't inch much away from the Join link toersonic. com. that someone they once controlled is suddenly uncontrollable. The silence becomes a mirror, reflecting back to them the truth they've been running from. They're not as powerful as they think. Now, here's where the psychology gets fascinating. Shock is not just an emotional reaction. It's a threat to their very identity.",

    "output": "What makes this dynamic fascinating is that the narcissist shock is not just about losing a person. It's about losing certainty. Human beings crave certainty. We to know how things will unfold. For narcissists, certainty comes from knowing how you'll react. When you disrupt that predictability, you force them into a state of chaos. And narcissists hate chaos when they're not the ones creating it. The silence becomes a question they can't answer. Why aren't they responding. Why aren't they chasing me. Why aren't they falling into the trap this time. And the more they ask those questions, the more the shock deepens into panic, into anger, into the slow recognition that something has changed permanently. And here's where the philosophy of the narcissist shock is. The philosophy comes in shock is a signal of awakening. Not for them, for you. Because their shock is a mirror of your courage. It's evidence that you finally did the one thing they didn't think you could do walk away. And in that silence, you begin to hear something you couldn't hear before. The sound of your own strength. when you wonder how they're reacting, remember this. Their shock is not a signal of awakening. It's a signal of awakening. It's not your problem to solve. Their shock is simply confirmation that your silence has power. You've disrupted their illusion. And in doing , you've reclaimed your life. And maybe that's the ultimate truth. The shock they feel is temporary. But the freedom you gain is permanent. After the initial shock wears off, something deeper begins to take over inside the narcissist panic. And not just ordinary panic. It's the kind of inner turbulence that comes from realizing the thing you've relied on. The supply you've depended on has been cut off completely. See, for a narcissist, you weren't just a partner, a friend, or a family member. You were their source of oxygen. You gave them the attention, the validation, and the drama that kept their ego alive. And when you go no contact, it's pulling the plug on their life cycle. And that's what you're doing. You're not just a partner. You're a family member. You're a life support system. At first, they'll try to cover it up with that same mask they always wear. They'll act indifferent, maybe even smug, as if they don't notice your absence.",

Your only responsibility is to protect your peace and keep moving forward. the next time you imagine what's happening on the other side of that silence, remind yourself they're panicking because they've lost control. They're scrambling because they don't know what's going on. And that's when you're in a situation where you don't have to soothe it, explain it, or fix it. You're not here to regulate their emotions, especially they underestimated you. And while they're trapped in their cycle of desperation, you're stepping into freedom. Once the panic sets in and their first attempts to break your silence fail, the narcissist inevitably shifts into a new mode, anger and denial. It's watching a pendulum swing back and forth, not because they're thinking clearly, but because they're desperately trying to find footing in a reality they can't control. And when narcissists lose control, rage is their go to weapon. That anger isn't random. It's rooted in entitlement. For long, they've believed that you exist to respond to them, to give them attention, to play a role in their story. when you refuse to respond, it doesn't just frustrate them. It offends them. It feels in their mind. They see your silence not as a healthy boundary, but as a personal attack. That's why they lash out. That's why they'll smear your name, twist the truth, or create entire narratives where they're the victim and you're the villain. Because anger for them is a way to reassert dominance. But alongside that anger comes something more subtle denial. Deep down, narcissists, are terrified of admitting they've lost you. Admitting loss would mean admitting failure, and failure is something their ego simply cannot process. instead, they rewrite the story in their heads. They tell themselves you're just playing hard to get. They convince themselves you'll eventually come crawling back. They project confidence, even arrogance, as if they're the ones who chose to walk away. And this denial is a way to reassert dominance. And they're not just playing hard to get. This denial is their shield. It protects them from facing the truth, that you have taken back your power. Now, here's where it gets psychologically fascinating. Anger and denial are not signs of strength.",

    "output": "They're signs of weakness. They're defense mechanisms. When someone is truly secure, they don't need to lash out, and they don't need to lie to themselves. But the narcissist, stripped of their usual control, has no tools left except rage and self-deception. This cycle, anger followed by denial, then back to anger again, reveals the fragility underneath their mask. Think about how many times you may have seen this play out in small ways before. Maybe you tried to set a boundary in the past, asking for space or refusing to engage in an argument. Their first response, anger. Their second response, is this. Pretending it didn't matter. Pretending they weren't bothered. Now magnify that dynamic by 10. That's what happens when no contact is held for a long period. The silence becomes unbearable, the anger spikes. The anger feels unsustainable. the denial kicks in. Back and forth, they go, trapped in a cycle of emotions they can't regulate. Here's the dangerous part during this phase. Their behavior often escalates. They might try to damage your reputation, spreading lies to mutual friends, colleagues, or even family. They might invent stories designed to paint themselves as the victim, because if they can't control you directly, they'll try to control how others see you. This is classic narcissistic rage, vindictive, disproportionate, and aimed at punishing you for daring to defy them. And yet, all of it stems from one thing, the fact that your silence has forced them into a corner they can't escape. Now, on a philosophical level, this is where we see the contrast between illusion and reality. The narcissist lives inside an illusion of superiority. In their mind, they are always the center of the story. But your no-contact boundary exposes the reality they don't control everything, and they don't control you. The anger is their attempt to fight reality. The denial is their attempt to escape it. And what's remarkable is that the longer you maintain your silence, the more that illusion unravels. One of the hardest things to accept, though, is that their anger and denial will sometimes be directed outward, toward you, and sometimes turned inward, toward themselves. They may tell themselves you never matter. But then, in private moments, they'll rage at the fact that they can't get you back. They may convince others that they're over you.",

And this is where the silence you've maintained begins to echo the loudest. Because in the long stretch of no contact, they can't outrun the truth anymore. They've lost something they thought they'd always have you. At first, they won't want to call it loss. They'll label it stubbornness on your part or a temporary phase. They'll tell themselves you'll come back, that eventually you'll break, that you can't possibly live without them. But weeks turn into months, and those stories stop holding up. And little by little, a realization creeps in. They start to see that this time is different. This time, the silence isn't a tactic. It isn't a pause. It's permanent. And for the narcissist, permanence is devastating. Because narcissists live in cycles. Idealize, devalue, discard, hoover, repeat. They don't think in terms of endings, only loops. But no contact breaks the loop. It introduces a finality they didn't believe existed. And when they realize the loop is broken, when they see that you are no longer playing your role, they're forced into an awareness. They've spent their entire lives avoidings. They can lose people, and they can lose control. This realization is not just painful for them. It's humiliating. Narcissists build their entire identity on superiority, on the belief that they're untouchable, that no one could ever walk away from them for good. when the silence stretches on, and they begin to recognize that you're gone, it punctures their grand illusion. It tells them something they don't want to admit. They are replaceable. And they are forgettable. And for someone who thrives on the fantasy of being the center of every story, that truth cuts deeper than anything else. What's striking here is the irony. Because many times, narcissists only start to grasp your worth when it's already too late. While you were present, while you were giving, while you were forgiving, they couldn't see it. They were too consumed with their need for control. But once the silence removes you from their reach, once the no-contact boundary solidifies into distance, they finally see the vacuum left behind.",

Their pride won't allow it. They'll bury the realization under layers of hope. They'll bury it. They'll bury it. layers of arrogance or distract themselves with new sources of supply. They'll tell stories that minimize your importance or exaggerate how they're doing without you, but behind closed doors in the quiet moments that lost gnaws at them. Because deep down, they know the truth. You were never supposed to get away and you did. Psychologically, this is the collapse of their illusion. Philosophically, it's a moment of reckoning. Loss forces us all to confront what we value, what we took for granted, what we thought was permanent but wasn't. For most people, that kind of reckoning is an opportunity for growth. For a narcissist, it's agony. Because growth would require humility, self-reflection, and accountability. Qualities they resist at all costs. instead of growing, they often spiral. The regret seeps in, but it's twisted by bitterness. They miss you, but they resent you for leaving. They recognize your worth, but they can't bring themselves to honor it. It's a paradox they'll wrestle with in silence. But here's the beauty in all of this, their realization of loss is not your burden to carry. It's not your responsibility to soothe their regret or to comfort their ego. That realization belongs to them, and it stays with them. Your responsibility is to recognize what this stage means for you. It means you've succeeded in breaking free from the cycle. It means you've created a boundary firm, consistent, that it's forced someone who once believed they owned your attention to face the reality of your absence. And that is powerful. Because the truth is, no contact, doesn't just teach the narcissist about loss. It teaches you about freedom. It teaches you that you don't have to be a character in someone else's script. It teaches you that your silence is a statement of self-worth, a declaration that you are no longer available to manipulation. And when the narcissist finally realizes what they've lost, what you gain is clarity. Clarity about your own strength, your own self-worth, and your own self-worth. Clarity about your own strength, your own self-worth.",

And you realize in that same silence that you never need their validation in the first place. That's why this stage, as painful as it might be for them, is liberating for you. Because while they're consumed with regret and emptiness, you're no longer in their storm. You've stepped out of the cycle, out of the chaos, into a life where your value is defined by you, not by someone else's inability to see it. And maybe that's the final victory in all of this.

    "output": "Hi Dr. Ramani, thanks for being here. What is betrayal trauma. betrayal trauma is a series of reactions that a person will experience, psychological and emotional reactions that a person will experience after a pretty significant and protracted period of betrayal in a close or significant relationship. sort of a classical example of betrayal trauma would be, it's not as simple as just somebody cheated on you, but you come to find out they've been cheating on you for 15 years, or they have a child with this other person, or all those years or months or whatever you suspected they were cheating on you, and you keep bringing it up something doesn't feel , and they're don't be ridiculous, and they come up with all these alibis and gaslight and all of that. It's this fallout that comes after somebody who's been significantly betrayed. It could be something that's a public betrayal, that somebody, it's not just an infidelity, but maybe an infidelity with a family member, sleeping with your sister kind of thing, or they're behaving in a really inappropriate way in a public way that could bring shame upon a family. and again, it tends not to be sort of a one-off. It's something that may have been going on for a very long time, and then a person comes to find out there was this whole big story behind the betrayal. It wasn't just this one thing. It was this whole constellation, this whole combination of things that kind of came together, and it's really destabilizing for a person who goes through it. Is the term or phrase betrayal trauma something that's being used by clinicians, or is this a layman's term. No, no, it's something that clinicians use, and it's, I often view betrayal trauma as something that's very tightly linked in with complex trauma.",

It's not that, and you're kind of sad,. where this come from, but there is no other person. You really truly did grow apart. This is something very, very different, sort of deceit upon deceit upon deceit. I understand that. how does somebody respond differently from a betrayal trauma versus a more standard trauma, we're getting a divorce, that can be traumatic, that's a big deal, but it's not worth it. I mean, I think that what gets tricky is , again, this word trauma, and without belaboring it, is , where do we use it.

I think though somebody waking up one day and recognizing that for years, their trust has been violated in a fundamental way. What they thought life to be simply wasn't life. Things that they suspected, that almost elevates it a bit more to a trauma, because it's much. It can affect a person standing in the community and on and on. I think that the nature of betrayal, that fundamental violation of trust, people growing apart isn't a violation of trust.

You might even see some of the sort of the patterns you'd see in sort of post-trauma of sort of difficulty concentrating, sort of a feeling of being on edge, being very hypervigilant, very aware of everything that's happening.

Let's move into some solutions for this therapeutic interventions for betrayal trauma. What do we have that you. I would say if somebody is going through betrayal trauma, step one is to have a place to vent and talk about it again and again and again. What clinicians need to understand is that these are folks who are experiencing a massive sense of trauma. And that's what we're talking about. And we're talking about the sense of injustice and there's nothing we can do to make them feel whole. part of it is letting them, because I do believe that if we let a person say something over and over again, they kind of off gas it. There's a dialysis that takes place. You just, because I think over time, unfortunately, a lot of people going through betrayal trauma, a lot of their social supports do get burned out after a while. I cannot listen to this again. Nothing is changing. And they may say , I can't, I just can't do this anymore. And that's not going to change. I can't do this anymore. Whereas a therapist that's there, that's what they do. And , and did not judge that. I think that people just need to keep going. And then at some point, even just with the advantage of time, things may shift. But if the betrayal trauma is one where stuff keeps coming up, more revelations are made. It can be a really drawn out process. The other is that the therapy becomes a place to process the grief. A person is grieving a life they thought they had, a relationship they thought they had. It's not nobody's dead. this is a very difficult kind of grief. It's a, it's, , it's, it's something that Pauline boss sometimes calls ambiguous grief is this idea of it's everyone's saying, , I get grief or they're not dead. , you can move on. It would all actually been easier if the person was dead because then it's not, they're not out there living in their new betrayal future kind of thing.",

It's almost having your house burned down. , you had a house and now you don't have a house anymore. And I, I, I think that it's very important that in therapy, that grief process gets to unfold because we often give short shrift to people who are going through betrayal trauma. The world may sometimes look at these as people scorned. Oh, they're just her. Cause this person, no, it's much more than that. fundamental truths in their life have been utterly violated. And it's it's therapy becomes a very patient process of letting the grief unfold of empathizing with the client and recognizing that this is an injustice, that there's no magic wand we can wave over this to make it. And then simultaneous to that, a lot of betrayal trauma is perpetrated by people who are sociopathic, psychopathic, narcissistic, manipulative. And some of it becomes a psycho education about what those personality styles are. And sometimes that helps people have a framework. they don't feel as lost. Are there any therapeutic modalities CBT that you would recommend. I think one of the challenges becomes is that, , CBT is change how you think about this,. The person's , I don't even know how to think about this. Is that, , first of all betrayed you they've betrayed you. And if it's been going on a long time, it feels terrible. I do think that just creating a safe holding space more that we'd see in more of a humanistic style of letting. Person talk it out. I do think an eclectic approach would be absolutely essential here, where you get at some of the historical issues around betrayal. This may be mirroring a betrayal from childhood.

How do I fix it and then I realized that the only way to fix it was to really get inside my subconscious mind and Recognize the patterns that were running around in my head the behaviors that were habitual The my triggers the way that I responded to people my emotional set point I talked about the emotional set point in quantum tools to help you heal your life now.

    "output": "What is family mobbing and how does this relate to family scapegoating abuse. That's what I'll be talking about in today's episode of family scapegoating abuse. stick around Hey everyone, welcome to my channel. I'm Rebecca Mandeville, licensed psychotherapist, family scapegoating abuse expert, and the author of Rejected, Shamed, and Blamed, Help and Hope for Adults in the Family Scapegoat Role. Today I'm going to be talking about family mobbing. Before I do that, I want to emphasize once again that family scapegoating abuse is systemic in nature. It's driven by systemic problems. Even if it just appears only one person is behind those scapegoating behaviors that you may have been a target of if you're here watching this video. Family mobbing is also systemic, and you actually may have experienced family mobbing and didn't even know it. I want to define it for you today, and I'll start off first by saying where we even got the term, because it's a very common term. It's a term that's used in many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, because I think it's important to cite and attribute the work of others. In this case, family mobbing is a term that spun off from the term workplace mobbing, and that came from the research of Dr. Heinz Lehmann, L-E-Y-M-A-N-N. If you want to know more about his work on workplace mobbing, that's on my website, familymobbing. org. That form of systemic mobbing, you can look up his research and see what he had to say about it. This is why it's always good to give proper attribution, which frankly I don't see going on enough in the media circles I'm involved with, because this gives people the freedom to go to the source. some of the behaviors that you associate with family scapegoating abuse, at times with narcissistic abuse, gaslighting, reality distortion, harassment, cyberbullying, feeling left out of the family, being covertly pushed away from the hub of the family, or being overtly pushed out of the family, as I said in a video a while back, what the dysfunctional family cannot control or understand, it will eject and reject.",

I want to talk about something that I feel is critically important because when I did a search. I was looking at the search results on family mobbing and coping strategies for survivors. I was just curious to see what was being said out there. You either laugh or you cry because what was mostly there was, go to family therapy and communicate your feelings and la, la, la. It was not based in reality. I say this as someone who's literally worked with hundreds and hundreds of families in addiction treatment centers and in my private practice. I understand what's happening with families, dysfunctional families and the kind of dynamics that they're experiencing and that are affecting and influencing their behaviors. If you have someone who's scapegoated and experiencing family mobbing dynamics, go in to a family therapy session. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the scapegoated. Their family member is the scapegoat. You just need to know what's going on and what's the problem. And the scapegoat and family member will more than likely be mobbed in the family therapy session. in my article, I did make an important note that I feel this type of advice is dangerous. I feel it can retraumatize the FSA adult survivor. If for any reason, and you may have a very good reason, you feel you want to do family systems therapy, have your own therapist work with you. for quite some time first, make sure they understand family systems, family scapegoating dynamics. And if you both decide it's a good idea for you to go to a family therapy session, take that therapist with you. You need an ally in that room and that therapist should consult with the family therapist prior to the session to ensure that you're protected and measures will be taken immediately to stop any type of mobbing dynamics. What coping strategies are available for you if you experience family mobbing dynamics.",

And the sensitivity shown in the comments made me feel privileged that I get to do these videos and meet all of you. And we all have much in common.

I wonder what I want and all sorts of opportunities to come back with. I thought, , , there's some symbology here because part of what I'm doing in sharing my experiences, as a clinician, as a researcher on what I call family scapegoating abuse or FSA. I'm hoping to broaden and expand your perspective, not only to have better clinical in your dysfunctional or narcissistic family, but also to give you a sense of hope that you can expand beyond the scapegoat narrative, that damaging false narrative that sticks to you feather onto tar, and you can expand beyond the pain, that deep soul pain, of being the scapegoat in your family of origin. That doesn't mean we don't feel the pain at times, but knowing that we cared enough to feel something, that we have enough humanity to feel sad regarding missed connections, or lost connections, or connections you may have felt you never ever had. And those of you who may have come across the clinical term attachment trauma, you may have an early sense of missed connection, to speak, and attachment trauma, betrayal trauma, those are all a part of the trauma.

In no way would this fall into any kind of unconscious scapegoating. Someone has something to hide. Something needs to be covered up. There's a secret.

Are they a believable reporter, reliable reporter. there's a, a conscious intentional need to make the abused family member, the unreliable reporter. And that would go not just for sexual abuse, although that's where I can see it, where the campaign starts very early on in a child's life, but it can be also from emotional and mental abuse and physical. imagine what that child's going through. And those of you who've been through it, you don't have to imagine it sadly. Six, nuclear or extended family members, or even non-family members were informed by a parent or primary caregiver that you were a troubled problem child and were difficult to deal with and not to be trusted or believed.

It is an implicit survival strategy to regard the parent as essentially a good caretaker. And that's what we're doing. That's what we're doing. That's what we're doing. That's what we're doing. That's what we're doing. That's what we're doing. This sometimes leads to what's called splitting. That it's we have one parent who is the bad parent, who is only bad. And the other parent in our mind is the good parent. And rather than being able to hold them together, they split into those parts. let's look at the second major cause of shame, which is being ostracized from a group, be it family, colleagues, friends. Or peers. Rejection is among the most painful of human emotions. Anyone who has felt the sting of rejection, ostracism, or shunning knows how deeply these experiences sting and how they just rip us apart. And also how long that pain can last. This shame feels death because we're not the same. In tribal or primitive groupings, if one member is being ostracized for not living up to, not obeying the norms of the group, they may perish. For example, if a member of a primate family group is banished or shunned, they may literally die. And if they're not able to attach to another group, they will simply wither and die. the voodoo death. It's not about putting the needle in the hole. It's not about putting the needles in the doll. It's about ostracizing that person who's being hexed. And because that's severe and the body gets shut down, they may actually perish and die, but again, not by the needles, but by the banishment and how profoundly that immobilizes us. And , the mind makes us particularly vulnerable to shame around the age of adolescence. At this age, peer groups become vitally important and exclusion feels you're dying of shame and shame and humiliation. If you kind of visit your adolescence and your pre-adolescence, how did it feel when you were excluded by high school friends or colleagues or family members. It can just be excruciating for any of us.",

    "output": "Hi, my name is Dr. Fox, licensed psychologist in the state of Texas, and in this video we're going to discuss a very hard topic, abusive relationship. I'm going to discuss the four main categories of an emotionally abusive relationship, which can be a very complex dynamic and not always easy to identify when you're in it until you're deep in it. We will then identify the 10 signs of an abusive relationship, as what you can do about it and how you can heal from it. Please , share, subscribe, and let's take a look at the components of abusive relationships. In cases of psychological abuse, also known as emotional abuse, the abuser uses words and actions to frighten, control, and isolate their partner. Emotional abuse includes the following categories and signs of abusive behavior. The first is humiliation. This is insulting, criticizing, name-calling, embarrassing the other person in public, belittling their accomplishments, posting unflattering photos and videos of them on social media. That's humiliation. There's control. This is acting jealous and possessive, monitoring the other person's behavior, reading their texts and emails, demanding all their time and attention, pressuring them to use drugs or alcohol, using social media to track their activities, trying to control who they follow on social media. That is an act of측 Those are called a sexual abuse behavior that labels somebody who is really, if you can think about it, akhir fellowship. This is all reallyج Nordic and not sexual in the textile industry,ser 사람Õä nutritionistä social media aging off ïä ääÄáticaI control. Blaming and gaslighting. This is accusing the other person of cheating, denying abusive behavior, or blaming it on the victim. Claiming their problems are the other person's fault. That's blaming and gaslighting. The next one and the last one in this category is neglect and isolation. This is refusing to communicate, turning other people against the victim, withholding affection, preventing the other person from seeing friends or family. That is neglect and isolation. those are those four main categories. Now we're going to get into what the 10 signs of an abusive relationship are. As we go through this, ask yourself, am I in this type of relationship. Am I experiencing this. Now you can give yourself a range if you want. One is perhaps definitely no. Five can be definitely yes. Three is not too sure.",

    "output": "you're not sure what you're sorry for in order to prevent their anger and complaints number three that's you don't talk about the relationship with your friends or family you avoid discussing the other person you minimize their abusive behavior or make excuses for it if your friends or family members call it out now number four is your partner love bombs you now this is when they try to make up for abusive behavior with repairing behavior that includes exaggerated compliments extravagant gifts or trips or telling you that they can't live without you it's important to remember that abuse is rarely 100 of the time a lot of times there is repairing behavior in an abusive relationship in the abusive cycle what happens is you have the abuse that occurs and that may happen for a while then you have the repairing then you may have a period of dormancy where there isn't really any abuse things maybe are tense but everyone kind of stays away from one another whatever it may be and then the abuse occurs again for whatever that may be then after the abuse is done then you have the repairing behavior which is again the love bombs that i just mentioned number five you feel everything that's wrong with the relationship is your fault emotional abuse often includes convincing the other person that they need to be criticized and told what to do but they're not going to be able to do it because they're not going to be able to do it because they're not going to be able to do it because they're not going to be able to do it because they're not going to do it because of their poor behavior and decision making ability and if they were better there wouldn't be a problem in the relationship number six is your disagreements turn into intense fights this rather than being productive arguments blow up into yelling and insults that feel very threatening and very scary number seven this is you never know which version of your partner you're gonna get very unpredictable they're hot and cold sometimes they're up and down sometimes withdrawing or insulting and then they draw you back in by being suddenly attentive and loving remember the love bombs of number four and a lot of times this can be what i to call narcissistic tease strategy which is at first they abuse you and they make you feel low which makes the narcissist feel very strong and powerful then once that person or if that person is able to is felt low enough small enough then they decide to leave then what happens is the narcissist or a lot of them can be very charming and very loving or they're very good at reading others and what they need then they see that they start to play on that then the person who was experiencing the abuse the receiver of the abuse then it's oh maybe he or she's changed and they go back and then again you end up on that cycle number eight you get shut down when you try to communicate the other person dismisses your needs or concerns or responds to them with sarcasm and disgust number nine you've lost confidence in your own perspective you've been told many times that you're wrong stupid or crazy that you've started to believe it remember whatever we tell ourselves over and over again will eventually be ingested and become part of our perception this can go for the negative certainly but it can also go for the positive try to catch those negatives replace them with positives balance thoughts about yourself genuine caring thoughts about yourself and the last one number 10 is you've forgotten what you used to be before the relationship you no longer spend time on your own doing things you care about or spending time with close friends that you don't remember what it felt to be a strong and independent person now some folks have never felt a strong and independent person i think in those instances what we need to do is we need to revisit how we would imagine ourselves or initially visit how we would imagine ourselves to be that strong and independent person what would that be what are those components get as concrete and clear as you can in what are those traits what are those traits that you admire in other people that seem strong and independent how can you get those traits learning different ways of thinking and behaving it doesn't always happen after you go to a place a first level instance a new experience some people go to other schools because they're feeling very depressed they feel the same as somebody whatever that wall is really hard to understand what's happening but really i think it's really important to build that relationship with your interactions by analyzing the ресur業's counterfle gestellt v what's happening what's happening in social interactions what's happening in communityındews and close anymorenonevenet corpo and happened challenging those things and doing those things differently if you answer yes and feel you're in an abusive relationship it's important to take steps to repair the damage that's done to your self-worth self-confidence independence and ability to trust others recovering from emotional abuse starts with recognizing that the abuse took place rather than minimizing or denying it to yourself the next step is to start challenging those mental patterns that are linked to the abuse we just talked about those a lot of those self-degrading comments and statements now this can also include shifting negative thoughts and beliefs such as thinking the abuse was your fault that you will never be in a healthy relationship or that you could have done something different that would have prevented the abuse in addition healing from an emotionally abusive relationship involves honoring your own needs and desires by doing what you love and what makes you true and that's what I'm talking about here today this is the most important thing that you need to know about yourself you need to be aware of your own needs and desires by doing what you love and what makes you true and that's what I'm talking about here today is to start thinking about how to improve your emotional abuse.",

It's pain that gets turned into growth. But what happens to a child that can't resolve it. Nobody's supporting them. Nobody's giving them tools to handle it. It turns into trauma. They're a victim. They're legitimate victim, a helpless victim who can't fix the problem. , and they are legitimate victims. The problem is, is that they still feel a victim as an adult, even though they're not a victim now, they now have tools and support and that's. One of the hardest transitions is to move from, I was a legit legitimate victim, but now I gotta take responsibility cuz I can. And some don't wanna do that cuz they staying a victim cuz then I don't have to be responsible if people feel sorry for me, I can blame somebody. I don't have to grow up. It's fascinating. Let's talk about trauma. Let's talk about complex trauma. what is it. How would we say what it is. trauma is. Is the event happens on the outside, but I can't handle it. It's too painful. It's too scary for me. it creates this fear and stress that I don't have the tools to handle. And as a result of that, since I can't fix it and resolve it, it then wounds me on the inside and that's the trauma is what takes place on the inside. What makes why we call it complex trauma. it's really mathematical terms. it's. There's simple math and there's complex math. simple is one number complex is more than one. simple trauma is a one event trauma, a car accident, a rape, whatever complex is ongoing danger. a child's in a situation where they're in ongoing danger. there's their stress system is constantly activated. do I fight flight. What do I do here. I gotta get out of here. I can't handle this. I can't handle this. that when a child lives in that environment. All, all the time where they're constantly activated to fight flight. But if they're too little to fight or flight, then they eventually go, oh, I'm shutting her down. Freeze. I can't handle this.",

Two extreme ends of the spectrum. the abuse we can easily imagine that's physical abuse, emotional abuse, that's harsh environment, violence, et cetera. But a lot of complex trauma comes out of neglect. And that's the other end of the spectrum where all the physical needs of the child were met, but their emotional needs were met. the abuse trauma, something happens to you, neglect trauma, something didn't happen to you that should have happened. And it's hard to find out those, the neglect trauma. Sometimes it's hard to locate some of it because it's almost feeling around for ghosts is what it feels. Exactly. And that's where we spend a lot of time. what we've done with it is that we've broken down kind of the emotional needs that a child has. we have a need to be a, a child needs to be authentic and to connect with safe people and really be able to be vulnerable and open up and to be totally accepted for who they are, have somebody who totally gets them and hears them and. Sees them and values them and nurtures them. Those are all emotional needs. But if a child grows up in a home where I'm too busy for you or smarten up, get over it, toughen up, nobody's getting them. Nobody's hearing them. Or why can't you be your brother, et cetera. All of that is emotional trauma. That's hurting the child emotionally. the child's not feeling safe to be them. the child then has to adapt in order to try. To protect itself. I gotta be tougher. I can't be sensitive. I gotta wear this mask of being outgoing, et cetera. , but that's also how I'm gonna try to get my needs met. maybe if I'm different, then dad will give me more attention.

The child just doesn't feel loved and accepted. they, they don't feel safe. They don't feel they can totally relax. They have to somehow earn that connection, earn that love.

I have value. I, I have something to offer to the world. A child with complex trauma that's felt neglected. It's my fault. I must not be good enough.

Is forming with all this negative stuff. , and that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, and that's a real tragedy of complex trauma. Is it shaping the brain in the infant years with negative messages, lies, negative perceptions that you're not even aware of there. You just think are normal. And those can be a parent not looking at its child. Exactly. And not interacting. Exactly. There's probably countless things that could create trauma at that age,. Exactly. what we know is a child, needs to feel safe. They need lots of hugs and touches. They need eye contact. That's how they learn to regulate. That's how they learn to feel and experience emotions by picking up on the parents emotions. That's how their emotions get calmed by looking into somebody who's calm. , but if they don't have that, then it's , it's me against the big bad world. And I'm only one week old. it's, it's too overwhelming. It's too scary. You got to be a gangster suddenly. And you're only seven days old. Exactly. And you can't even carry a gun. Exactly. Exactly. And that's a lot of pressure.",

I think it's really helpful to understand trauma. , you really need to understand our central nervous system. And it's really made up of two parts. there's the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic. the sympathetic is your work energy. , it gives you the energy to fight or flight, to work hard, get up in the morning, go, go, go. But then you need a parasympathetic, a balancing part. That's your rest, healing, restoration piece. a child has to have that in balance to be healthy, to grow. But what happens in complex trauma when you're in danger all the time is you're in your sympathetic all the time. Because you got to be on guard. You got to be going. You got to get validation. You got to prove yourself. You got to work. You got to earn. you got to go, go, go. You're driven. And, and the brain helps you with that. It releases cortisol when fear is in your stress system activated, and that releases adrenaline. you can go on adrenaline. That gives you lots of energy. And you feel, hey, I can pull this off. And if you're young, you've got the resources to do that. But the problem is you're not engaging your parasympathetic. mesmo Edit Sentimental Fase.",

That deep loneliness, the deep pain, the deep emptiness, that deep longing to feel connected, all of those drugs seem to solve that for them.

I was in part of Canada where all the treatment centers were talking about trauma, and we got to be trauma-informed. And I asked them, is anybody willing to change their program. And none of them were. And I had started, some addicts asked me to start a Friday night thing where I'd started teaching this stuff. that's where these videos started. I started 17 years ago teaching around what I was learning and started with 50 addicts coming out, and it grew and grew and grew. , your channel's fascinating, man.

Some even sleep with a weapon nearby in case something happens. That's crazy. And. And I think of my stuff. My child is pretty light when I think about what some kids could go through. , mine was really more neglect. It wasn't any abuse, , but it was just wandering around in a fucking. At an empty Costco with a fucking name tag on.",

    "output": "wondering where the manager was anyway sorry sometimes I'm still I still have a lot of anger about it's been hard to process over the years no but to me you should and if I can just speak to that because to me what happens in a lot of complex trauma families is anger is seen as bad you're always punished for anger though when you think about anger is actually designed to be something good if something violates love somebody lies to me or somebody cheats on me I should get angry because what they're doing is going to destroy the relationship if they don't fix it anger is actually a healthy thing that motivates me to act to say hey this isn't this is this is wrong but in complex trauma that gets knocked down never validated judged and part of the healing journey for a lot of people is being able to validate their anger I should be angry because that was crap I shouldn't have been neglected that now I'm not gonna stay there I'm not gonna feed it and turn it into deep bitterness but I need to let that anger be honest if I'm gonna heal yes sometimes as an adult I feel I'm healed from it sometimes but I still feel that kid is not happy exactly that's literally what it feels sometimes he comes up to the surface of my fucking throat yes literally he'll be just playing in the distance and he'll run up and yell out exactly just out of the I cannot it's exactly and I say that's where he's at I'm saying we're gonna cheat trying to work with him but I think a lot of my a lot of my anger now is from I have unrealistic realistic expectations of people of myself yes I didn't even realize it literally to three or four days ago somebody brought it to my attention man my brother and i was oh my gosh i've had him since i was my whole life i've had this to-do list that i don't even know i feel every day i'm already behind schedule and i don't have a schedule that's what every single i'm running behind gotta do this what is it i don't know but we better get we i gotta do it and that's how i am no and nothing no one can ever do anything perfect enough to tie that in with what you just shared what we found with most people with complex trauma is what they begin to realize is it's there's a part of them that got left behind that's still a child some refer to as their inner child but the little boy that's still down there and some have a whole bunch of little boys that are different ages and different that person is a politician exactly but anyways what they've realized is they there's a part of them that kind of hates that little boy and wishes you shut up and then quit bugging them and grow up and all of that kind of treats them they were treated and they have to learn to love and nurture that little boy because that's part of them and just welcome them make space for them be curious what's going on why are you upset i'm not going to judge you just help me understand and then help them process through it because nobody helped them process through it and eventually that little boy can heal and that's a useful tool for a lot of people is beginning to go let's welcome that little boy and parent that little boy even though it's me but it's part of me and it's a part of me that got wounded if somebody's sitting there now and they're oh i'm gonna go to the hospital and they're oh i'm gonna go to the hospital and they're oh i'm gonna go to the hospital now he's listening and they're how would you start to have some of that conversation with yourself and is there a certain setting you would kind of do it in just to even try and get us some awareness of that inner child as people say a lot of it's different for everybody and you got to kind of find what works for you what some people do is they can go in their imagination to kind of a safe place in their house that they liked as a kid or a safe place in their house that they liked as a kid or a safe place in their house that they liked place in the backyard or a tree or something in the woods whatever and they can go there and kind of picture that little child and connect with that little child others can do it through going through picture albums see when they're four years old when they're seven years old i remember what i was feeling then and what i was thinking or the other one is when they get triggered and that voice in their head and they go that how old do i feel now and they go i feel three i feel eight and it's let's connect with that part of me and that's that part of the your limbic brain that's been triggered which doesn't keep track of time that's still stuck at that age wow that's a great point when that's happening that part of you is showing up exactly that's as crazy as it is it's a great time to be able to do that and i think that's a great point and i think that's a great point to connect what i say to people is a trigger don't get down on yourself if you get triggered go a trigger is my little boy saying ouch and be curious and go it's trying to get my attention saying there's a wound here that never has been going on buddy exactly i went to this center for a week it was in this was in scottsdale it was about sexual health not necessarily about actual physical act of sex but it emotional health emotional wellness all that and we had to go get a doll from a dang baby oh build-a-bears we roll up and build a bears dude a couple i mean we gotta have a white van and went in there obviously we look politicians we have burps definitely burps one of us definitely a peeping tom give it out candy at the back we look flashers that had gone on a field trip that's what we look we look definitely and then we're in there buying doll and there's these other there's other people there's kids in there getting it was just the whole thing was just bizarre but then you'd have to sit with this dang doll and just talk to and every now and then there was some moments of you could almost feel a doll just be hey man just sit here with me for a little bit you could almost feel it was a feeling you would get hey just stay with me for a minute man if i if i was when i was a kid if somebody just stayed with me for a minute made a big difference man i can't even i mean a minute it just would have had a it would have made me feel somebody wants to be there with me i just never i can't believe i even i'm not trying to have self-pity but i just can't believe that shit man and i'm fortunate that we had food and stuff on the table i can't imagine in places where kids don't have that or don't have a sibling to at least come in the room and make them smile or something man it's heartbreaking it is they should have a program when you leave the hospital with your child that there's what i'm saying even a basic hey look in your child's eyes this is how you do this these are the these are four things do they have anything that they're starting to oh what's her name she's out of san francisco she just wrote a book called the deepest now it's a good book and she's been very much involved with ace which is at adverse childhood experiences the is that a test you take oh i think i and she's 10 questions or something and she's she was a pediatrician in san francisco nadine burke harris is her name she's moved up the ranks in san francisco and she's started parenting courses for people desmond two who said we got to stop pulling people out of the room river we got to go down river and stop them from getting pushed in the river and that's what this is all about we got to start working with parents we've actually we're actually developing a parenting course that we're piloting now just because it's it's great work helping people get healthy in their 40s and 50s but we got help parents not pass this on we got to fix it and try to help at the beginning some let me think and what were we just talking about before the ACEs the ACEs quiz here this is a fascinating I took this test in a treatment facility and it blew my mind let's go back just a little bit I just want to read the top what to know before you take the quiz researchers determined that ten specific traumatic childhood experiences or ACEs could be linked to a higher likelihood of health challenges later in life and that the likelihood of these negative effects increased with the number of ACEs a child experienced Tim you want to take us in a little further the whole these were really developed with a focus mainly on abuse and we still use it because it's very important to know what the negative effects are and what the negative effects are and we still use it because it's very effective but it's that hidden neglect stuff it touches on but it doesn't develop and most professionals now use this test but then we add other stuff to help people capture some of the neglect stuff but what basically has come out of the itÂåóEricÅà fidgÉapÉëÉµ self-test is through years of tracking people with it is if you have two aces or three aces or six aces or seven aces.",

There's actually a video now on YouTube. Where a guy's actually built a bike that operates backwards. when you think of a bike, you learn to ride a bike at four or five, six years old. And at first you got to concentrate a lot to get your balance, to turn the steering wheel. Oh. Remember how loose the, remember how crazy the beginning is. You're falling and, but you keep working and concentrating. Oh. You fall. Somebody's dad calls you a G-A-Y every time. You're what. And then pretty soon you could be talking to your buddies and. And you're not even thinking about riding, but you're, it's, it moves from your conscious brain to a subconscious program that just operates. And now you could go without riding a bike for 30 years and jump back on and you'd ride it without even thinking. You'd just pick it back up. this guy built a bike where if you turn the handlebars to the left, you actually, the wheel goes to the. Oh my gosh. Why did he do it. Was he angry at somebody. He wanted to test how quickly could you relearn to ride a bike. Wow. how long it took. Six months to a year. No. you're just saying to relearn things, it takes a while. It takes some time. Exactly. Especially when you learn it young. And if somebody's just going to therapy,. What can they go talk to. How can they start a conversation with their therapist that could help them create more ambiance around maybe some of the stuff that may have happened and how it affects them now. a lot of people go to therapy now because of a crisis in the present.",

Cause shame says I deserve to beat myself up cause I'm a loser and often complex trauma parenting is. The way to motivate a child to want to change and be better is to beat them up and put them down and punish them. And then they're going to want to prove you wrong or, but that doesn't work in the long run. Eventually you start to believe you are a loser and you just give up. , but you still got all those things in your head that you keep putting yourself down. And then for many people, there's that justice piece that if I commit the crime, I got to do the time. I did something bad. I'm a bad person. I got to punish myself before I can let myself out of prison. And that there's that sense of justice that has to be served in their mind.

I'm curious about that too. I think because I know you have many , , there was shame we touched on, which I think was important. I know that there's a ton of stuff about guilt.

You could have had just simple trauma. That was just one thing or some instances. But you could have also had good parenting that was there to help you process it. Or somebody, even if it wasn't a parent, that could also be there as a fixture to help you process. Exactly. And I think bits of your personal story just filled in a lot of that for people. And I think to me, the big picture is everybody needs to learn not necessarily all the trauma stuff. That's what a child is supposed to be learning as they're growing up. And even if you had pretty good parents, we all still could learn more about fine-tuning being healthy. And that's really what I try to do a lot of is, yes, define the trauma in great detail and the ramifications, but really to define what does healthy look. And if you never thought about this, to maybe say, oh, some of that. That could be something I should look at more. I heard something that made me think or feel something. That is good clues.",

    "output": "Tanya Cushman Reviewer. I first became aware of the scapegoat story when I was about eight years old and I heard it in Sunday school. I thought it was a fun story. The priest picked out a goat and the goat was to carry the sins of the herd, of the family, and then it was sent off into the wilderness. And the family was forgiven of their sins, but the goat was gone carrying all the responsibility. If there was someone in the family who had killed someone, the goat was the murderer. If there was someone in the family who lied, the goat was the murderer. The goat was the liar. And now the goat was shunned alone and out in the wilderness. And I would imagine if someone saw the goat, they would see all the sins on it and they wouldn't be able to see who the goat had been underneath. And I always wondered, what was it about that goat that got it selected. Because the priest had to look out and see. And I would look at all the other goats and say, that one. And there was something decidedly different. It's always something, but you can't say exactly what it is. And over the years, I've heard about scapegoats and, let's say, politics and all sorts of underhanded things and people get blamed, but that's all I knew was that. And eventually, I did learn more about scapegoats and different things that and the black sheep of the family. And I started to feel strange things while I was in my family. I said, something is not. And I started attending, seeing a therapist. And over the years, I realized that I was a scapegoat. And that explained. A lot. It explained a lot. Rebecca Mansville, who wrote Ridicule, Shamed, and Blamed, said that it is a dysfunctional family that needs a scapegoat. And the scapegoat is the tip of the iceberg, indicating that something deeper is wrong underneath. And dysfunction comes from the fact that, , that there's a lot of things that are wrong. It comes in many forms, but I'll be talking about the narcissistic dysfunctional family, which is a very dangerous and complicated system. And the dysfunction involves dark and dangerous secrets, pitting one person against the other, and not accepting responsibilities for your actions.",

    "output": "Tanya Cushman Reviewer's Name When I was 28 years old, I felt called to Los Angeles to be near my father, who had been living there the majority of my life. I asked him to come to Atlanta we could take a road trip. We packed up my 2003 Honda Civic, including my favorite stuffed animal, Honey Bear, and started driving. Pops had this idea to make the trip educational. First stop, the Civil Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama. From Montgomery, we went to the George Washington Carver Museum at Tuskegee University. There, we rediscovered Pops' love for the multiple uses of the peanut, starting. starting with eating them all the time. Next stop, Pensacola, Florida, because wherever we are, there must be water, and the Gulf of Mexico was calling our name. We drove and laughed and cried. We exchanged our biggest ideas for the future, all witnessed by little brother Honey Bear in the backseat. Somewhere driving the never-ending road through Texas, and while jamming to the dance floor mix of less groove tonight, I must have entered a trance. And a southeast DC oracle, I told my daughter, you've reclaimed your life, Ardenique, now live your life. It's your time to a-victorize the situation. That's what I wanted. That's what I wanted. That's what I wanted. situation. At first though she said, Pops, you do know Victorize is not a word,. , but then the poetry sunk in and we both realized it means squeezing victory out of a negative situation, creating your own path, living your life in power on your own terms. Victorize. , that was just my pops to help me reframe a terrible experience I had. When I was 14 years old, my stepfather violated my innocence with sexual touching and at 16 years old he raped me and clouded the violation under some sick predatory guise of preparation for my teenage sexual years. He continued the sexual thievery until I turned 22. But I'm happy to say that my real father, this dude here, became an integral part of my healing. Instead of shutting down and turning away from each other, we chose to turn towards each other. We chose to be. We started what I now call my journey of reclamation. I started by telling my family about my stepfather. Understandably, they were upset, yet I immediately directed them not to retaliate.",

    "output": "I took deep breaths and I took direction from her. Starting by devoting myself to working with Adonike, along with her mother and the legal system, to convict this man and send him to jail. Thank you. Unfortunately, my experience is not unusual. According to RAINN, the Rape, Abuse, Incest National Network, one in nine girls under the age of 18 will experience sexual assault or abuse at the hands of an adult. Of the cases that get reported to the police, 93 of adolescents know their perpetrator, and 34 of perpetrators are family members. These numbers don't even include the victims whose cases are past the statute of limitations. Overall, only 310 out of every 1,000 sexual assault is reported to the police. I understand why many victims don't come forward. Filing a police report requires giving a statement in as much detail as possible. I had to remember and describe every time my stepfather violated me. The probing questions, the memories that resurface, and the re-traumatization are enough to keep any victim from coming forward. And I actually had a compassionate police officer interviewing me. And the effects of child sexual abuse and assault can be long-lasting. Victims of child sexual abuse and assault are four times more likely to experience PTSD as an adult, three times more likely to experience a major depressive episode as an adult, and often face increased struggles with self-esteem and personal flashbacks. I relate to those statistics firsthand. I've often struggled with depression and feelings of unworthiness. And dating was difficult. I would often run into men who would ask me, when will you be able to get over your abuse. When will you be able to just forget about it. Let it go. Some men wouldn't even continue talking to me after I explained my past to them. But what they fail to understand is healing cannot be rushed. Everyone heals differently. Besides my personal experience with abuse, I've actually got 20 years as a professional educator, scholar, and personal coach. And I can tell you the one common thread to healing is you must acknowledge the pain. When you ignore pain, it will come back and show its ugly face and drag you back down to the original symptoms of the trauma. Oftentimes this happens without warning and at the most inopportune moments. You must move through your trauma.",

And at the same time, I also searched for ways to take charge of my own healing. And there's no question, I needed healing too. I dove deeply into my lifelong love and engagement with literature, creativity, art, and music. I wrote poems. I embraced the freedom of jazz. I danced to my old temptations and earth-winning fire records. I attended art galleries as dancing and music concerts. I even channeled my imagination into the creation of an entire project about happiness and joy. I asked myself, what is a happy black man. What makes this black man happy. How can you ever be happy after your own beloved daughter was raped by another black man. A man who had shaken my hand. A man who promised to be my coach. A man who promised to be my co-parent. A man who told me to my face he was not my rival. I was lucky I could turn to a whole other group of black men as a healing, critical healing step. My amazing friends. I've known many of these dudes since my 20s. And they often stayed up with me late into the night. They listened as I poured out my agony. They helped me maintain my sanity as I just straight admitted my sense of failure. They loved me up as I expressed doubts about my manhood. But they all said to a man that the only hero's walk was to walk with Adonike. Adonike. Adonike. Adonike. For as long as it took. As one of the first steps of my healing journey in order to deepen our relationship, I wrote my father a long letter. I wanted to hear family stories that had never been told. I asked him anything and everything I could think of. When I got that letter, I decided to just sit down and record my answers. in one session on two 90-minute cassette tapes.

    "output": "I promised Adonike that I had the courage to be her father, to be her daddy, to be her pops. When I received his cassette tapes, I sat in my room with my headphones on, listening closely to his answers. Hearing his voice became the first brick to the foundation of the relationship that we have now. His voice gave me the courage to begin the toughest part of my healing, counseling. And with my therapist's help, I continued to build the relationship with my father that I truly needed and desired. I invited him to hear the truth about what happened to me. I asked for his ears, his heart, and his love, and my pops accepted. With Adonike's therapy, I became a therapist as witness. I asked my baby girl exactly what happened. It was the hardest question I've ever asked. But I needed to face the whole truth about what she had endured. The honesty on those cassette tapes, the honesty in that counseling session, became the bedrock of my work with my kid from then until now. During this unwanted crisis, embracing a loving conversation with my adult daughter became the, set the standard actually, set the standard for our future communications. We established the trust we needed to continue to heal and stay inspired. We dug into our wounds and searched for our healing. What do you need to begin to build your healing foundation. Therapy. Non-abusive allies. Whatever you choose, it will require that you dig in. It hurts. It's tough. And it is a consistent lifestyle change, but it is worth it. My pops and I found our own rhythm to healing, our own beat and cadence, turning towards one another and not away. But Chaka Khan sang, you've got to be willing to go through the fire, to the limit and to the wall. You best believe it. I knew I had to earn any loving lessons I could gain from this ugly, ugly experience. I just literally imagined myself courageously collaborating with Arunique. I trusted my vision, that I could fully participate with her to break any circuits of silence between us, within our family, within myself. I opened myself to discussing any topic that I could ask and answer, but no, I was sure that it was a question.",

    "output": "and all difficult subjects no matter how uncomfortable such discussions made me. For me it was a no-brainer choosing my pops as my non-abusive loved one as my ride-and-live partner. When you make the decision to heal, to change, and to confront your trauma, choose your conversation partner wisely. And remember, they do not need to be biological family. Your ally can be a friend or a coworker. Choose someone who can help you imagine a healthy future. Someone who can help you chart a road to a better future. Choose someone who doesn't automatically give you answers or solutions. Someone who asks what you need but won't let you wallow in your pain, anger, and frustration. I'm glad that Arunike and I learned from this unwanted trauma that we are both fighters. That there was no way, no way we were going to live Let her criminal ex-stepfather win period pure and simple. Our bond grew from father-daughter to pops and ade. By choosing to be , we became friends. We felt this magnificent renewal stirring within us. We even learned to laugh. We discovered that we could be silly together. When folks see us in public or on social media, nobody would ever know that the tragedy of sexual assault had stalked our lives. I knew when we took that road trip that I was at a point in my life where I needed more from my father. I didn't have the words to explain it, but I had an instinct that our road trip would become a vital part of my healing. And it was. I reclaimed my voice and I reclaimed my father. We've earned this relationship. Our living legacy is finding and using our own voices. And for me, that definitely means lifting our voices and singing together. It also means saying in my most personal voice, Yes, sweetheart, I do want to be. You are not defined by the worst that you've experienced. My father reset the masculine standard of connection and communication in my life. Our connection has become the foundation of what I now yearn for in a partner. If I'm going to look at the rest of my life as a road trip, I know I don't have to take it alone. And I will choose to be no matter my destination. Thank you. Thank you.",

    "output": "Hey guys, I'm Heidi Preeb. Welcome back to my channel. Today I am making a video that is very niche. I'm curious about who has found their way here and what your experiences have been. Because I imagine if you resonate with this title or have a even passing curiosity about this title, we have a lot of stuff to talk about. I will get into my motivation for making this video, as some caveats about how I want to approach this topic. Those of you who have been following my channel for a while know that part of what has been helping me on my own attachment and CPTSD healing journey has been practicing a philosophy called radical honesty. Radical honesty is in some ways exactly what it sounds , in some ways not at all, but essentially a lot of what it is learning to notice when we're being dishonest, both with ourselves and other people. Learning skills for communicating more honestly in the moment. One of the kind of core philosophies that's at the root of radical honesty is that the majority of the suffering we do in life is created by lying. when we are dishonest with ourselves and or other people, we are creating a whole bunch of roadblocks for ourselves and a whole bunch of ways in which we are holding ourselves back, creating tension internally and externally, and overall just not allowing ourselves to experience the full breadth of what is available to us. I'm going to start with the first one, which is the most important one. The most important thing about radical honesty is that I am able to feel the truth and the truth that is available to us on this planet Earth while we are here. part of what's been really interesting for me as I go through the journey of practicing radical honesty and integrating it in some ways into my real life outside of workshops and radical honesty events, and in other cases, not at all integrating it into certain situations, is that I'm noticing why I lie. I'm noticing which situations come up where it truly is slightly more important to me. And that's what I'm trying to do. I'm going to start with the first one, which is the most important thing about radical honesty.",

And that's what I'm trying to do. To tell a lie than to tell the truth. And which situations it has historically been more adaptive for me to either lie or omit certain pieces of information, even from my own processing. And those of you who have watched a lot of my attachment related videos know that a lot of what attachment theory is looking at is what information do we naturally omit from processing. And secure attachment is all about having a healthy balance, of processing both emotional and intellectual information. But people who have complex PTSD, which is a lot of people with insecure attachment styles, particularly those with fearful styles, I imagine are a lot more likely to have traits of CPTSD. The same with people who have been through family scapegoating. if you have been following my family role series and you relate to the scapegoat, it is not unlikely that you ended up with CPTSD symptoms. And in this video, I'm not going to talk about the different types of CPTSD, but I'm going to talk about the different types of CPTSD that people have experienced. And I'm going to talk about the different types of CPTSD that people have experienced. And I'm not going to go into what complex PTSD is. The reason being is that would be an entire video in and of itself. But I do encourage you to check out the book Complex PTSD from Surviving to Thriving by Pete Walker. It is maybe my favorite psychology book I have ever read. And that is saying a lot. I read an average of two to three psych books a week. Complex PTSD does such an incredible job of looking at how early wounding impacts our adult functioning. And today I want to talk specifically about how early wounding, especially early wounding that leaves us with complex PTSD patterning, impacts our ability to be aware of and to tell the truth. And the reason I want to do this is not because I'm trying to shame anybody for being dishonest and not because I'm trying to moralize in any capacity about this,.",

    "output": "What I want to do is just give you some tools and some things to think about and be aware of if you identify as having complex PTSD symptoms, and you identify as someone who struggles to show up honestly and authentically in the world. I think that a lot of the reason why a lot of us who have complex PTSD symptoms really struggle with close connections, with maintaining intimate relationships, with feeling confident and we have high self-esteem is because it was highly adaptive for us on many levels when we were young to be dishonest or to omit information from our own awareness. then we developed a lot of these tools and we developed a lot of these tools to these patterns of not noticing the truth and not communicating the truth. And those patterns led to a lot of maladaptive and dysfunctional traits as adults that a lot of us aren't even all that consciously aware of,. this video is largely just me sharing some patterns of lying that I've become aware of in myself as I've gone through this process of trying to become more and more honest in the world and in my relationships. And if any of this is relatable to you, I'm hoping that you can use it as a means of understanding and communicating the truth. And I hope that you will find it helpful. And I hope that you will find it helpful. And I hope that you will find it helpful. And I hope that you will find it helpful. And I hope that you will find it helpful.

And I hope that you will find whether or not it might be safe to now tell the truth in some of these scenarios or to identify situations you can put yourself in where it's easier to be more authentic and more honest. again, this is not about shaming or blaming anyone who has CPTSD for lying, it is about championing you for the ways in which you have survived and adapted in the world and reminding you that maybe now there is a way forward that is even more adaptive, that feels a whole lot better and more intrinsically regulating and fulfilling. here we go.",

    "input": "I'm struggling with fear. Can you help me understand what's happening?",
    "output": "Without further ado, 10 reasons why people with complex PTSD might lie. Reason one, you are having a fawn response. This is probably, in my opinion, one of the biggest reasons why people lie without knowing they're lying. in Pete Walker's book, he walks you through what a fawn response is. It is part of what he calls the four Fs. when your sympathetic nervous system is activated because you perceive yourself to be in danger, we commonly think of going into either fight or flight mode. He argues we go into either fight, flight, freeze, or fawn responses. And when we are fawning, what we are doing is essentially doing some version of what you might otherwise think of as people pleasing. temporarily shutting down your body and your mind to your own desires and needs and focusing on giving the person in front of you what they want because your body is in fear and your body assumes that if you can give the person what they want, then they will not harm you. Now, the fawn response is a very common one. The fawn response is a very complex psychological phenomenon that I'm actually going to film a whole other video unpacking. when that video comes out, I will link it in the description of this video. But essentially what you need to know about the fawn response is that when you are doing this, when you are going along with what someone else wants, when you are people pleasing, when you are deciding that the easiest way forward is to go with the flow and be easygoing, often you are not overtly lying in the way that we tend to think about people. You are not sitting there with this burning personal desire that you're refusing to disclose. What you're actually doing is thinking, , I have a list of 10 things at any given point in time that I want. And now, the thing on the top of the list is harmony because I feel threatened. And even that is often not the most conscious thought process. What you might be feeling in that moment is I don't really have a preference. What you might be feeling in that moment is I don't have a preference. I don't have a preference. I don't have a preference. I don't have a preference.",

    "input": "I'm struggling with dysfunction. Can you help me understand what's happening?",
    "output": "Another area where people with complex PTSD tend to start lying very young, in my opinion, this is a pattern of lying that will start as soon as they go to sleep. if you have a pattern of lying that will start as soon as they go to sleep, or are in other situations, whether it's group sports or any type of social interaction where they're interacting with children from different backgrounds, people with complex PTSD lie to seem normal. there is a book called adult children of alcoholics. And it is this kind of movement spurred in the eighties where they started noticing these patterns and traits that were consistent for children who'd grown up with alcoholic parents. And then they started realizing actually, any kind of alcoholism is a pattern of lying. And I think that's a really good way to start to think about this. I think that's a really good way to start to think about this. Any sort of family dysfunction can lead a child to have these traits. And one of the traits is you are constantly guessing at what normal is. And I think that this applies to a lot of people with complex PTSD because their home environments, their early environments were not necessarily normal, or some of the situations they'd been through in life were not normal, or the way that they thought about themselves was an internalized belief that they are not normal,. I think it's very, very common, if not more common, to have these traits. And I think that's a really important way to start to think about a defining trait of having complex PTSD, to think of yourself as not normal, and to think of yourself as othered or outcasted or unacceptable, unlovable in some way, which is not true at all, by the way. But if you have complex PTSD, you probably think that. I think from the time that people with complex PTSD are young children, they have learned to lie to socially blend in. We all need social interaction. We need it. And to be fair, I think that's a really important trait. And I think that's a really important trait. And I think that's a really fair everybody does this to an extent.",

    "output": "You do not have to have an extensive history of trauma to want to blend in and to sometimes fudge the truth to do that. But I think that this is a particularly prevalent and obvious one for those who do have complex PTSD is because you don't really know what normal is, but you have the sense that you'll get outcasted if you don't fit the normal mold. You end up having to tell more lies than the average person who is closer to that normal mold than you are because they've had more, common experiences in order to get the same social acceptance,. this is actually highly adaptive for a lot of kids. And it's not something that I think anyone would blame or shame a child for. But it is something that as we grow up, we learn to blame and shame ourselves for rather than accepting. , the reason why I don't always act my true self, the reason I don't always connect really deeply with people is because I learned from a young age that to get social acceptance, you have to lie about who you are and lie about what you've been through,. this is once again, not about shaming or blaming you for this, it's actually about giving yourself some self compassion around it,. You fought to survive and part of fighting for survival means fighting for social inclusion. And that's what you've been doing for a lot of your life if you have complex PTSD. Chances are it led to some small or humongous lies along the way. Now number three is a very important one. And it's a very important one. And it's a very important one. Because this is not just about lying to other people. This is about a really deep self lie. And this is that from the time they're very young, many people with complex PTSD, because they have this fragmented and disoriented sense of who they are, because their true self was not mirrored back properly to them through their caregivers much of the time, you actually might have a story about who you are that is not at all true to who you actually are.",

    "output": "psyche and even you don't really know who you are or what your true identity is reason number four you might have learned to lie from a young age is you learn to lie to avoid loss when you are a child the biggest possible threat to a child is getting taken away or separated from their caregiver it does not matter for 99 of children if their caregivers are abusive if they're unable to take care of them if they are neglectful there is something primal that attaches us to our caregivers because from the time we are young we learn based on the fact that they keep us alive with their literal bodies if you are breastfeeding as an infant i will die if i'm separated from my caregiver that is what children believe on an instinctual level it often does not matter how dangerous or unfit their caregivers are the thought of being separated from them of being let's say put into foster care or being taken away from their caregivers is a very important factor in the process of making sure that they are safe and that they are protected and that they are protected from the threat of being abused or taken away by social services is threatening on a core basic survival level to most children when that sense of survival is strong the logical thing to do is to act everything is fine at home even if it's not to act if you are being abused even by someone outside of the family if you believe that there is some sort of threat to your connections with other people with your family with the people you think are protecting you if you are to disclose what's actually happening you're probably going to lie about it that's a really strong incentive to lie when you are a child and i think what's important to note here is that idea that you have to lie to avoid loss becomes encoded in the body you might now make an unconscious association between keeping people's secrets and keeping them in your life when you meet someone who let's say abuses you as an adult physically or psychologically or sexually or whatever it is you might feel compelled to lie about it and that's a really strong incentive to help you keep that secret because you have this response in your mind that's telling the truth means dealing with incalculable loss you are naturally incentivized inside of your own mind by your own conditioning to keep people's deep dark secrets and you start lying on behalf of other people another adult child trait is being loyal to a fault and i think that this is kind of all wrapped up in that we believe that telling the truth leads to loss lie to keep other people's secrets and we lie really in those cases most of the time now far we've talked mostly about the lies that you will turn to in childhood if you have complex ptsd but i want to talk about how these tendencies and these patterns of lying mature and develop over the course of your life and express themselves in adulthood the adult version of lying for social inclusion is lying to secure resources lying to get a certain job or to get money or to be able to sign a lease on an apartment when actually you have a really bad credit history by the time you have reached adulthood as a person with complex ptsd you probably have a couple of comorbid mental health issues you've been dealing with on and off for years you probably have patterns of unstable relationships that you've been struggling with because complex ptsd makes intimacy really difficult you might have struggled to hold down a steady job to keep your commitments in various areas because you're not going to be able to get a job because of all of these mental challenges and blocks that you have in the way of day-to-day functioning you might learn to lie to do whatever it takes for you to get money to secure a place to live get ahead in life whether this means making up elaborate stories about why you don't have a reference to give in the workplace whether it means faking a reference for an apartment whether it means forging documents or hiding the money you make or any long sequence of survival skills you have picked up over the course of your life to cover up for all of the other ways in which you struggle to do things in the linear way that other people who do not have a long trauma history seem to be able to easily do things this is again why we call complex trauma complex it has its tentacles in every area of your life for most people who struggle with complex trauma and by the time you are 20 30 40 years old you are probably already covering up for years and years and ever more effort on this and you wouldn't want to make progress but after a but through time important now i need and then i just want to let everything you're talking about going everything you previously talked about being better out of the cliff starting over time you don't you just you really feel berle wall super selves kind of approaching 100 percent and years of circumnavigating the rules and getting around certain barriers and having to find creative ways to keep yourself resourced and alive and thriving in this world.",

    "output": "Because chances are the linear pathways did not work for you, were not an option for you, because you had different needs than the people who were on those linear pathways. Even if the different needs was, let's say, you couldn't focus properly, you have a really poor attention span because you frequently dissociate as a trauma response,. That's going to make school a lot harder for you. And if school is a lot harder for you, getting a regular job might be a lot harder for you. And if getting a regular job is a lot harder for you, you might have to jump through a lot of hoops to do a lot of different things for work that might now make it difficult to sign a lease on an apartment because your landlord wants proof of employment, but you don't have stable employment. And if you need a co-signer in the event that you don't have stable employment, you might not have a co-signer because maybe you don't speak to your family, or maybe you can't hold down a serious relationship with someone who could co-sign. all of this turns into this web of scenarios where you are constantly triaging the next great emergency in your life. And again, I say this without judgment, I say it with the utmost compassion, because I understand. Life is not as easy for you as it's been for other people, chances are. And, chances are, you have learned to lie about your circumstances as a means of getting the resources you need to stay alive. And I applaud you for doing that. Nobody on this planet is more resourceful than a complex PTSD survivor. Nobody. Reason six you are likely to lie if you have complex PTSD as an adult is toxic shame. John Bradshaw, who's a brilliant psychologist, wrote a book called Healing the Shame That Binds You that talks all about this concept, of toxic shame. Pete Walker also goes over it extensively in his Complex PTSD book. But essentially, to have toxic shame means to have a shame-bound identity. to think of yourself as inherently shameful at the core. And when you think of yourself as inherently shameful at the core, you start telling a lot of lies to try to avoid other people seeing that core.",

Because the problem is when you internalize the identity of a person, you're not going to be able to understand how deep this goes. you start to think about yourself as inherently shameful at the core. And then you, let's say, fail at something or struggle with something. People who are not shame-bound would go, oh, I failed. Oh, I struggled at something. I must need to learn some new skills. I must just need some help. People with toxic shame do not think those things. They think I failed or I struggled because I am bad, pathetic, disgusting, unworthy at my core. And then it gets really hard to try again. And I think it's important to think about that. And I think it's important to think about it. And this is the lifelong process of self-gaslighting based on what other people told you when you were a child who did not know better. And this is, in my opinion, the biggest thing that holds people with complex PTSD back. And this is the thing that makes me angry every time I meet someone with complex PTSD and they talk about themselves this way. I want to go back in time and I want to shake whoever first told them those things about themselves. And I want to just overload them with the message that they are not shame-bound. And I want to shake whoever first told them that they are worthy of love and that they are worthy of trying and failing and that not meaning that there's something wrong with them, that they are deserving of help, that they are no different than anyone else out there who is trying and failing, who is needing help, deserving of support. The only difference is that they don't think they can ask for it. If you have complex PTSD, you think that whatever happens to you that is bad was in some convoluted way caused by the fact that there is something deeply wrong with you. And oh my God, you are wrong. That is not the case. It's not the case, but it's also ridiculous, truly ridiculous how wide-reaching this is.",

    "output": "I think one of the clearest examples for myself is that I have had chronic pain since I was about 16 years old, undiagnosed, likely psychosomatic, a trauma response slash stress response. And every time I am experiencing a chronic pain flare-up, I think that I'm faking it. And this is absolutely not the case. I think that I'm faking it. And I think that I'm faking it. And I think that I'm nonsensical because I am not faking these flare-ups. When I have a chronic pain flare-up, it is pain I have never experienced in any other situation in my life. I can't get out of bed. I can't stand up. And every time I get one of these flare-ups without fail, without fail, I start berating myself for being a little baby. And I start telling myself anyone else would just suck this up and get through it. No, they would not. Anyone else feeling that level of pain, I think would admit themselves to the hospital. But because of this conditioning, that there's something deeply shameful and wrong with me, it has taken me long to accept that when I'm in pain, I deserve medical attention. I deserve to have a doctor who knows about this. Any other person would have a doctor who knows about this and would run tests on them. But there is this belief when you have complex PTSD, that anything bad that's happening to you is just because you are being overdramatic or because you, should have known how to prevent it,. there is such a deep, deep seated sense of shame when you have complex PTSD, that it overtakes rationality. It literally overtakes your ability to understand which resources are available to you. You are quick to assume that you are just being irrational and that your thought process is wrong because you've been told that on some level for a very long time, that you will end up lying about things because you're gaslighting yourself. Toxic shame. Toxic shame makes you think that this secret, goopy inner badness inside of you that you just magically have is the cause of everything that goes wrong in life.

    "output": "And if you were to be forced to stop, now one of your coping mechanisms is gone,. And again, I am not advocating. I'm not advocating for drug use, for alcohol use, for unhealthy relationships or staying in abusive situations. All I am doing here is saying that people with complex PTSD often find themselves in situations where they are choosing the lesser of all evils,. Where none of the options available to them were particularly good. they are choosing the one that allows them to function the best they possibly can within the situation that they're in. And then they might lie to cover up some of the negative aspects of whatever it is that they have chosen, because they know that for other people, that thing would be a problem. Whereas for them, it is more a solution than it is a problem. And that's where you start getting the overt lies,. My partner is wonderful. Our relationship is great. I didn't make it to the event last night because I got tired and fell asleep. Not because I was in the middle of an altercation. Sober, I don't use, I don't drink, whatever it is. I'm sober, I don't use, I don't drink, whatever it is. All of these conscious lies that you learn to tell are often coverups for situations that other people will not understand or that they will judge you harshly for. And again, complex trauma is complex. There's not easy answers to any of these,. The best possible solution is if you're able to get help and you're able to, let's say, find a counselor who deals with complex trauma and who knows the ins and outs of it, that's likely to be someone who is understanding of why you're doing the things you're doing that other people might frown upon or might judge you for because they understand that you are fighting for your own survival and you always have been. Reason number eight why people with complex PTSD might lie. This is one that overlaps really neatly with anxious attachment, but it can be slightly different between complex PTSD and anxious attachment, or you can have both.",

When we have trauma, especially when we have trauma and we don't know we have trauma, especially, especially, when we have complex trauma and we don't know we have complex trauma, complex trauma involves something called emotional flashbacks. Emotional flashbacks are essentially to complex trauma what regular flashbacks are to, for example, emotional trauma. Acetyl is designed to carry mental automatically even greater emotional and it's used in positions play. where you are either bonded or closer to your world when you are in the asshole states. And, , it has a certain level of reality value and awareness. As I seen, those might not be applying still kind of seeing the room you're in, you're still aware of where you are, but your body kind of thinks it's in the past and starts emotionally responding as though you're in a traumatic past situation. this might look sudden outbursts of anger or dissociation where you're totally not present and other people can kind of tell you're not responding appropriately. This can look total shutdown and panic and withdrawal. And if you are experiencing an emotional flashback, you have to find a way to explain to other people why you are having a reaction that doesn't fit the situation, but often you don't even know why that's happening,. Very, very few complex PTSD survivors can point to the direct correlation between their emotional flashback and the weird reaction they're having in the present. Our bodies store a lot of responses and those responses aren't always tied one-to-one to specific past memories. It's more of an accumulation of feelings and fears and survival responses. But if you've just blown up at someone and now you have to explain why that happened, you're going to try to find a reason to explain why it happened.",

Maybe you got eight hours of sleep last night, but you are dissociating because you got triggered by something,. But you feel you can't disclose that. instead, you come up with another reason that kind of fits the reaction you're having. But that isn't the truth.

And the last thing I wanna make clear is that, before we get started, I am not a licensed psychologist this is not clinical advice. I do have a bachelor's degree in psychology and a master of science in attachment theory and research some of what I'm gonna say is informed from my background in attachment theory. However, all I am doing here is looking at patterns that exist within what I personally have read and observed in people I know who struggle with complex PTSD, toxic shame, and insecure attachment patterns. with anything, if there's something in this video that works for you, feel free to take it and leave whatever does not work for you. All , without further ado, to get us started off, I wanna lay out a formula of what tends to happen when someone who has a strong sense of toxic shame or complex PTSD encounters a life stressor. And I want to contrast it to what someone with a more secure sense of self or a secure attachment style is going to do in the same type of situation. And the reason I wanna provide that contrast is because I want to start normalizing some of the challenges that those of us with toxic shame face that we might be wrongly attributing to a failure of the self or something being broken, corrupt, or wrong with the self when in fact, we are just coming up across stressors that the average person experiences but might not end up in the same kind of downwards mental health spiral around them because they are able to properly attribute the cause of their stress. As opposed to over assuming responsibility for everything that is going wrong. without further ado, let's look at what happens when a secure person versus someone with toxic shame, attachment wounding, or CPTSD encounters a major life stressor. major life stressors happen to absolutely everybody. It does not matter what your upbringing was , what your attachment style is, life is inherently stressful. Challenges come up.",

    "output": "However, it's less likely because if you do not have a complex trauma history, you're more likely to have a more resourced life in every sense of the term. a secure person who doesn't have a way to make rent next month or who's going through a significant educational or relationship challenge is highly likely to recognize that they need both comfort and support in order to navigate through that challenge. what they're going to do is go, , I'm stressed. maybe I'm going to need to reach out to my social support network and lean a little bit more heavily on my friends, family, loved ones than I normally do as I'm navigating through this period of difficulty. But also I'm going to think about where I might be able to source help. if I'm struggling academically, which professors should I go talk to see what I should do. If I'm struggling financially, are there social services I can look at that might be able to help me figure out where I can get the resources I need if I'm in a pinch. If I'm struggling in my relationship, who might I be able to go talk to or is there a professional I could consult to kind of figure out what's going on and gain some additional context for myself or some additional skills for myself if that's what's needed to help me navigate through any of these specific challenges. And because there's this natural sense of interconnectedness in the secure worldview, it tends to be easier for them to go access the services they need as the social support that they need to get through that. I think that's a really good point to navigate through periods of stress more effectively. Now let's contrast this to someone who has complex PTSD, insecure attachment, or toxic shame or all of the above as it often happens. When you experience a life stressor as a member of one of those groups, what's highly likely to happen is that you're not going to recognize your own need for comfort and support. Particularly if you have complex PTSD, which is the result of early repetitive traumas that leave you with the feeling of hopelessness. there is a learned helplessness aspect to complex PTSD.",

As soon as a problem feels a certain level of big and overwhelming, there is no way out of the problem. I just assume I'm going to be stuck inside of this problem forever. What might not occur to you is that there are social resources that are available to you or that you might need some comfort and social support navigating through the challenge. The reason those things might not occur to you is because you may have internalized from a very young age, social systems are not here to help me. They're for normal people and I am not normal, which is a core belief of mine. I'm not a person who is in a position to have toxic shame, ergo there are not social support networks that I can reach out to for practical help and you may not even be cognizant of the fact that you have a need for comfort, period. Because most people with complex PTSD, toxic shame or severe attachment wounding did not receive comfort on a consistent basis in their childhood, you may never have learned that life stressors are easier to deal with if you have comfort. You may have internalized something along the lines of what helps you get through it. But what helps you get through difficult periods is sucking it up, pushing down your feelings and barreling through. However, your system still needs comfort. Even if you have consciously repressed the need for it, your system is going to naturally crave it when you are going through difficult periods. that leads us to what tends to happen next for people who consciously or unconsciously deny or repress the need for comfort and help when they're facing a life stressor. And what tends to happen next is that dysregulation and procrastination pop up. Now, if you have a very strong need for comfort, help and support, however, you're not even aware that you have it, which is very typical for those with toxic shame, where that feeling of vulnerability may have become a shame-bound emotion.",

I should have just dealt with this at the time it came up. And now look how big it is. And now look how many other problems I have in my life. And instead of correctly attributing the cause of those problems to the fact that you did not learn proper coping mechanisms for tackling and sourcing comfort and support around problems, you're going to attribute the fact that these problems worsen heavily towards yourself being a useless human being. And you might start telling yourself these stories , I'm lazy, I'm unmotivated. Anyone else would have been able to solve this as soon as it came up. I have to hide from other people how many problems I have because if they saw how many problems I have, they would see how worthless and lazy I am and how I can't do anything. toxic shame and the inner critic at this point might be incredibly online for you. And when we have toxic shame, what else comes online in the body. A need for comfort. now we are all the way back to the beginning. We have this need for comfort. We don't necessarily know how to get it. We don't feel we're worthy of comfort if we are in a place of toxic shame. And once again, the system gets dysregulated and the cycle starts over again. Now, I say all of this and I outline all of this not to be discouraging. I do not think that this is what you are fated to if you have toxic shame, CPTSD, whatever it is.",

And the first thing I want to acknowledge is that if you are watching this video and you have complex PTSD, I'm going to say there's a 99 chance that there has never been a point where everything is just going normal for you. You have no significant problems, challenges, or stressors. And then a singular stressor, pops out of the blue and this cycle begins. You have probably been locked in this cycle for as long as you can remember because to have complex PTSD often means you have extreme difficulty with forming close relationships, regulating your emotions, securing consistent resource. it's likely that you have been in this state of responding to abnormal stressors for as far back as you can consciously remember. And you don't necessarily have the option to just tackle this at step one a secure person would, and reach out to your support network of secure people who have resources they can lend you. That's likely not an option for you or not an easily available option. we have to look at what we can do at any point in this spiral to start moving it in the opposite direction. And what we're going to talk about now is the role that self-compassion and self-understanding can play in this process. I think that for most people with toxic shame, the term self-understanding might feel more accessible, but I will be using the term self-understanding and self-compassion interchangeably. the first place you want to be able to apply self-compassion or self-understanding is when you are faced with a significant stressor and you have a need for comfort. It's unlikely that you're going to recognize your need for comfort consciously if you have CPTSD. Because again, if from a young age you never got comfort around life challenges, or you internalize this belief that unless something overtly traumatic has happened to me, that absolutely anybody would be incapable of functioning in the face of it, I do not have a need or I do not deserve support, care, and compassion from other people.",

Now I want to drop it down one more level. Let's say you've already arrived at the place, and this is probably where most of us are starting from if you have a history of complex PTSD, where the problems have significantly worsened. And you have this sense of normal people do not let X, Y, or Z problem get this bad and toxic shame is kind of creeping into the corners of your worldview. Can you, in that moment, when thinking about that problem, take the time to think about the problem and think about the problem. Take the time to think about the problem and think about the problem. And when you do that, take the time to explain to yourself gently and in a non shaming way, why you are having that problem. What sequence of events led you to this point in your life where it's possible that you have such a problem that an intelligent, worthwhile person yourself has not yet found a way to solve. Is this because you don't know how to ask for the help or resource you need to solve this problem. Is it because you feel too much shame to access the help or resource that you need to solve this problem. Is it because you don't know how to regulate yourself enough to solve this problem. Is it because you developed a redemption fantasy as a child in order to survive a terrible childhood in which reality was not doing you any favors when it comes to staying sane and now you're having trouble letting go of that redemption fantasy. instead of dealing with these problems, you're dissociating into some sort of fantasy where they're all fixed. None of those things are inherently shameful. They're all normal responses to having had a hard time. They're all just things that you can't help but think about.

The world is full of those people. And it was not any of their faults that they developed those problems, and it's not yours. However, what you do with it is up to you. You get to choose the way that you internally represent the problems you have. You can choose to have a moment of compassion for them, and you can choose to have a moment of compassion for them in any given moment. The closer you're getting to being realistic about how to solve them. At the end of the day, the thing that is going to keep you the most stuck if you have toxic shame, is the belief that the reason you have larger than average problems is because you are broken and shameful and there's something wrong with you. That is not true of you. It is not true of anybody, and you are not the exception to that rule. Nobody chooses a life filled with complex, complex problems and an inability to regulate around them. Not a person on earth would choose that. You are not the exception. And the way to reverse engineer this entire downward spiral and get to a place where you're able to function at least in a given moment, a secure person, is to start treating yourself with self-understanding and compassion in the places where you have once only had toxic shame. And when that toxic shame arrives, and when it takes over the system, it can feel incredibly overwhelming. It can feel paralyzing. It can feel disorienting. It can feel impossible to cope with. However, there is a line I love that goes, feeling shame does not mean you are shameful. And in those instances where the toxic shame is present and it feels really intense, what I want to challenge you to do is, can you have that feeling in your body. Can you recognize it. Can you name it as shame. This is shame, shame, shame. I'm feeling shame. And then at some point in that process, can you draw your awareness to the fact that shame is a feeling.

Getting a realistic handle on what it's going to take to fix your problems, as what type of emotional support you're going to need in the process, allows you to start sourcing the actual solutions and actual support and actual help that you need to start solving the practical problems in your life. And the more the practical problems in your life start getting solved, the more regulated you become overall, because you start developing a safer and more secure life for yourself. And the safer and more secure and more -regulated your life is, the more relaxed and the less overwhelmed you're going to feel.

It is a long journey. I'm not going to pretend it's easy, but the good news is you don't have to do it perfectly. A secure life and a secure attachment system gets built through a series of moments in which for even one minute, you are able to show up with compassion in a place where you could once only show up with shame and self-hate. Over the course of a lifetime, those minutes of self-compassion and self-understanding add up to a life where eventually the balance starts tipping in the favor of self-love. And once the balance has tipped in that favor, you're going to find that upward spiral starts happening on its own.

I promise I do not get any sort of commission out of recommending this book. It is just such an invaluable resource that has helped me immensely on my own healing journey. And going through it again this summer has been a really interesting experience for me because it's about three or four years after I picked it up for the first time and in that time I've done intensive trauma attachment and shame healing work. And I'm noticing myself reflecting quite a bit on what I thought the healing process would look when I first read this book versus what I've actually gotten out of it. And the ways in which my life has tangibly changed since that summer that I picked it up for the first time. And I have kind of a sneaky reason for wanting to make this video which is that I think a lot of people who struggle with complex PTSD in the early stages struggle immensely with even identifying with the term. It's insidious because toxic shame and complex PTSD can give us this feeling of oh I'm just over-exaggerating. This is all in my head. I'm just whining about things. It wasn't that bad. I'm just trying to get over it. I'm just trying to get over it. I'm just trying to get over it. I'm just trying to get over it. I'm just trying to get over it. I'm just trying to get over it. It wasn't that bad. I wasn't locked in an attic for years at a time as a child. Ergo there's no way that I could possibly have trauma despite having all of these pervasive symptoms of trauma consistently rearing their heads and wreaking havoc on our lives.",

    "output": "And that's something that we're able to do in the recovery process. And that's something that we're able to do in the recovery process. thinking about what we need at this present moment has beened a tamaing andMI around the end of these procedures. In particular the terrified baby position, and as we seek out some personal comfort we need. I find how these start out somewhat converting calf under aware of but that needs our attention. This could be a current situation or it could be memories that a current situation brings up about a past trauma that we have left unprocessed and that now wants our time and attention. And learning to work with those things is a very long process but the important part is that in the healing process we learn as much as we can to stop shaming ourselves for experiencing emotional flashbacks and we can increasingly look at those periods as a call for our adult selves to step in and attend to whatever it is that our inner children are reacting to with the love and compassion that was perhaps not available to us when we encountered the same types of triggers or challenges in our early life. Fourth thing you can realistically expect from the healing process when it comes to complex PTSD and shame work is you increasingly develop the ability to stand up for yourself without being in a fight response. in his book Complex PTSD, Pete Walker talks about how it's important to be able to stand up for yourself in a way that is both firm but also respectful of others. And in my opinion there is exactly one key to assertiveness and that thing is the belief that you matter. If I know that I am a valuable worthwhile person who cares about both myself and other people it's actually pretty easy to learn where to set my boundaries and how to enforce them. But it is really hard to do that if I believe either that I'm a piece of garbage or that I will never be happy until everybody else attends to my needs for me.",

    "input": "I'm dealing with healing and feeling stuck. What perspective can you offer?",
    "output": "But in order to trust someone to be a good person for me to get really close to and to start co-regulating with they also need to be reasonably good at self-regulating the same way that I am now reasonably good at self-regulating. Otherwise our relationship is going to become a giant mess of projections that it's really difficult to resolve and that can be extremely emotionally and practically destructive. you learn discernment about who you are and who you are not. And I think that's really important because I think that's really important because I think that's the key to understanding who you are and who you are not. And I think that's the key to understanding who you are and who you are not. And that discernment allows all of our relationships to get better because we have realistic expectations for them. Sixth thing that might happen in the complex PTSD healing process is you're increasingly able to navigate through making mistakes without brutal self-shaming. At the advanced levels you can even have compassion for yourself as you move through mistakes because your inner parent can lovingly let your inner child know that it's a good thing to be trying in life and you're not going to be able to do it again. And that's when we start to realize that there is a lot of room for improvement. And trying means you are going to get a certain proportion of things wrong. If you were brutally shamed for mistakes when you were young it's highly likely that you internalize that same critical voice around making mistakes as an adult. But what a good enough parent does for their child is show up for them the hardest when they've made a mistake because they know that's when that child needs the most compassion, encouragement, support, and guidance. And you can train yourself to be that type of inner parent for yourself. And that's when you're going to be able to make the most of your life. I've talked about this in a different video but there's this song by the band Muna called Number One Fan where there's this lyric in it that goes, I've been looking at myself in the mirror saying don't leave me now, don't leave me now.",

    "output": "In what it means if, for example, one song wasn't that good enough and it didn't sound maybe not the best in the world for you to be able to of roehampton which is in london england and the professors at that school were intelligent and such genuinely critical thinkers but also they were deeply invested in the -being of children and just encountering and getting to learn from a group of people that was healing on a deep level for me it restored my faith in a large degree that there are highly competent adults out there who care about the same things i care about and are paying attention to the same things i'm paying attention to and every time i encounter someone that i feel a little part of my soul relaxes a little bit more into life and that is ideally a continuously unfolding process that you go through as you heal from relational trauma learning that you can use your discernment to figure out who it's safe to learn from and who might just not be the best mentor for you eighth thing you might realistically be able to expect out of the cptsd or toxic shame healing process is that you're increasingly able to take some risks in your life and i'm not talking about the kind of desperate reckless risks that you might take when you're driven from a place of toxic shame and you're trying to solve some problem or get some form of connection in a way that feels desperate and dire i'm talking about having a stable enough life which might take many years to build for yourself that you actually feel you can open yourself up to some genuine vulnerability knowing that you will be there to help yourself pick up the pieces if it doesn't work out you can actually let your inner child kind of come out to play more in your day-to-day life because you've set up a life where you are self-protective enough to know that you will recognize your own limits when you reach them and enforce your boundaries where you need to and as such once again you can take more risks and either fail more and learn from it or reap some pretty cool rewards ninth thing you can expect out of the cptsd healing process is that you slowly develop an awareness that your recovery is not going to look anybody else's i think that when i was in the thick of my shame i had this idea that healing was kind of having the ultimate hiding place i was always looking for ways in which i could hide away and disconnect from the person that i actually was and when i started doing counseling and recovery work i was this is great i can eventually get to a place where i can hide my true self deeply that nobody will ever know it was there and the biggest kind of surprise in my own healing process was recognizing that actual healing was the best way to heal and to heal the person i loved and to heal the person i loved and to heal the person i loved and to heal the person i loved and about reclaiming the person i actually am and no longer being ashamed to show that person to the world and to let myself form connections with other people based on my authentic self i think that if i could teleport back in time and tell myself five years ago that this was a possibility i wouldn't even bother because i would not have believed myself i would have been five years from now heidi whatever path you think you're on you are wrong get back here and hide every part of yourself if there's anything i'm sure of it's that your authentic self is not ever going to bring you love or connection in the world and this is one of those times where it just feels good to be wrong the more we heal the more we intuitively learn that not only can other people love us because of who we are not despite it we can also love ourselves in that way we can look back at the lives we've had and all of the maladapting coping mechanisms we use to get through that life and we can be grateful for every past version of ourselves what i now know is that healing is not just a matter of how much you love yourself but it's also a matter of how much you care about yourself and how much you love people and what you do and when you're most concerned about what you're doing and how you're treating yourself in the moment it is not ever going to make me look a person who was raised securely attached and has no history of developmental trauma but it is going to make me look the person i actually am which is a person who fought her entire life the best that she could and i can be genuinely proud of every past version of myself that in some way brought me here which leads us neatly into the 10th and last thing we're going to talk salvation fantasy and accepting that there is no state in which you are going to feel permanently good, happy, loved, accepted, and forever.",

    "output": "John Bradshaw who wrote the incredible book Healing the Shame That Binds You talks about how people who have shame bound identities tend to think of themselves as either less than human kind of broken flawed and no good or more than human. kind of pumping up our egos to compensate for what we lack in genuine self-love. when I catch myself feeling less than human and telling myself things I deserve poor treatment or other people are inherently worthier or better than me and deserve good treatment that I do not deserve I know that it's time to step into my dignity and to start tending to my own to exist and to be valued. But when I'm feeling more than human and I'm kind of resisting my own suffering I know that it's time to assume a position of humility and to step back and to think about what I'm doing wrong. I know that I'm not the best person I can be but I know that I'm the best person I can be and I know that I'm the best person I can be. And it's this strange kind of paradox that I find myself repeatedly arriving back at that sometimes when I'm struggling the most and when I'm doing the most kind of self-sabotaging behaviors what I actually need is more humility. I need to accept I'm not above struggling, I'm not above feeling sad, I'm not above being disappointed and I can be grateful for the opportunities that are afforded to me through every season of my life. The good ones and the bad ones. I'm going to step back and look at the bad ones because once again healing from complex PTSD, developmental trauma or toxic shame does not mean our lives feel wonderful forever. It just means that during the darker periods we are able to stay on our own teams because we finally believe that we are valuable human beings who are worth showing up and fighting for and that includes fighting for our own dignity personally and interpersonally. All these 10 things are far from the only things that we can do to be a better person. I'm going to step back and look at the bad ones and the good ones.

    "output": "Hey guys, I'm Heidi Priebe. Welcome back to my channel, or welcome if you're new here. This month on this channel, we're talking about self-esteem. And today in particular, we're talking about complex PTSD and some of the messages you may have internalized early on in life that made it really hard for you to develop proper self-esteem as you grew up. essentially, when we're looking at any form of trauma, what happens when the brain is traumatized is that it's not able to put your experiences into proper context. in the case of something single instance trauma, which is most often what we think of as PTSD, the brain ends up retaining either too much information about what may be relevant to that event. if something traumatic happened, and at the time it happened, you were looking at someone across the street wearing a red shirt, your brain might internalize red shirts mean danger. And then in the future, when you see a red shirt, you're born with a red shirt. And then in the future, when you see a red shirt, your body will be in danger. And then in the future, when you see a red shirt, your body will be in danger. And then in the future, when you see a red shirt, your body is going to respond with a trigger. Or you might retain not enough information about the traumatic event. if you go into a dissociative response, it's possible that you won't be forming memories properly around what led to that event, which could lead you to underestimating danger in similar situations in the future. essentially, when it comes to trauma, what we're looking at here is the fact that trauma disrupts our ability to process memories properly, and to put our memories into proper context. And in the case of complex PTSD, which is what we call a series of traumatic events that happen to us, usually early on in life, at a time when our brains were still developing, we have entire systems of meaning we form around incomplete forms of processing. when we grow up with CPTSD, often we grow up with a series of mental health challenges, neuroses, difficulties in certain areas of our lives.",

    "input": "How does shame impact a person's life, and what are the steps to healing?",
    "output": "And because we don't have the ability to make sense of why we're struggling with all of those things, and because we don't see them as what they are, which is trauma responses, we develop a sense of toxic shame, which is this idea that something I don't understand is wrong with me, ergo everything bad that happens to me in life is my fault, and there's nothing I can do about it. Because if I'm being honest, I don't really understand. And when we grow up with CPTSD, we develop a sense of toxic shame, which is understand why I am just different and bad and flawed relative to everybody else. And what I want to go over today is what it would have been had you had someone who I almost want to encourage you to think of as a spirit guide, guiding you through your early life and helping you understand and make sense of why you were developing in a way that was not necessarily similar or identical to the people around you, and how you could learn to understand and lend yourself compassion in those areas, instead of ascribing all of them to the fact that there is something wrong with you. And the reason I want to encourage you to think of this as more of a spirit guide than a parent figure is A because your parent figures may have been the source of your trauma if you have complex PTSD, but also B because it's highly likely that even if your parents were incredibly loving and doing their absolute best, they did not have the language and context themselves to help you make sense of your experience. I want to encourage you to think of this as a spirit guide, guiding you through your early life and making sense of those areas, and how you can learn to understand and make sense of what you're going through. And I want to encourage you to think of this as a spirit guide, guiding you to think of your parents and make sense of what you're going through.

    "input": "I've been dealing with triggers and I don't know how to heal from it. What should I know?",
    "output": "The reason why we get smarter when we heal our trauma is because our brain is actually able to context which situation we are in, it's not chronically responding to small triggers anymore, and we're able to take the appropriate cues from our environment that tell us I'm safe, I'm , ergo it's safe for the blood to flow to the areas of my brain that are more important for deep focus than they are for self-protection. if you had something a spirit guide or a really wise elder who was with you in your life, then you would be able to take the appropriate cues from our environment and see your childhood, something I feel pretty sure they would have told you is that the fact that you have much trouble focusing is not because there's something wrong with you. It's because you're emotionally dysregulated most of the time. And the most secure person in the world, faced with that degree of emotional dysregulation, without a reprieve from it or a way to understand it and how to work with it, would also have every bit as much trouble concentrating as you do. And this is something that as we do trauma work, we can start to heal from. But the first step in that process of healing from it is simply acknowledging that there is a reason it's happening and it's not a moral failing. Third thing you may not have internalized if you have complex PTSD, but that it's incredibly important to understand is that people need the most help, care, empathy, and support when they are struggling the most. when we have toxic shame, there's a very quick calculation our brain tends to do when we mess something up, make a mistake, or get something wrong. And it goes, now is the time to double down on self-criticism. The reason the brain thinks it's time to double down on self-criticism after you have made a mistake is because you probably had a very high cost of mistake early on in life. getting something wrong led to very severe consequences. And when that's the learning model that the brain develops around, it's a very important step in helping us get through this process of getting things. And if you don't get things , you're not going to get the results you want.",

    "output": "Maybe I'm at a new job and my supervisor is explaining the rules to me and they might actually be expecting me to stop them and ask questions around what I don't understand. But if I have this deep internalized shame that I should just already know everything regardless of whether or not I've been taught it. I'm probably not going to stop and ask questions as they come up. I'm just going to notice what I don't understand and then go into a shame spiral about it. Because that's what my brain naturally learned to do. Again to avoid making the potential mistake of asking for clarification on something. And then let's say months later our supervisor realizes that we did not in fact understand everything they were saying. They might be really confused and go I don't understand why you didn't just stop and ask me questions about what you didn't know. You might even be a person with complex PTSD. The idea that you don't know something because you're used to having those experiences of skill and knowledge gaps is shame inducing that you might not even be stopping in your day-to-day life to sort out what do I not know because I was dissociated when learning it early on in life versus what do I not know because I actually have never been taught it full stop in a dissociated or associated state. And in either case, it's really beneficial to give ourselves compassion. But it's also important to note that sometimes we are assuming we ought to know things that there is no way we could possibly know. We cannot know anything we have not been taught. it's not inherently shameful to have a knowledge gap. And it's also not shameful to have knowledge gaps around things we were dissociated when learning. But this is an awareness you likely have to wade into very slowly as you heal from complex PTSD and learn that you now exist within a world where it's safer than it once was to not know. Fifth lesson you may not have learned growing up if you grew up with complex PTSD is that in order for your life to feel meaningful, you have to get to know yourself and figure out what your unique wants, interests, and passions are.

    "input": "What should someone know about emotional dysregulation and how it affects their relationships and healing?",
    "output": "probably because there was a lot of shame in the way of you truly getting to know yourself growing up and you weren't able to make decisions from a meaningful place and I do have a video on emotional neglect that I've linked in the description of this video that's going to go over some signs that this might be the thing you're struggling with as how to start getting back in touch with yourself but the idea here is that one of the things you might be missing major context on if you grew up with complex PTSD is yourself and who you are and what matters to you and all of those things are what goes into building a life that feels meaningful sixth thing you may not have learned if you grew up with complex PTSD is that your triggers are not your core authentic self when I think of someone with toxic shame or complex PTSD I kind of think of the self-concept as three layered on the top layer there is the mask or the fake self that you learn to present to the world in order to get by in life and underneath that mask there's this layer of trauma triggers things your neurotic or obsessive patterns of thinking and behaving or your emotional dysregulation or your challenges with forming and maintaining healthy intimate relationships and you might think if you have complex PTSD that second layer is your core authentic self when you hear other people say you're not healthy you're not healthy you're not healthy you're not healthy you're not healthy you're not healthy you're not healthy you're not healthy you're not healthy you're not healthy you're not healthy just be yourself just let other people get to know you think no you don't understand my core authentic self is a bad broken person if other people got to know that person they would hate me but in reality there's a layer that exists beneath that layer and what exists beneath that layer is the raw core of you the part of you that just feels things very clearly and cleanly and directly the you who is able to think and sense make around those things in a clear way and often that version of you is the version of you that you spend the least time with because layer two involves much shame for you and tells you the story that whatever is beneath here is definitely going to be completely wrong and once again I have a video that goes over this in more detail called toxic shame how it leads to chronic dysregulation it is linked in the description of this one but the idea is that you mistake your traumatic responses for your core self those things are not the same thing and the beautiful thing about this is that the more we gain an awareness of who our true selves are and of the fact that there is absolutely nothing wrong with us in our raw authentic state that place becomes the solid ground that we can start standing on in order to gain the strength and perspective to start working with our trauma triggers and our neuroses and our toxic shame all of which are a very long process but again that process begins with recognizing that there's a difference between you your core cell or your soul if that's an easier thing for you to think of it as and you your dysregulated traumatized triggered cell one is a series of responses that you developed as a normal reaction to the circumstances you were in and the other is your utterly lovable humanity and that's the thing that we start to uncover and interact with more and more as we move through the healing process seventh thing it may have been helpful for you to know growing up with complex PTSD is that a lot of time when you are procrastinating what you are actually doing is spending the appropriate amount of time responding to really intense and overwhelming feelings if we are living with this chronic toxic shame our brains are going to be spending a lot of time desperately trying to get us out of that shame state and trying to get us to find anything in our environment or in ourselves that makes us feel and it is a good thing for us to want to keep getting up in the mornings and trying again and if you have a high number of things in your life that trigger you into a toxic shame spiral which is highly likely if you have complex PTSD essentially anytime one of those triggers goes off you are no longer in relationship with the thing you were doing that triggered that thing you are now in relationship with your own trauma response and that is a very time consuming thing to be in relationship with as an example of this let's say you have a lot of anxiety around doing your taxes or getting some other thing done that the average secure person maybe doesn't doing but doesn't have a trigger around and maybe the reason why it feels challenging for you is because every time you think of doing your taxes you have an image conjured up in your brain of an authority figure who there is going to be a humongous repercussion for you around if you get one thing wrong and now you're trying to do this task that is complex but not impossible but your brain is responding to it as though you are in extreme danger your fight or flight response comes online and now you can't focus and now because you can't focus you might go into that toxic shame response of why can't I do even the simplest task and as soon as toxic shame is activated now your entire system is going to regulate you out of that state of shame and now what you're dealing with is multiple simultaneous triggers and this is much different than trying to do your taxes in a regulated state but that might be the only thing that you are conscious of yourself doing because you're not used to tending to your inner emotional world as something that is real if you think I have this whole day to do my taxes and I'm not doing them you might come up with stories I'm just a little care about myself when in reality what's actually happening for you if you have those triggers online when you sit down to do your taxes is you are now managing a humongous amount of trigger and shame and those things are deeply time consuming any secure person who is hit with a trigger and a shame response as large as the ones that you may frequently experience would also need hours upon hours upon hours to try to regulate themselves around that and this is a framing I actually tend to find really helpful when it comes to those small tasks that feel triggering instead of saying I spent eight hours trying to fill out one form today I can tell myself I spent eight hours managing my toxic shame today and one or maybe zero hours filling out the form but I did not spend eight hours trying to fill out the form that is not accurate I spent my time and energy responding to a trigger that came up if you live with chronic have less hours in the day than the average person in the sense of you have less time in the day when you are regulated and therefore able to deal effectively with the tasks in front of you.",

    "output": "And again, I say this not to be discouraging because this is absolutely something that can and will change during the healing process. But I say it as a means of helping us context what we're dealing with properly that we're not shaming ourselves in areas where it doesn't make sense to do that. Eighth thing you may not have learned growing up with complex PTSD is that other people are chronically taking cues from you around how to interact with you. And sometimes what you think is senseless rejection is in fact a product of other people not knowing how to read you properly. growing up with toxic shame or complex PTSD means that you usually learn to inhibit quite a bit of your self-concept. But you may not be able to do that. You might not be conscious of the fact that you are doing that because you learned to do it young to hide certain emotions or certain inner states from the people around you that you might actually have no idea that you are not wearing your emotions on your face and your body to the same degree as other people. you might see other more secure leaning people walking around the world, interacting with each other and being quite naturally attuned to each other. You might see one person sitting down having a kind of rough day, looking at the sky and saying, I'm not sure what I'm doing. I'm not sure what I'm doing. I'm not sure what I'm doing. I'm not sure what I'm doing. I'm not sure what I'm doing. And then you might notice that on the days where you're feeling for Lauren or down, nobody comes to you and asks you what's wrong or offers to cheer you up with a joke. And you might start internalizing people just don't care about me. I am just not as worthy a person as other people or else people will say, I'm just not as worthy a person as other people or else people will say, that they're doing this to me. I'm just not as worthy a person as you. I'm just not as worthy a person as you.",

    "output": "And this is one we want to stay really aware of. Ninth thing you may not have learned if you have complex PTSD is that good people do bad things. And the degree to which we recover from those bad things and learn how to behave in a more pro-social way is often in direct proportion to how much love and guidance we receive. If when you were young, anytime you made a mistake or messed something up or hurt somebody, which everybody does, every person out there makes mistakes and hurts other people, sometimes really badly. When we have people and environments and communities that we trust who can help guide us through those mistakes and show us how to behave in a more pro-social, empathetic way without writing us off as people in the process of making mistakes, we can make mistakes. That is how we learn to exist in a healthy way in the world. And as adults, if we are not used to receiving any sort of guidance or support from our environments, when we make mistakes and when we hurt people, instead of looking around us for guidance and care and empathy and help in righting our wrongs, we learn to simply inhibit, berate ourselves and go back into those toxic shame beliefs of I am a bad person. And that is how we learn to be a good person who hurts other people. But a big thing that is important to internalize in the healing process is that mistakes will happen for the rest of your life. And as we start to heal from insecure attachment or complex PTSD or early trauma, one of the main things we learn is that if we are honest with ourselves and other people about why we made the mistakes we did and why we hurt people in the ways that we did, we slowly learn over time how to heal. How to behave in a way that respects both our pain and other people's pain in equal measure. And the healthier we get, the more we learn to surround ourselves with healthy others who can do that kind of work with us and who can hold us and support us through the mistakes we make. And we slowly learn that other people are the resources we need the most when we are messing up the most.",

    "output": "Relationships are not supposed to be the things that we pull ourselves back from and deprive ourselves of when we are struggling. They are the very resource that is going to help us out of that struggle if and when we don't have the answers we need for how to change on our own. And this is one that likely takes a long time to start correcting because we need to learn to trust in small increments and we need to learn to have good discernment about which people to surround ourselves with in small increments. And again, this often happens over a period of years. In the attachment and trauma healing process. But that process of being honest with others and receiving feedback and being loved and held through our mistakes is one that we need to navigate the rest of our lives in a secure way because we will not ever in any version of reality be able to design a life in the future where we never again make a mistake. The best we can do, any of us, complex PTSD or no complex PTSD, is design a life where we are held, cared about, and supported through our mistakes both internally and externally as much as is reasonable. Tenth thing, though really this list could stretch on into eternity, that you may not have internalized if you grew up with complex PTSD is that hope often comes about from a change in circumstances and that we can actually act our way into a better inner world. And this might sound very silly to you if you did not grow up with complex PTSD, but it's not. You might have no idea what I'm talking about. But essentially when you do grow up with complex PTSD, one of the core traits is that you have learned helplessness. Because when you were a child, you may have been truly powerless over the circumstances that you were in. You may have learned that there's no way to change your circumstances, ergo if you want to have a different feeling, other than the feelings of frustration, anger, hopelessness, whatever it is that are a product of your environment, you may have learned helplessness. And when you're in a different environment, you have to learn how to dissociate into a fantasy world where everything is perfect and nothing hurts.",

And sometimes in our adult lives, we're going to have to go after hope and optimism with a club and learn to proactively seek out environments and opportunities that will put more hope into our true reality. And when we have more hope and opportunity in our lives, our inner state begins to heal as an authentic response to what's going on around us, not as a product of dissociating from it. this is essentially the process of learning to strengthen the relationship between your inner world and the outer world, and how those two things interact with each other and can interact with each other in a way that is highly positive. But again, this takes some time to learn and deeply internalize. It's about slowly increasing our agency and our connecting abilities to the point where we learn that the world outside of our minds is actually our world.

The misunderstood soul. And you were the difficult one. The crazy one. The emotional one. The second you walk away and don't look back, that story crumbles. Because now people see you thriving, growing, breathing again. And they start to question what really happened. That drives the narcissist mad. Not because they care about truth. But because they care about image. what happens when a narcissist cannot destroy you. You rise. Not with vengeance. Not with bitterness. With peace. With self-respect. With clarity. You stop asking for validation from someone who is committed to misunderstanding you. You stop showing up to battles that only leave you drained. You realize you don't need to prove your side of the story anymore. You start living it. Out loud. Fully. Freely. And that freedom is the one thing they'll never understand. Because it's the one thing they can't take away once you've claimed it. When a narcissist starts to lose control over you, it's not just uncomfortable for them. It's terrifying. You were never just a person to them. You were supply. You were a reflection. You were the mirror that helped them avoid the truth. You were the one that helped them avoid the truth about themselves. When you begin pulling away, when you start saying no, when you stop reacting to their emotional hooks, their sense of identity begins to crack. You see, control isn't just about power to a narcissist. It's survival.

A cold shoulder. Little tests to see if you'll chase. And when you don't, that's when it escalates. They start making up stories. About you. About the situation. About how they're the victim.

Their charm no longer works. Their intimidation no longer scares you. Their silence no longer hurts. And they're stuck. Stuck with the realization that they can't rewrite who you are anymore. When a narcissist begins to lose control over you, it doesn't just bruise their ego. It destabilizes their entire identity. For most people, identity comes from within. It's shaped by values, integrity, relationships that are built on truth. But a narcissist doesn't operate that way. Their entire sense of self is constructed a house of cards, built on how others perceive them, how much control they can exert, how they can curate the image they want the world to see. when you stop responding to their manipulation, when you no longer play your assigned role in their script, that house of cards starts to fall. And they begin to implode. Not in a dramatic movie scene explosion, but in a slow, unraveling collapse that's both desperate and dangerous. At first, they'll try to tighten their grip. You'll see the tactics shift quickly. Gaslighting, love bombing, guilt tripping, anything that wants work to pull you back in. When none of it lands, they feel that internal panic rise. They won't show it, not at first. They'll pretend they're unaffected, maybe even act indifferent. But that indifference is just a mask, because beneath it is a storm of insecurity, rage, and confusion. They've spent long convincing themselves that they're superior, that they're always the one in control, that they always win. when you stop reacting, it confronts them with a truth they can't handle. They are not as powerful as they believed. That confrontation with powerlessness starts eating them from the inside. They begin obsessing over what went wrong, not because they want to learn, but because they want to find a new angle of attack. But nothing feels solid anymore.

Half-truths twisted into damaging lies. Character assassination disguised as concern. All of it is designed to restore their false sense of superiority. But even that begins to backfire. Because the energy they're spending to destroy your reputation only makes them look more unhinged to those watching closely. People start noticing inconsistencies in their stories.

It doesn't matter how many selfies they post looking unbothered. It doesn't matter how many new people they surround themselves with. Internally, they are consumed with one thing. The fact that you got away. That they couldn't break you. That you walked away intact. Maybe even stronger. That's unbearable to them. Because your survival is a threat to their illusion of power.

They can't handle being irrelevant to someone they once had wrapped around their finger. They start replaying the past. Reimagining conversations. Rewriting history in their minds to make themselves the victim. The implosion continues. Paranoia increases. Anxiety spikes. Self-hate. They've buried for years. Starts leaking out in the form of bitterness. Resentment. Sometimes even self-destruction. They isolate themselves not because they want solitude, but because they don't want to be seen while unraveling. When a narcissist fails to destroy you, something deeply uncomfortable happens for them. You become their mirror. And not the kind of mirror they're used to.

Someone who doesn't yet see through them. Someone who will reflect back the fantasy again. But it never lasts. Because once someone has shown them their true reflection, that image never fully fades. They can distract themselves, bury it, deny it, but the imprint remains. You've shown them what they lack. Not intentionally. Not with malice. Simply by refusing to shrink. Simply by staying grounded in your worth. Simply by choosing self-respect over chaos. When a narcissist realizes their usual tactics aren't working on you anymore, they don't retreat. They regroup. They don't stop trying to control They just change how they do it. That's the thing about narcissistic behavior. It's not static. It's adaptive. It's water looking for the weakest crack to flow through. And when one method fails, they switch gears fast. Often before you even realize what's happening. It's not about understanding you. It's about manipulating outcomes. If rage doesn't scare you anymore, they'll soften their tone. If guilt doesn't work, they'll try flattery. If playing the victim doesn't land, they'll come back pretending to be the hero. It's a performance. Each role designed to get back into your mind. The shifts can be jarring. One moment they're blaming you for everything. The next they're apologizing in a way that almost seems sincere. They may admit to being flawed. They may tell you're the only one who ever truly understood them. They'll say all the things they knew you once longed to hear. Things they withheld when you actually needed them. Because now, those words are weapons, not gifts. And the second you let your guard down, you'll feel it. The mask slips. The real motive shows. And you realize the apology wasn't about growth. It was about access. They'll test different angles a salesman switching pitches. If guilt doesn't land, maybe shame will. Maybe seduction will. And if all of that fails, silence becomes the new tool.

But in our research, we discovered that if you move your eyes back and forth, as you recall a traumatic experience, your brain is able to say, this is what happened to me in the past. And 78 of the people we studied who had adult-loss of trauma were completely cured. Can you do it on me. I could. What do you see. Bessel van der Kolk has been described as maybe the most influential psychiatrist of the 21st century. And for over 40 years, his clinical research has revolutionized how we understand trauma and its impact on our brain and body. Your early childhood experiences create who you are. And how many of the people that you treated in your practice have childhood trauma. About 90. And it's very difficult to change. Are they changeable. Yes, that is the great news.

I was the first person who studied yoga for PTSD, which was very effective. And then there's psychodrama and neurofeedback, where our results were stunning. People are conformist, we already know the answers, let's not explore anything new. But let's do the science and see how it works and for whom. And what about psychedelic therapy. It's very effective. Have you ever done a psychedelic drug. , of course. What did you learn. That my quest for understanding trauma had to do with my own childhood trauma. All the pain is suffering. Earlier on, I asked if people could heal from their trauma. Have you healed from yours. This has always blown my mind a little bit. 53 of you that listen to this show regularly haven't yet subscribed to this show. could I ask you for a favor before we start.

And we'll continue to do what we do. Thank you much. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, you've been described as maybe the most influential psychiatrist of the 21st century by the Financial Times. What is the mission you've spent your life pursuing. I have been interested in how people survive extreme situations. How people can overcome the history of people doing terrible things to each other. And how we can create a better world in that regard, actually. the mission has been rather social, but the investigation has been very much based on what we're learning about brain science, what we're learning about psychological functioning, etc. And this word trauma seems to be central to your work in writing. Yes. And when I looked before this conversation at the rise in the use of this word online and people searching this word, it's pretty staggering what I found. There's this graph that shows a huge jump in people using the word trauma. What is your view on the subject matter of trauma, specifically how we've misunderstood what it is. , there has been evolution, which is quite striking. And when I first started to study trauma, I was on the research floor at Harvard. And my colleagues said, why are you studying trauma. When you croak, nobody will ever talk about trauma again. , it's a completely alien subject. And now everybody talks. Everything is a trauma. And from being non-existent has become a total explanatory mode. And we have gone, as we always do, from one extreme to the other. And my primary interest these days is not much into trauma, trauma started it. But somewhere along the line, I got to realize that trauma is to a large degree a breakdown of connection between human beings and synchronicity between other human beings. And these days, I'm much more focused on how we can help people establish a relationship to themselves and to the people around them.",

But the small T trauma is a very real trauma when your environment around you doesn't acknowledge your existence. Most people, for example, after natural disasters do very because people get together after natural disasters. I've seen it where we have a cabin in Northern Vermont. We've had terrible floods. The neighbors get together. They help each other. And you get a sense of cohesion, actually. And a sense of meaning. We're doing this together. The small T traumas have to do with not acknowledging what's going on with you. Saying to kids, stop crying or I'll give you something to cry about. No, you don't matter. No, actually, your dad is a drunk because you are such a difficult kid that your father was doing until you came into this family and you were too much for him and you caused him to be the person that he is. I think people mean small T trauma. It's a relational trauma which is a very big deal for most of the people I get to see in my practice. Most people come in not because of big T traumas. It is because nobody saw me. Nobody heard me. I was irrelevant. I always had to take care of my mom or my dad. But there was no room for us. if you get fired from your job and it's a traumatic event for you because you get, I don't know, you lose your friends, you lose the job, your parents are embarrassed about you, can that become trauma, something that. Yes, you could, depending on how you define it. And for some people it doesn't, for some people it doesn't. It depends, again, on the context. For some people you get fired.

What did you do in those three sessions. Wiggle your fingers in front of people's eyes. I mean, for me, EMDR was really the gateway drug. Sorry, , I've written three books about PTSD. I actually wrote the very first book in which the word PTSD exists in 84 or something. But they didn't know how to treat it. I'm a world renowned expert but I have no idea how to treat it because people keep reliving that trauma and they don't know how to stop that.

You're telling me that wiggling your fingers in front of people's eyes can help heal their trauma. , then of course we had to do a little research which took us 15 years to get enough funding to do it, to see what happens when you move your eyes back and forth. And then we discovered that if you move your eyes back and forth, as you recall traumatic experiences, you activate certain pathways between the temporal-parietal junction, which is your sense of self. And then you move your eyes back and forth.

The reason that humans have survived is not because of your individual gifts or mine, it's because we can band together and build buildings and airplanes and all sorts of stuff. It's all communal things. it's not central in our science anymore today, but it's at the core of your life. And , as humans, we are a collective bunch of creatures who collectively create something. And knowing how to do that and how to adjust to each other is at the core of who we are. Are we losing that a little bit. , people are getting lonelier and lonelier and more individualistic. Huge, huge issue. Screens as virtual realities is our biggest challenge, I think. Why. Screens give you a virtual reality of pleasure, et cetera, et cetera, but it's not real and it's not a product of your efforts of doing something. You get a cheap reward, but ordinarily it takes a lot of activity. And you get your little dopamine rush and it feels you had the experience, but you don't learn how to get along with other people. You don't learn that visceral reaction of pleasure, of we are friends. What role does community and social connection play in trauma. Everything. Critical. And there's another thing that is troublesome about the development of our field, namely in our generation, trauma sort of started with experiences mine, working with combat veterans. I'm not a combat veteran. I was a conscientiously objected during the Vietnam War. I don't know anything about the US Marine Corps. And I couldn't have told people what it was , but I went in groups and I talked to each other and I learned about what it's to be a combat veteran from each other.

It seems that women are better at forming those connections than men. , I think. Although, no, that's not entirely true. , I think. I learned a lot about love from my combat veterans.

And they asked me about it. They asked me about it 50 years ago or something. And I said, I think it's a great idea because when you are traumatized, you live in a very constricted world.

In 2022, approximately 11 of children aged 3 to 17 had been diagnosed with ADHD, up from 9 roughly in 2016. And in the UK, between 2000 and 2018, ADHD diagnosis in adults rose 20-fold. What. With a 20-fold increase in medication prescriptions. And that's from the NHR. And in Australia, over the past decade, ADHD medication has surged nearly 300, with more than a 450 increase among adults and a significant rise among women. What is going on here. See, I really see that somewhat differently from the way you guys talked about it before. And that is, all these things are on a continuum. You don't You don't have PTSD or You don't have ADHD. You don't have ADHD. There are no binary issues. , this capacity to focus, to pay attention, to be flexible in your attention is a, is a dimensional issue.

Maybe you have it better than others. It's the other way around. some issues staying focused or staying still or paying attention. And that may be very many underlying issues. Maybe that your mom took some toxins while you were, she was pregnant with you. It's possible that it is in your genes. Just about every traumatized kids I've ever seen met criteria for ADHD because trauma really messes up your capacity to focus and concentrate. this is not an entity. It is a fictitious entity. It's not cancer of the gallbladder. It's not having astrocytoma in your brain. And these mental phenomena are networks of complicated ways of organizing your mind. And our diagnostic system just sucks. When I spoke to Gabor Mate, do Gabor Mate. , sure. , he was describing what ADHD was to me. And he said, he reviews it. He reviews it as a response to early childhood stress and trauma rather than purely genetic or neurological. , but I wouldn't say that. I'd say it could be genetic. It could be toxic. It could be trauma.",

But you wouldn't, you wouldn't think it because when you, if you met this person who did go through this abuse, much of their identity became formed around that abuse. even though they now live in an area where there's no abuse, they still find a perpetrator.

Is body language important. , let me address what you just asked. , number one, body language is supremely important because we are born without the capacity to talk, and we have to read the baby in front of us. To argue that body language, A, doesn't matter or it's subject to interpretation, B, doesn't matter, C, doesn't matter, D, doesn't matter, E, doesn't matter, E, doesn't matter, F, F, G, D, E, D, E, D, E, D. I would argue that would be a minuscule sentiment around the world amongst people who really have studied this, and I'll say why. a baby is born without the capacity to speak, but the mother quickly learns through non-verbals whether that child is colicky, whether or not that child needs just to be reassured whether they're cold or hot and forth. There's a lot of junk out there and that is probably the cleanest word that I can use about body language that this means that or whatever but we're exquisitely prepared to communicate at any time whether or not we're comfortable or uncomfortable, whether we're confident or not understanding. We had to evolve that precisely because we were always surrounded by predators.

    "output": "Hello and welcome to Being , I'm Forrest Hansen. If you're new to the podcast, thanks for joining us today, and if you've listened before, welcome back. If you've listened to the podcast for a while, you've probably heard one of our episodes on attachment theory, and we've done dedicated episodes on secure, anxious, and avoidant attachment. Today we're gonna be exploring the fourth attachment style, disorganized attachment, which is also sometimes known as fearful. This style is particularly complex. It combines elements of both anxious and avoidant, and because of this, it's really easy for people to feel they're damned if they do, they're damned if they don't. Closeness doesn't feel great, distance doesn't feel great, oh God, what do I do. And this can make working with this style particularly difficult for people, and it can feel particularly bad to feel kind of saddled with it. But hey, no worries, there are things that people can do, and to help us explore that, I am joined, as usual, by clinical psychologist, Dr. Rick Hansen. Dad, how are you doing today. I'm really good, and I just wanna say that I feel a lot of tenderness and support and respect for people grappling with attachment issues, particularly, in some ways, the most challenging of the three forms of insecure attachment, disorganized attachment. , this is hard stuff for people. This is some of the most difficult stuff that you can work with. It's also never a person's fault, definitionally. This is something that people, people get stuck with due to bad prior experiences, by and large. Nobody pops out, or I mean, if anybody does, it's an incredibly tiny percentage of people pop out with disorganized attachment. This is something that's developed. And I think that holding that kind of in your mind and in your heart as you're listening to this and working with this is really important. But before we get into it, I wanna give people a quick reminder. Rick does have a course that's going on now on healing insecure attachment. It's a five-week course focused on helping people work through attachment issues, and make changes in their relationships. And knowing that he was doing that course was one of the inspirations for this episode.

    "output": "I wanna start by giving just a very, very brief summary of attachment theory here. Again, if you're a longtime listener, you've probably already heard it, but hey, let's just all get on the same page to start at the top. The theory of attachment was originally developed by this guy, John Bowlby. He was a British psychoanalyst, and he was trying to understand why kids freaked out much when they were separated from their parents. There was a colleague of Bowlby's, Mary Ainsworth, who began to really study these infant-parent dynamics by looking at what happened when, I think it was 12-month-old, year-old infants were separated from their parents and then returned to them under laboratory conditions. This experiment was referred to as the strange situation, and it revealed that there was a lot of individual variation. It also revealed, very importantly, that this variation seemed to be based in large part on how the parent was with the child. And kids responded in three big categories of ways. About 60 were sad when the parent left, and then when the parent came back, they were happy. They calmed down quickly. They were , wow, I'm excited to see you. That's secure attachment. About 20 were fussy before separation and extremely distressed when they weren't. They were separated. That's anxious attachment. Then about 20 didn't seem particularly distressed when separated. And when the kid came back to the parent, they actually actively avoided them. That's avoidant attachment. Now, for me, the simplest way that I've come to understand this is what's called a four-quadrant model of attachment. Just two very simple questions. Does the person have a positive or negative view of themselves. Does the person have a positive or negative view of other people. There are two answers to each of those two questions. Which means, hey, four possible combinations. And those four combinations line up really nicely with the four different attachment styles. People who have a positive view of both, that's me, thankfully. Thank you, dad. Thank you, mom, are securely attached. People who have a positive view of others, but a negative view of themselves, I can't trust me, but I think that you can keep me safe, that's anxious attachment. But people who have a positive view of themselves, I can rely on myself, but maybe not such a positive view of others.",

That fourth quadrant, disorganized attachment, are people who don't trust others, are people who don't trust others, and also don't really trust themselves, particularly to keep themselves safe. particularly to keep themselves safe. This makes it that everything feels unreliable to them. dad, do you want to start by offering any commentary on what I've said far. And also, how do you just think about disorganized attachment. And also, how do you just think about disorganized attachment. And also, how do you just think about disorganized attachment. , a shout out to Kim Bartholomew and Leonard Horowitz, who developed that four category model that you alluded to. who developed that four category model that you alluded to. I actually had not been aware of it until prepping for this episode with you. prepping for this episode with you. As a bit of a detail, as myself, an avoidantly attached person in my childhood, as myself, an avoidantly attached person in my childhood, I also had many, many deep feelings of insecurity, I also had many, many deep feelings of insecurity, low self-worth, feeling unwanted, low self-worth, feeling unwanted, even if there was in myself even if there was in myself a sense of wariness of the world and a withdrawal from it, because I didn't feel the world was trustworthy. I thought the world had to be very carefully managed I thought the world had to be very carefully managed I didn't cause any trouble. There's some complications in that two-by-two matrix and forth, but still, coming down to the heart of it, it's really pretty powerful here. The second thing I would say is that there's been a fair amount of controversy in psychology, as you note, about nature versus nurture, nature and nurture, interactions, models. Is this innate. Is it conditioned. , totally. , and there are definitely ways in which attachment styles are learned, but they're often learned in interaction with the underlying physiology and tendency. Highly introverted, highly extroverted, highly introverted, born with, let's say, a very vulnerable nervous system as perhaps a premature baby.",

There are all of these variables, they're bouncing into each other, they're combining in unpredictable ways, totally. And conceptual models just in general, whenever we talk about a conceptual framework on the podcast, these models need to draw really sharp lines between categories because that's how we test things, we put things into different boxes in order to understand them. Reality is a lot fuzzier, people. Also, as time has gone on, we've really come a long way in the openness we have around understanding attachment and attachment tendencies. We've broadened the idea of what is a primary caregiver. What does it mean to have a relationship with your primary caregiver. Can you have a different kind of attachment style with different groups of people. Turns out, yes, you can. For a long time we just thought that you had this one attachment style, that was how you showed up in every relationship. That was it for you. Turns out, probably not the case. A lot of this has just a lot more flexibility and fuzziness, and therefore, frankly, a changeability to it that's actually nice to remind yourself of sometimes. Wow, much happening here. One, I'm having a realization in real time about my own history, which I'll share, in that as you were getting at, people could be people form an attachment style to their peer groups, let's say. And you could even extend it further in terms of object relations theory and on to categories of people. , I was just realizing, Forrest, wow, in real time here, I used to think that I transferred my attachment style with my parents to my peer groups, because I was very young going through school, I was kind of quiet on the outside a lot. I was avoidantly attached. I'm beginning to really realize actually that part of the mix was that I had a sense of alienation and distance and fear with my peers third, fourth, fifth grade onward that I actually transferred to my parents.

And ways of keeping yourself safe fundamentally here. , anyway, the other thing I just want to say in passing is that my own career, starting in college in the, , late 60s, early 70s, and then grad school in the 80s and onward, kind of has tracked the trajectory of attachment theory, the development of it. Totally,. And in particular, when I learned about disorganized attachment, the paradigm for that were essentially children who had been taken from their parents at birth and dropped into really, really tough orphanage type situations. It wasn't even in the original model. , when I said 60, 20, 20, that adds up to 100. There was no space for a fourth group in the original model. But there was sort of, began to be a realization that there were kids who were just A, highly vulnerable in their physiology, often because they were premature or really bad stuff happened to them at a very early age. I know you're going to talk more about complex trauma here, but I think a key piece of it is that disorganized literally means that you're not organized. You're dysregulated, profoundly dysregulated. , it's not even that you kind of oscillate from one attachment style to another. You don't even, you can't even find it. , there's no stability. And that goes to one of the things we'll be talking about, how people can use relatively stable, good enough others, friends, family, partners, their own children maybe, their pet, their dog, their goldfish, if need be. But also in particular, how they can stabilize in their relationship to themselves. , we're going to be getting more and more into that, but you set it up great far. And you gave me the occasion for a personal realization. Who knew. I love this. I love a framework where I'm more the scaffolding. I'm going to just vibe with stuff. I actually think it works pretty for us. , to bounce off of some of what you were just saying. And by the way, Forrest, this is a preview of 20, 30 years from now. Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure.

Anyways, crossing my fingers. , back of a napkin. , we're probably about one in 20 people ballpark. That's our current best guesstimate. Have more of a fearful style. My personal bet is that number remains a little low, actually, for a whole bunch of different complicated reasons. Really. Because when I was a kid, as a word, grad school, it was considered one in a hundred. one percent, one in a thousand. , my guess for that is that the way that we find these numbers in part is based on very early childhood experiences. And working and looking at kids, who are quite young. ,. , let's say that you start relatively securely attached in life. Or let's say you're insecure, but you're anxious, you're avoidant. You wouldn't be classified as having a fearful attachment style. You go through life. You end up in a relationship when you're 22 years old. Turns out that relationship is a very unhealthy relationship. It is disorganized in its character. There is an inconsistency in the way that you're engaging with that person that you're with that could go all the way up to abuse. You feel you're constantly being ping-ponged back and forth. Maybe you're breaking up and getting back together and breaking up and getting back together. You could imagine somebody who's going through that kind of an experience. What's the lasting impact of that going forward in that person's relationships. I think that we're just kind of kidding ourselves if we say, oh, that person remains securely attached or they remain anxiously attached. No, that person had an experience. And I don't know if we're capturing that when we say, oh, we looked at a group of a bunch of eight-year-olds and this is our guess about the distribution of attachment styles. It's interesting what you're getting at. We tend to think about attachment styles being developed zero to three. And static. , totally. And I just don't know if that's the case. Evolving some layers, definitely with opportunities for healing, but really quite layered in.",

    "output": "But you're bringing into the really important nuance that we're talking about later in life, things can happen. Stuff happens. Bad can tilt you one way or another. The thing that I find useful as a frame here is to think of just the meaning of the word attachment style. It's a way of attaching. And it's a way that works. For example, in my case, avoid an attachment style which overlaps the -called schizoidal style or pattern in relationships. Even without a formal psychopathological diagnosis, still, it's about optimal distance and never really landing into full intimacy nor breaking away into full self-expression and individuation. avoidantly attached people tend to orbit their primary attachment figures. That's a way of being in relationship. Distance in the service of connection. Then we have more that anxious, insecure style,. Kind of a clinging complaint to some extent. But it's a way of relating. Staying very, very vigilant. Not letting the attachment figure get out of your sight. Fussing to draw their attention in. But never really being satisfied with it. It's a way to relate. And then we have secure attachment as another way to relate as. The problem with disorganized, it's not even a way of attaching. Because it's the thing that characterizes it, is that there is no stable way of attaching. Not avoiding, not avoidant rather, not anxious, not secure. There's no way at all. And that, for profoundly social primates us, is really devastating and very, very scary. I think the fearfulness, if you will, is on the heels of. It's the result of the underlying lack of any stably successful in its way mode of relating to others. , I want to give a couple of quick caveats about what I was saying earlier because I was playing kind of fast and loose as you were saying with how we think about attachment theory. the first caveat to give is that what we often find is that people who wind up in more disorganized adult relationships or adult relationships that have that kind of chaos in them, tend to have a background where they were in a more disorganized environment growing up. It's relatively uncommon for people who had a very stable, predictable, safe household environment to land in relationships that. It does happen, I don't want to dismiss it, but it's certainly less common.",

We may still have some vulnerabilities, , but on the whole, we can certainly grow and develop and have a full and rich life. I got to ask you about something that you said as part of that kind of took me by surprise there. you were talking about recognizing ways of coping that you have currently, and your list was that the person might be relying on putting themselves in more extreme emotional situations. They might be, even you said, gambling, drugs, all of that kind of stuff, classic coping mechanisms. what do you mean learning from that. What does learning from that in a useful way look. Because most people, I think, would see that list and just be , these are bad things, don't do them. Oh, that's interesting. I think there's certain things we develop in certain occupations. I imagine that maybe as an attorney you would develop a sense of threat. Because that's what your work would be. You see a lot of people that bad things have happened to. , in law enforcement. Or you would see something that. I think as a therapist, you often can sort of, how can I put it, you embrace the shadow. You embrace, you look for what's left out and embrace it and appreciate it. And look for the sincere intentions in it, , the good intentions underlying it. it's about recognizing the function. , totally. , that's. Particularly the useful function. And how there could be some useful internal exploration around that. , joining with the defense and in a sense joining with the coping mechanism initially while looking for, , what might be some nuances of improvement here, , down the road.

These, for most people most of the time, these relatively early experiences of things not being allowed to come out of you, or that you just didn't get from the world as a whole. And at some point that stuff, I think, most of the time does have to get kind of unearthed in order to really make big progress with this kind of stuff. I mean, not only always maybe there are some other approaches or techniques that I'm just not as familiar with. But I think maybe because I'm a little psychodynamically oriented, I just think that's a big piece of it for most people. There's kind of a paradox that the more that we are full-throated and wholehearted in what we communicate, the less we need perfect attunement from others. , great point. It's when we're beating around the bush a little bit or kind of sort of hinting or figuring that they really ought to be picking up on these fleeting micro-expressions on our face and then that's when we want a lot more attunement from others. We want them to come get us. That's understandable. , the classic Runaway Bunny stuff or the peek-a-boo games or Winnicott's beautiful line, a joy to be hidden, a disaster not to be found. We want rescue. We want to be sought. We want them to keep coming for us.

Stick around. for the rest of the show. we have bid farewell to Rick here, but there were still some things that I wanted to get in toward the end of this episode focused more on helping people work with their disorganized attachment style or otherwise develop some of the key strengths, some of the key abilities that could really help somebody who had disorganized attachment. And as we go through this, I'm probably going to reference some other things that we talked about today, it's also going to be a bit of a recap.

    "output": "And this means that there's generally a lot of overlap between the recommendations that you would get for trauma work and the recommendations that you get for working with disorganized attachment. if a lot of this sounds kind of familiar, that's probably why. There are a number of approaches to therapy, including somatics, emotionally focused therapy, IFS, that are more relational or more trauma-informed kind of by their nature, and that's why I think that this is a really important topic. We had a great conversation with Dr. Bruce Perry years ago. He's been on the podcast a number of times, and he talked about how when kids are exposed to traumatic environments growing up, their brain doesn't develop the same way that kids who are in perfectly secure environments develop. And approaches to therapy that are designed for somebody who has a lot of top-down cognitive control, a lot of executive function, are not necessarily going to be great for somebody who went through more traumatic experiences growing up. And it's kind of the same thing for working with disorganized attachment styles. A lot of what we were talking about today was not that kind of procedural, behavioral framework that we often wander toward in the show, because I want to give people things to do. I want you to have a checklist, I want you to have some how-to, I want you to have a really good sense of what's going to get you off of the ride that you're on that you don't want to be on and onto one that you much prefer. And I think disorganized attachment is not always clean and procedural in that kind of a way. It's often a lot fuzzier almost by its nature. And I thought that piece of advice that Rick gave, which just blew my socks off, about fully embracing what it is that you really want, the big, seemingly over-the-top request or desire for that connection, attunement, relationship, or for people to really understand where you're coming from, or for them to be a certain kind of way around you, whatever it is, is a really great example of the kinds of things that do tend to work for people who are more disorganized. It's not much a checklist.",

Some people tend to be more anxious, some tend to be more avoidant. a lot of this is about self-awareness. What is your unique batch of problems. And a great way in understanding what that is, is appreciating another thing that Rick was talking about that kind of piqued my interest when he said it. Appreciating your coping style. What do you do to regulate yourself. What do you do to cope. And what experiences did those coping styles emerge out of. This is called creating a coherent narrative. We talk about it on the podcast all the time. And it's looking back over things and going, what the heck happened there. And what's the tip of the root for me. What is the core emotional experience that I did not get. What were the steps along the journey that maybe some other people got. Because I've got a friend who's more securely attached, or I can just kind of see other people out in the world, good examples of other people where I look at them and I go, wow, I would really to be a little bit more in my relationships the way that person is. Those kinds of models can be very helpful for us. What did they get that I didn't get. How were their experiences different from mine. What's the big gap here. And this process helps us become much more aware of what we really need, what our specific vulnerabilities are, and frankly, what our strengths are as that might have emerged out of those experiences. Experiences, even truly horrible experiences, often have aspects of them that can lead to the development of some kind of a strength.",

    "output": "Because you really had to build a muscle of some kind or another to get through what was going on. What was that muscle for you. And that piece of the process, that more self-respect, self-appreciation aspect here, can be really helpful for people with a disorganized attachment style, because they often really struggle to build up that self-compassion, to build up that sense of themselves as a worthy, important person, just the same way that anybody else is. Often for people, a core piece that is missing are different aspects of a self-regulation. This is the ability to keep yourself comfortable in different kinds of circumstances. Because disorganized attachment is often developmentally rooted, people with it tend to not have had good self-regulation modeled to them. Their parents weren't good at regulating themselves, the environments were all over the place, again, as we talked about quite a bit during the conversation. there just weren't a lot of great examples of what that really looked. And if you can't self-regulate it is very difficult to solve problems in a self-respecting manner inside of your relationship. Because when something threatening comes along, you're going to immediately move into a coping strategy. This is the fight response, flight, freeze, fawn, those kinds of classic stress responses. It could be self-abandonment, which we've talked about on the podcast a lot, fuzzy boundaries, excessively high walls, whatever it is for you. We've talked about different aspects of this process, and we've done dedicated episodes to things working with the different stress responses, improving self-regulation, dealing with dissociation, all of these different aspects of disorganized attachment. And there's more information in those episodes that's specific about how to do that. If I actually walked through how to do all of those things, this would be a five-hour episode or something that. But a great place to start is that more feely, fuzzy, bottom-up aspect of this whole thing that I think Rick was really getting to, in the advice that he gave throughout the episode. part of that can be appreciating the aspects of who you are that are more frightened or avoidant or anxious. Letting those parts out of the basement, letting them into the light, feeling some of the feelings that accompany that, and then appreciating why they feel the way that they do.",

    "output": "Keeping your commitments to yourself, maintaining a boundary, not being excessively harsh on yourself if things fall apart, because things will inevitably fall apart. That's the way that this process is. It is a process of two steps. One step forward, one and a half steps back, and then you keep going. But going, oh, , I fell down that time, and I'm going to recommit to it. I fell down that time, and I'm going to do it a little bit differently next time. I'm going to learn from that experience. And this is going to help you build up a sense of self-trust and self-reliability, and there's going to be a parallel process where as you develop that in yourself, you can start to find it in your relationships. You can trust yourself a little bit, and you can trust others a little bit in a careful, -managed way. Of course, don't hand a stranger your baby. Be rational, be responsible, trust is conditional. But you're not walking around with the metaphorical safety off, , ready to blow somebody away because there was a minor breach of rapport. You are not deeply convinced that you are just a piece of shit who's going to constantly fall apart in this way. We've brought the extremes in a little bit here as part of this process. what does a reliable relationship really look and feel to somebody who has a disorganized attachment style. To somebody who doesn't feel good in closeness, and also doesn't feel good in distance, , what does a good, healthy, reliable relationship look and feel. Rick alluded to this. A lot of the time, it looks and feels boring. For people who have a lot of experience in dysfunctional relationships, romantic or otherwise, stable ones often feel quite boring. Because not a lot happens in them. I you, you me, we're just kind of here. They include predictability, and consistency, and emotional validation, and they aren't punishment-oriented.

    "output": "It's very hard to define trauma in a way. Is it external. Is it internal. Is it the event. Is it the reaction. But basically, the way I to say it, it's something that overwhelms your capacity to cope and nobody else takes over for you at a particular point. , and then you get stuck. And your whole central nervous system continues to experience the ongoing world through the lens of that particular overwhelming experience. you continue to be constantly scared or feel people are going to attack you or feeling you're going to be left for dead. And you continue to react to oftentimes fairly trivial challenges as if it is a catastrophe. And it's really the ongoing reaction that really defines what trauma is about. It's that your mind and your brain gets changed by trauma and then from then on, you live in this traumatic, internal world. the trauma lives inside of you, basically. In the country in which you now live and practice, the United States, do , do we know how prevalent trauma is. Is it even possible to measure it. , there's things you can measure. Incidents of domestic violence. In the US, it's about one out of three couples engages in domestic violence. One out of three. And probably in the UK, it would be similar. Can we just pause there a minute. That is a staggering amount. , I think every relationship is a miracle. , to put up with each other, we drive each other a little bit crazy. For people to actually get along and live close together and having to make adjustments with each other is a very complex thing. But it takes a fair amount of maturity actually and being able to understand other people's point of view. I think it is precious for us to be able to understand what we're going through. It's precious for people to be able to get along with each other. And oftentimes they don't. And let's take it away from domestic violence for a minute. This is an idea I've been really playing around with, and it's kind of, is it external, is it internal. An external event happens. The same external event could happen to 100 people, and 100 people are not all going to have the same response.",

Some people, I'm guessing, may not be traumatized from the same incident. if our responses are individual to external events, is it easy for us to see how prevalent trauma is in society. Because on one level trauma, whether an event is traumatic or not, actually depends on how we perceive it and our internal response. Not only how we perceive it, but how our personal or router's perceive it. you may look a very put together person, and people say they clearly didn't get affected by the particular incident. But basically I to say, you don't know somebody until you marry them for some length of time. , we all have our personas. And somebody may be calm and brilliant under certain situations, and something minor happens, and they blow up. But we may never get to see that. it's very hard to know as an outsider who has survived the trauma and to what degree people have. And in my world, they say, oh, some people are resilient. Really. Are you sure. , how do people wake up with diapers. Or do they actually freeze in front of their children and become all uptight and don't respond to their kids' needs. That wouldn't be rated as being a trauma. They're not being post-traumatic. Just, I saw that all the time in many of my patients, particularly my German patients. They all had these traumatized parents, and that was very quiet. A household. nobody ever talked, nobody talked about anything.

It's rock songs are being written about the body keeps its core. Oh, you can retire now, you made it. That's crazy. You made it. That's crazy. But it's not true that the body remembers, but you lived out the traumas through your, to the periphery of your body, how your muscles tense up. As somebody said way before me, an angry person lives in an angry body. A depressed person lives in a depressed body. You carry these things inside of you. Very meaningful to me, because I think, , I'm not a person who's always trying to be a hero, I'm not a person who's always trying to be a hero, I'm a person who's always trying to be a hero, I think watching those old videos and I'm an expert on, but I love that when I read a big social literature, and looking at it, I find that I've.

Which served you for a period of time perhaps, but it's no longer serving you. And I think people tell me that information in my book was helpful for them. I'm not much of a cognitive therapist. I don't think you'd buy that. I don't think you'd buy that. I don't think you'd be advising people up much by doing that. But a lot of people say, yes, understanding that this happened to me makes me not feel crazy. I think that's the big thing. Oh, I can't feel my body because I shut down my context, my body, because I was being molested all the time. And that's how I learned to cope. As Dick Schwartz, who invented IFS, which about, says, all parts are welcome because every part of you used to fulfill a function. There's a reason why your body can't feel anything. For me, it's always how interesting that you cannot feel when you have to go to the bathroom, rather than you bad person, you can't feel that. It's , that's fascinating. I mean, most people can. How does that happen. And you find always, and that's why the trauma model becomes terribly important. You said you're not much of a cognitive therapist. And. The thing I've been really sort of playing with in my mind, particularly because I knew I was going to meet you again and talk to you, is that there's multiple ways to heal. I think for most things, there's multiple ways to heal. And people all have their own biases over the therapies that they've seen that work for them. And then they think that the same therapy is going to work for everyone. It's kind of , that's certainly not how I see the world. But. If the body. If the body keeps the score. And many of us live in a very head-based society, where we try and think our way through issues. Can you heal trauma with thought alone. Or do you have to deal with the body as. I don't have the answer for that. , because I only see people who I see. And there may be all sorts of people out there.",

    "output": "No reaction means no data for them to work with. You become a closed system. A mystery. And that makes you more powerful than any verbal retaliation ever could. Another reason indifference works is because it centers your energy on yourself, not them. It's a reclaiming of internal space. While confrontation places your focus on trying to change or fix the narcissist, indifference shifts your attention back to your own peace. Your own goals. Your own emotional safety. It's a boundary in action. You're no longer negotiating terms of respect. You've already decided what you will and won't tolerate in your living accordingly. The narcissist may try harder at first. They may escalate their tactics, desperate to get some kind of reaction. They might swing between fake remorse and sudden rage. But the consistency of your indifference is what breaks the cycle. You're not feeding the drama anymore. You're not available for emotional games. You're just done. Not as a performance, but as a state of being. And there is nothing more destabilizing to someone who thrives on reaction than being met with a calm, quiet refusal to engage. Truth destabilizes their illusion of control. At the core of narcissism lies a fragile self-position built on deception. Both self-deception and the manipulation of others. Narcissists create a false identity. A carefully constructed persona that is designed to elicit admiration, fear, loyalty or pity depending on the situation. But this identity is not rooted in authenticity. It's a defensive illusion crafted to conceal deep insecurity, shame and emotional immaturity. The narcissist's control over others relies on the success of this illusion. They must be seen as superior. Righteous, untouchable or tragically misunderstood. They manipulate perception in order to dominate reality. Truth is the antidote to this deception. It's a mirror that reflects back what the narcissist cannot afford to see. It reveals their contradictions, their emotional volatility, their inconsistency, their dependency on others for validation. And truth is spoken plainly, calmly and without fear. It disrupts the carefully curated image they have worked hard to maintain. They lose their composure because the truth, threatens to collapse the fantasy. It exposes them not only to others but to themselves. And that is unbearable. What makes truth dangerous to a narcissist is that it cannot be controlled or rebranded. It stands on its own, unshaken by their theatrics.",

    "output": "While a narcissist might try to distort reality through gaslighting, denial or projection, truth persists. It's the quiet presence in the room that cannot be silenced. And when someone in their life refuses to be manipulated, when someone insists on seeing things as they are, rather than how the narcissist wants them to appear, it causes a fracture in their control. That fracture grows every time the truth is repeated, affirmed or simply lived. This isn't just about verbal truth, it's also behavioural. When your actions are aligned with what to be true, it sends a message. If the narcissist is abusive and you leave, then you leave, that's truth. If they lie and you stop listening, that's truth. If they lack empathy and you stop expecting emotional reciprocity, that's truth. These choices are more powerful than any confrontation because they make the illusion unworkable. The narcissist depends on your belief in their false reality to sustain it. Without your cooperation, their illusion begins to rot. Narcissists are often adept at surrounding themselves with enablers, people who overlook, excuse or reinforce their delusions in exchange for peace, approval or security. But when even one person stops playing along and begins to live and speak according to truth, it disrupts the entire system. It sends a ripple through the structure of lies. And because the narcissist is deeply invested in being perceived a certain way, this can provoke an intense, even violent reaction. They may attack your credibility, play the victim, or attempt to isolate you. All of this is a desperate attempt to reassert control, to patch the illusion that is beginning to fall apart. It's important to understand that the narcissist's need for control is not just about dominating others. It's about controlling the narrative. They don't simply want to be something. They want everyone to believe it, even when it's false. That belief grants them power. when truth emerges, especially when it's undeniable, it strips them of that power. They are forced into a position where they must either face the truth or escalate their manipulation to even more extreme levels. Most will choose the latter, because facing the truth would mean acknowledging their own insufficiency. And that threatens the very foundation of their identity. Truth doesn't always need to be loud or dramatic to be effective.",

    "output": "You are no longer reacting to them, they are reacting to you. They begin to feel a child seeking approval from a parent, desperate for your validation, but unable to truly earn it, because they cannot match your integrity. Over time, if you remain consistent in your self-respect, the narcissist may become increasingly vulnerable, and they will be dependent on you. Not because you are giving them what they want, but because your stability becomes their only anchor. They crave what you represent, peace, clarity, certainty. But they do not know how to generate those things for themselves. they stay close, even if you are no longer feeding their ego. They may not understand it consciously, but on a deeper level, they recognize that your strength gives them a structure to lean on. You are no longer a mirror reflecting their fantasy, you have become a mirror reflecting reality. And they cannot walk away from that, even if it infuriates them. This dependence becomes a source of psychological tension for the narcissist. On one hand, they resent your self-respect, because it exposes their lack of it. On the other hand, they are drawn to it, because it provides a kind of emotional order they cannot create alone. They begin to follow your lead in subtle ways, altering their behavior just to remain in your presence. They may act more respectful, more thoughtful, or more honest, not because they have changed, but because your boundaries demand it. You have become the standard. And in doing , you have reversed the dynamic entirely. Self-respect also limits the narcissist's ability to gaslight or distort reality. When your worth, you do not question your perception, just because someone tries to invalidate it. You are less likely to be manipulated by guilt or flattery, and far more likely to trust your instincts. This makes you unpredictable in the narcissist's eyes. They can no longer anticipate your reactions, because you are no longer reacting. You are responding. With intention. With restraint. With sovereignty. Power lies in consistency, not emotional reaction. When dealing with a narcissist, the biggest mistake most people make is believing that strong emotional responses, whether anger, sadness, pleading, or confrontation, will change the dynamic. The narcissist actually feeds off these reactions. They provoke, push, and manipulate specifically to draw out emotion, because emotion signals engagement, and engagement is control.",

    "output": "But consistent behaviour, saying no when you mean no, walking away when you need space, enforcing consequences without yelling or blaming, preserves your energy. It keeps you rooted in your own values, rather than constantly adjusting to the narcissist's behaviour. Over time, this creates an internal shift. You stop asking how to change them, and instead focus entirely on how to stay true to yourself. Eventually, the narcissist begins to realise they can't shake you. They can't bait you into arguments. Or guilt you into submission. Or flatter you into forgetting. They see that no matter what tactic they use, you respond the same way. With calm, consistent adherence to your truth. That predictability becomes a fortress. It frustrates them, weakens their grip, and forces them to confront the reality that their manipulation no longer works. In some cases, they may escalate in a desperate attempt to break through. But even that is a sign of their diminishing control, not their strength. You are no longer reacting, you are leading. And in the world of a narcissist, that shift is revolutionary. The narcissist becomes enslaved by the strength they can't manipulate. Narcissists are naturally drawn to people they believe they can control. Those who seek approval, who avoid conflict, who bend their own needs to maintain harmony. These individuals are not weak. In fact, they are often bent by the power of their own strength. They are deeply empathetic, thoughtful, and resilient. But the narcissist sees these qualities as openings. They interpret kindness as submission, forgiveness as permission, and emotional depth as vulnerability they can exploit. As long as they can manipulate those traits to their advantage, they feel powerful. But everything begins to shift the moment they encounter a strength they cannot manipulate. This kind of strength is not loud or aggressive. It is quiet, steady, and rooted in self-awareness. It is the ability to say no without guilt, to walk away from dysfunction without explanation, and to stay calm in the face of provocation. When a person embodies this kind of internal power, the narcissist is disarmed. Their usual tools, shame, guilt, flattery, gaslighting, no longer work. They try to push buttons, but the buttons no longer respond. They attempt to trigger emotions, but are met with clarity instead. They try to provoke chaos, but are answered with stillness.

What began as a pursuit of dominance ends in psychological servitude. The narcissist becomes a prisoner of their own failed conquest, locked in orbit around the one person who refused to be conquered. Life is suffering. And sometimes, that suffering comes in a form that's almost too much to bear in the presence of a narcissist. It's easy to believe you've been cursed, that some grave mistake has placed you in the orbit of someone who manipulates, distorts, and consumes. But what if, and listen carefully, what if that's not a mistake at all. What if it's precisely where you're supposed to be. When you are placed in the life of a narcissist, your first instinct is often to wonder why you are being punished. You feel trapped, isolated, unseen. Their manipulation, their deceit, their insatiable hunger for validation drains you until you begin to question your own reality. It is easy to imagine that you are enduring some cosmic injustice, some undeserved burden placed upon your shoulders. But this interpretation, while understandable, is fundamentally incomplete. What if suffering isn't a punishment at all. What if, instead, it is a deliberate and necessary preparation for something far greater than you can currently comprehend. Human beings are not designed to stay in comfort indefinitely. Comfort breeds weakness, complacency, and forgetfulness. In contrast, suffering awakens attention. It shakes you awake from the dream of entitlement and the reality of what is real. When you find yourself entangled with a narcissist, it forces you to develop skills and insights that you would never have needed otherwise. You must learn discernment. You must strengthen your boundaries. You must cultivate an inner resilience that no shallow life could have ever demanded of you. The narcissist, while appearing as an adversary, inadvertently serves as a catalyst for your evolution. The fundamental nature of suffering is transformative. It strips away illusions. It is a childish fantasy that life is meant to be easy or fair. And while this may sound brutal, it is in fact an act of severe mercy.

    "output": "It often takes an extraordinary encounter with darkness to reveal what has been lurking beneath the surface all along. When you find yourself entangled with a narcissist, it is not merely an external battle you are fighting, it is an unveiling of the internal vulnerabilities you have carried with you, often since childhood, sometimes without any awareness that they exist. A narcissist's behavior operates a magnet for unconscious weakness. They are finely tuned to detect where your boundaries are weak, where your sense of self is fragile, where your craving for love can be exploited. Without realizing it, you may have opened the door to manipulation not because you were foolish, but because some part of you is still waiting for validation, still yearning to be seen, still hoping to earn love through sacrifice. The narcissist mirrors back to you the parts of yourself that you have neglected, the parts that are unguarded and unhealed, the parts that are unfulfilled. This confrontation can be devastating because it strikes at the very heart of your self-imagined. You may have believed yourself strong, discerning, independent, yet here you are, doubting your reality, second-guessing your instincts, trapped in cycles of hope and despair. This dissonance forces a critical realization. Strength is not merely how you appear when life is easy, it is what remains standing when everything you trusted is called into question. The narcissist's intrusion into your life takes away the superficial layers, leaving only what is real. And often, what is real includes pain, insecurity, and deep-seated patterns of self-betrayal. The exposure of unconscious weakness is not an act of cruelty by the universe, it is a vital and brutal kindness. Until you see these weaknesses, you cannot address them. Until you confront them, you cannot transcend them. A narcissist's relentless self-centeredness forces you to recognize where you have abandoned your own needs, where you have tolerated disrespect, where you have made yourself small in the futile hope of being loved or accepted. Every moment of confusion, every instance of self-doubt is a clue pointing you back toward the hidden structures within you that need reinforcement. Human beings are masters at avoiding uncomfortable truths. We rationalize, we excuse, we look the other way. But in the presence of a narcissist, avoidance becomes impossible. Their distortions and manipulations are relentless that the psychological pressure is unbearable. Something must break.",

The narcissist's endless demands, their manipulations and gaslighting create the exact environment necessary to reveal to you where your boundaries are missing or too weak to sustain you. In the quiet aftermath of every argument, every betrayal, every moment where you felt yourself disappearing, the voice inside you grows louder, insisting that this cannot continue. The emergence of boundaries is painful. It requires sacrifice. It demands that you let go of the illusion that you can please everyone, that you can fix the broken, that love alone can heal someone who refuses to be healed. It forces you to recognize that your responsibility is not to save others at the cost of yourself, but to guard the sacred space of your own mind, heart and soul. The chaos inflicted by the narcissist becomes the crucible in which your boundaries are shaped, hammered out through sorrow and anger and the desperate need for clarity. Every moment you are tested is an invitation to rise. Every time you feel the chaos closing in, you are presented with a choice. Collapse into confusion or stand firm in your truth. The small, hesitant no that escapes your lips the first time you resist their manipulation becomes stronger with every repetition. What begins as a tremor of rebellion evolves into an unshakable stance. Through the testing, through the chaos, you begin to see the outline of the person you are meant to become. A person who does not betray themselves who does not shrink back into silence when their dignity is on the line. Chaos is the necessary environment for growth because it strips away pretense. It forces you to decide who you are when nothing is stable, when no one is validating you, when standing up for yourself costs you love, approval, or even your sense of belonging. It is easy to imagine yourself strong when no one is attacking you. It is another thing entirely to maintain your integrity when the ground beneath you is shaking and every voice around you demands that you surrender. Boundaries are born, not in peace, but in the fire of these tests when survival itself demands that you carve out sacred space where your soul cannot be violated.",

Courage is the strength to see clearly even when everything in you wants to look away. It is the decision to confront reality on its own harsh terms rather than clinging to comforting illusions. It is the willingness to stand alone if necessary to risk disapproval, rejection and even isolation in the service of truth. Truth itself becomes the next essential virtue. Narcissists thrive in environments where truth is obscured, where reality is bent and twisted to suit their needs. They gaslight, they manipulate language, they construct elaborate narratives that justify their behavior and paint you as the villain. In such an environment, holding on to the truth is an act of profound defiance. It requires not just intellectual clarity but moral integrity. You must decide that you will not participate in the lie, that you will not contort yourself to make the falsehood seem plausible. The commitment to truth is not simply about exposing the narcissist. It is about remaining loyal to your own perception, your own experiences, your own soul. Resilience emerges as you endure the aftermath of these encounters. Facing evil is never a single moment of recognition. It is an ongoing battle against the erosion of your spirit. Every betrayal, every manipulation, every attempt to undermine your reality chips away at your reserves of strength. Resilience is the ability to keep going even when you are exhausted, disillusioned and heartbroken. It is the determination to heal, to rebuild, to trust yourself again even after your trust has been shattered. It is the capacity to remain open to life, to love, to growth without allowing the trauma to define your future. These virtues are not given lightly. They are forged through suffering, through struggle, through the agonizing process of being torn away from naivety and thrown into the complexity of human darkness. You do not develop courage, truth and resilience by reading about them or by wishing for them. They are born in you through the necessity of survival, through the desperate need to reclaim your dignity in a situation that seeks to strip it away. You become courageous because the alternative is annihilation. You become truthful because the alternative is madness. You become resilient because the alternative is permanent victimhood.",

It strips away the superficial markers of virtue, niceness, politeness, conformity and demands the real thing. It forces you to embody the values you once admired from a distance. In confronting the darkness outside you, you are also confronting the darkness within. The parts of yourself that are tempted to retaliate, to hate, to despair. Mastery over evil is not achieved through violence or dominance but through the cultivation of virtues that evil cannot corrupt. Survival is the first instinct when you are trapped in the gravitational pull of a narcissist's world. Every day becomes a battle to maintain some shred of sanity, to protect what remains of your identity to endure the relentless erosion of your dignity. But survival, while necessary, is not the ultimate goal you have been called to. Simply escaping the clutches of the narcissist is not the full measure of your journey. There is something greater, something deeper that demands your attention. You are not merely meant to crawl out of the darkness with your life intact. You are meant to rise from it transformed, empowered and capable of lighting the path for others still trapped within it. The pain you endured, the lessons you paid for with your own blood and tears are not just for you. They are entrusted to you as a sacred responsibility. There are countless others who, you once were, are blind to the reality they are living in. They doubt themselves, blame themselves, stay silent out of fear and shame. Your survival gives you the authority to speak, but your transcendence gives you the power to lead. To transcend is to turn your wounds into wisdom, your scars into signposts that mark the way out of the labyrinth of confusion and despair. The narcissist sought to diminish you, to control you, to mold you into a reflection of their own brokenness. In refusing to be destroyed, in reclaiming your autonomy, you defy everything they stood for. But more than that, by healing, by growing, by stepping into your full power, you become an agent of liberation for others. Every truth you speak shatters a piece of the web of lies that narcissists depend on. To maintain their illusion.",

Who knows. The family looks perfect. There is love. There is harmony. There is caring and compassion and affection. There is attentiveness. Everyone is there for each other. Except for you. something is wrong with you. The family is perfect. The imperfection is all yours. We know that narcissistic families, families who are not perfect, families who incorporate narcissists. The narcissist could be parental figures. The narcissistic mother. The narcissistic father. The narcissist could be siblings. Your sister. Your brother. narcissistic families present a facade. A facade of harmony. Narcissistic families are much more concerned with appearances rather than substance. And this facade of harmony is known in clinical terms as pseudo-mutuality. Fake mutuality. Fake love. Fake concern. Fake support. Fake succor. The emphasis is on the word fake as you have gathered by now. And there are families which are equally narcissistic or infested by narcissists which present a facade of disharmony. There is a lot of constant bickering, arguments, fights, debates and even physical violence. This is known as pseudo-hostility. In both cases, the pseudo-mutual family and the pseudo-hostile family, the members of the dysfunctional family, are not allowed to separate and individuate. They are subjected to a power asymmetry in cult- settings. Some members of the family have all the power. Some members of the family are totally dependent and disempowered. And the whole family functions as a cult. We against they. The external world, the outside world is hostile. It's a jungle. These are enemies. And everything should remain within the family. All the processes are internalized. Nothing is ever externalized, not even aggression. Aggression within the family is simply redirected at one of its members, also known as the scapegoat. The family homeostasis, the precarious balance that keeps the family together, the glue that holds the members of the family within the same unit, is threatened by honesty. When one of the members is honest, one of the members of the family is honest, the king is naked. This threatens the balance of this kind of family. The family demands compliance. The family demands submission. The family demands conformity. The family demands, in other words, silence.",

It all revolves around honesty. Such families, and these are of course dysfunctional families, despise and detest and hate honesty. The greatest threat is honesty. Because these families are constructed around a denial of their own problems. The problems should never be discussed. No one should acknowledge the very existence of any problem. The family is perfect. If there are any apparent problems, they are exactly that, apparent. And they will go away. They are temporary. And they'll probably, these problems probably, have been imported from the outside. The outside world has caused this problem. Because the family in itself, as an isolated unit, is perfect.

And the reason for bullying is to deflect attention from real problems. These families, of course, are dysfunctional. These families are dangerous. These families are pseudo-mutual. It's a fake, it's a facade. These families are, in other words, not families. Whatever they are, they are not families in any meaningful sense. And yet, the pretension to be a family is the most important thing. And anyone who challenges it, anyone who undermines it, anyone who doubts it, should be penalized.

Because people gravitate towards power. Bullying is perceived as power. It's a misperception, of course. Bullying is a strong indication of fear, panic, and weakness. But it is misperceived frequently as a kind of power. And members of the family gravitate towards the powerful, the powerful sibling, the powerful parent. And they collude with this individual to bully others within the family. The scapegoat role the role of the scapegoat within the family is integrally a part of the cult- settings. These families operate exactly the way cults do. There is brainwashing. There is coercion. There are threats and intimidation. There is guilt-tripping. There is shaming. Rebecca Mandeville calls it the family scapegoating abuse, or FSA. Behaviors common in these families involve bullying, harassment, control, coercion, intimidation, including atmospheric, atmospheric and ambient intimidation, unspoken, not spelled out, and yet very present. Gaslighting, the reality, the perception of reality, the gauging of reality of the scapegoat is challenged. The scapegoat is made to believe that something is wrong with them. They're misperceiving reality. They're misreading it somehow. And there's a lot of defamation and smears. For example, members of the nuclear family would defame and slander and libel the scapegoat to members of the extended family, aunts, uncles, grandfathers, grandmothers. Within such families, there are monopolies of truth. In other words, truth is undebatable. Truth is decided by a select group or an individual within the hostile family. And only that individual has a monopoly of the truth. Whatever this individual says must be. There's no arguing. There's no challenging. There's no debating. There's no discourse. There's no communication. A single individual dictates what is true and what is not, what is and just and what is wrong and unjust. This individual is the bully.

They're about to die. And control is crucial because it maintains the facade and the appearance of a cohesive, functional family. There's a need to control everything. There's a need to control information. There's a need to control emotions. There's a need to control behavior. There's a need to control the hierarchy. Who is on top. Who is at the bottom. There's a need to control the roles. Each one has a role. The scapegoat has the role of the scapegoat. The golden child has the role of a golden child. The mother plays the mother.

Betraying the scapegoat. And then claiming that it's not true. There has been no betrayal. This is known as betrayal blindness. Rejecting the scapegoat. Ostracism. Socially, emotionally, and otherwise. Not providing the scapegoat with any share of the resources of the family. the golden child gets everything the scapegoat gets nothing. And it is as if the scapegoat is not alive. It's a denial of the very existence and visibility of the scapegoat. It's a pretension that the scapegoat is no longer with the family. The core issue in such families is what I call the repression ethos. The repression ethos is that you should never discuss some things. You should never discuss the family's dynamics. You should never discuss the family's power structure. You should never discuss justice in such a family. You should never discuss your emotions. Emotions are delegitimized.

And we need to do that, or one of the ways of doing that is connecting to the trauma, but then moving through the trauma. I've done no small. I've done no small amount of talk therapy in my life. But I've not had any therapist ever direct me to my physical sensations. Is that. That seems the. A key difference, if not the key difference between somatic experiencing and traditional talk therapy. Yes. And somatic experiencing, one of the things that is somewhat unique about it is that it works from the bottom up, from the sensations that you were describing to our physical sensations. To our feelings, but also to our emotions, but also to our thoughts. And the idea in somatic experiencing is to work from the sensations, but also connect. it's not that talk therapy is bad or anything, but it's limited. And it's limited to the degree that we're not able to sense and feel these things in our. In our bodies. , in somatic experiencing, it's not a therapy per se. But really what it is, is it something that helps people do what they do better. somebody who's even a talk therapist, and we've had many, many, many of our trainees came from being talk therapists. And. And then. And getting some of these tools to also work with the body greatly enhances their ability to work also with the mind.

Again, I'm not saying that just doing something this is a miracle. But it really facilitates and. And. And.

Are you comfortable discussing that here. I won't say I'm 100 comfortable, but yes, I'm open to sharing it. I want to preface this. In somatic experience, I just said, we don't go into the trauma. when I was having these symptoms, which were basically from a violent attack and a rape, to keep my family from testifying against the mafia. our whole family, our life was threatened. But obviously, I don't want, or the therapist, my student, isn't going to take me directly into that. But in. I came to this following memory when I was four or five years old. My parents came into my bedroom. Must have been in the middle of the night or early in the morning. And they laid a train track underneath the bed, all the way around in an oval into the room. And then back into. Then back also again under the bed. And then the train was going around the track. when I awoke, I was just thrilled. And when I worked with what does it mean to feel thrilled, I could feel that in my body. I felt excited. I felt turned on. And I jumped out of bed. And I ran to the transformer. And I changed the speed. And I made the horn go toot, toot. And that memory let me know that I was carrying a burden. And I was carrying a burden. And I was carrying a burden. It was incredibly important to me. It was one of the things that I always cared for and loved, even if it was only for a relatively short period of time. And one of the things that is characteristic of people who have just experienced even the smallest amount of love in their childhood, that these people will be. That with good therapy, they will be. And then my guide took me to a new hospital, took me gradually into dealing with what led to the rape and how I was able to heal that.",

Type of imaging that's very real, that's eidetic. And that image is very important in our imaginary, that imaginary world.

And it was something that I felt deeply moved every time we had this dialogue with us. again, I figured this is something that simply isn't, is a, an imaginary image, but it's a, an imaginary image.

    "output": "Hi, I'm Chris Germer, and thanks for your interest in this topic. For the next 25 minutes, I'll make a case for self-compassion as an antidote to shame, and then after that, I'd to offer a 15-minute practice to give you a felt sense of everything I'm about to say. , for starters, self-compassion. Most of you probably already know a lot about self-compassion. However, it was not always that. Back in 2003, Kristen Neff published the Self-Compassion Scale, and her article was the only scientific article on self-compassion in the peer-reviewed psychological literature at that time. And now there are over 3,000 articles on the subject. there's a lot of interest in self-compassion, mostly coming at the heels of mindfulness. My own introduction to self-compassion was personal, through the doorway of shame. I'm a clinical psychologist with a specialization in anxiety disorders. And I suffered for 20 years from public speaking anxiety, and nothing in my clinical toolbox could fix it. I tried everything, mindfulness meditation, and exposure, and beta blockers, and cognitive restructuring, nothing helped. Until I learned loving-kindness meditation for myself. In other words, just repeating phrases , may I be safe, may I be peaceful, may I be healthy, may I live with ease. prior to that, I'd actually been meditating for at least 30 years, but never explicitly and repeatedly offering kindness to myself. And then after I started doing that, four months later, I attended a big conference at Harvard Medical School. And when I got up on stage to speak, for the first time in my adolescence, I was a doctor. And I was a doctor for a long time. And I was a doctor for a long time. And I was a doctor for a long time. And I was a doctor for a long time. And I participated. And I participated. And even though it was a came about life, the anxiety just disappeared. And this was an amazing experience for me. And also a revelation. I learned a bunch of things. , one important thing that I discovered at the time was that my anxiety disorder was actually, not an anxiety disorder at all. It was a shame disorder. , all my efforts to manage or to accept anxiety really didn't work at all and no longer did.",

Underlying shame wasn't the problem and I wasn't touching it. And you can imagine, , I used to get up on stage and talk about mindfulness, but I was, , nervous, I could hardly get out a word. And that would, needless to say, get me to think, or at least to worry that the audience would think that I was incompetent, that I was fraudulent, maybe a little stupid. these are all symptoms of shame, but I wasn't able to address it throughout that whole time. But loving kindness meditation actually gave me the love and acceptance that I desperately craved or needed, particularly when I was getting up on stage, despite being a flawed human being, despite having anxiety. And it also showed me what I'd been avoiding long, namely shame. And also interestingly, self-compassion started to address my shame even before I knew I had shame. In other words, it was only when I had the resource of self-compassion that I was actually even able to see shame. And I also discovered at the time that when we're in the grip of intense and disturbing emotions shame, sometimes, we need to hold ourselves first before we can hold our experience. that's actually the subtle difference between mindfulness and self-compassion. Mindfulness is loving awareness of moment-to-moment experience and self-compassion is loving awareness of the experiencer, the sense of self. And we all know when somebody else is upset that first we have to pay attention to them, and then we have to pay attention to them. And we all know when somebody else is upset that first we have to pay attention to them, until they can calm down enough to be able to address the issue. Same thing with us. together, mindfulness and self-compassion are a powerful combination for managing difficult emotions. what is self-compassion. First of all, I think self-compassion is a rather unfortunate term.",

What's interesting is that in 2003, when Kristin developed this model, she wasn't aware that self-absorption, isolation, and self-compassion were a part of mindfulness. that's one of the components. Another component is self-sufficiency. Self-sufficiency and self-criticism are actually key features of shame. But they are. theoretically, self-compassion is the opposite of shame. And the research also bears this out. That is to say, whenever scores on the self-compassion scale increase, scores on shame scales decrease. I'm a clinical psychologist. I've always been interested in shame. And particularly the shame side of self-compassion because shame is associated with just about every psychological disorder, including anxiety, depression, substance abuse, eating disorders, personality disorders, relational conflict. If shame doesn't cause the problem, shame is often a result of the psychological condition, because of the role of shame. I'm a clinical psychologist. I'm a clinical psychologist.

Anyhow, now, I'm writing a book on self-compassion and shame 15 years after discovering the power of self-compassion to alleviate my own shame based public speaking anxiety. , what's shame. , in a nutshell, shame is a self-conscious emotion with negative self-evaluation. It's a hatred and self-hatery of the бывает. shame means I'm imagining in my mind what you are imagining about me, and it's not good. shame can be considered scorn in the eyes of another. And when we feel shame, there's always an attack on the sense of self. , for example, there's a difference between guilt and shame, which most people are aware of. Guilt means I did something wrong, and shame means I am wrong. Guilt means I made a mistake. Shame means I am a mistake. there's an attack on the self. But shame is way more common than we think. , for example, if you want to wake up in the morning at 630 a. m. and you sleep till eight, , when you wake up, you're proud. You might think, oh, gosh, I'm such a lazy person. Or if you forgot your sister's birthday, you might think, what kind of a sister am I. these are all attacks on the self.",

How often does this go on in our minds in the course of a day. Frequently. human beings are actually hardwired to fear. human beings are actually hardwired to fear. And we all feel shame. Shame served the purpose of keeping the tribe together during our evolution by making it extremely painful when we violated group norms. The tribe needed to stick together for survival. And it hurts. Shame hurts really badly emotionally. But when we break the rules. But this actually meant that we would stop doing what we were doing. And the tribe didn't have to hurt us physically in order to bring us back into line. We were already hurting emotionally when it was clear that we broke the rules. it has an evolutionary function. Most shame actually comes and goes rather quickly, especially when our tribe welcomes us back into the fold. However, when we refer to shame now as shame, it's not just shame. We're really not talking about this kind of adaptive shame that makes us stop and then review what just happened. We're talking about the shame that we carry with us everywhere we go. And that's what's known as trait shame rather than state shame. It's in us. you can say that we're all born with the capacity for shame. But we are not born feeling shame all the time. That kind of shame results from hate. That kind of shame results from how we have been treated by others. And it is not our fault. Interestingly, research shows that shame is less about doing something wrong than about being devalued by others. Even when we did nothing wrong. we can feel shame because of how we're treated even if we did nothing wrong. And when we do something wrong, we're not going to feel shame. And when we are treated badly by others, we internalize those attitudes and then we feel badly about ourselves. we can be mistreated by people in our own families, for example, in childhood. We can be mistreated by others outside the family, people whom we know. And we can also be treated badly by the culture, cultural oppression based on our identities.",

But if the culture devalues, demeans, and degrades us, that gets inside of us and causes shame. Fortunately, we can connect with a collective or with supportive people and we can actually dismantle shame. Interestingly, though. Even when shame results from our own actions, it should not be a life sentence. We shouldn't have to carry this around with us for the rest of our lives. Because our mistakes are really a product of a vast multiplicity of conditions that are beyond our control. Such as our personal history, our emotional triggers, whatever is going on at the moment. Maybe what we had for breakfast. we could say that the only true cause of anything is the use of our emotions. The only true cause of anything is the universe of interacting causes. And that is not under our control. Stuff happens. Nobody wakes up in the morning and says, gee, , I'd to do something today that I'm going to, that's going to make me feel shame for the rest of my life. Stuff happens in us and through us. We have some control but not as much as we think. therefore, we need to find a way of eventually forgiving ourselves for our mistakes. In the words of the eminent psychologist Paul Gilbert in the UK, shame is not our fault but it is our responsibility. Once we feel shame, hopefully we can learn to behave in a way that doesn't cause additional harm to ourselves and others. In other words, to learn how to work with shame. To keep shame from perpetuating itself. And shame can cripple us. For example, the shame that results from severe childhood abuse and trauma. What keeps, what makes trauma become post traumatic stress disorder is largely the shame aspect. We remove the shame aspect by increasing the self compassion aspect. And then we're much less likely to have post traumatic stress. And shame can also hold us back in some ways. For example, if we don't speak up as we should. Or maybe if we work too hard to prove our self worth because we don't actually feel as much self worth. That's the work of shame. Or maybe we're angrier than we should be.",

    "output": ", everything is perceived as kind of a threat to our self esteem because our self esteem isn't strong. Because shame is tearing it down. these are subtle ways that shame influences our lives. And also in the workplace. , shame can hold us back. Shame reduces our motivation. People who are high in self compassion are more motivated to achieve their goals. It reduces our motivation. It decreases our authenticity. When we feel shame, we don't trust ourselves. It robs us of self confidence. It makes it hard. It makes it harder to face our mistakes. If a mistake is a critique of who we are as a person, harder to face. And then we can't learn from them. Shame also makes us self absorb. We're thinking about ourselves when we are being attacked. Even if it's from within. It also makes us less creative. And it can lead to all kinds of unhelpful behaviors at the workplace. Such as isolating ourselves. Or being overly compliant. Or. Or aggression. Which is not good for anybody. Mindfulness of shame is actually the first step to alleviating shame. Mindfulness is, as I said, knowing what we're experiencing while we're experiencing it. With acceptance. Unfortunately, it's not a given that we recognize shame. Especially while it's happening within us. Shame is mostly invisible. And it certainly was for me during those decades of public speaking anxiety. I was only looking at anxiety. I couldn't see the shame. I didn't have the strength to face the shame. It was invisible. But it's actually not that shame cannot be seen. It's that we don't want to see it. It's just too painful. Denial is an intimate part of the shame experience. We also don't want to talk about shame. It's hard to say that makes me feel ashamed. But when a person can say, I feel shame. Or I'm feeling ashamed. Shame has actually already started to loosen its grip. It's a hard thing to say. But it's a powerful thing to say. To alleviate shame. another reason why shame is invisible is because shame wipes out the observer. The part of us that needs to be engaged in order to see and work with shame. It's an attack on the self. And it makes the self go small. Go silent. Go away. Just makes us want to disappear.

Checking out that we don't need to feel what we're feeling. This is all the work of shame. And sometimes, in order to avoid our shame, to check out, we engage in dubious behaviors. Such as getting angry at others because we don't, because the self blame is intense. It's actually relief to get angry at others when we have shame. Or numbing our feelings. For example, by working excessively or binging on food or alcohol. Also by throwing ourselves into risky behaviors. Which is , distracts us from how we feel. all of this makes us not present. Check out. We can't work with shame if we're not there. And a lot of these behaviors, they even lead to more shame. For example, drinking too much. Drinking too much. Drinking to not feel shame. Then we feel shame about drinking. these various forms of avoidance may actually feel better in the moment. But they actually make shame last longer. The principle is what we resist persists. But here's the good news. Avoiding shame is actually more of a problem than shame itself. Avoiding shame is more of a problem than shame itself. And when we stop avoiding shame, in other words, when we can mindfully see it, recognize it, make some space for it. And when we can meet shame and ourselves with kindness, shame then begins to recede. therefore, it's good to recognize when we're feeling shame. how do. How do when you are feeling shame. For example, what happens internally. What do you feel when you feel shame. just think for a moment. Internally, how do it. Because we do know it, don't we. When we want to know it. there might be a sinking feeling. There might be a sense of being punched in the gut. Sometimes there's tightness in the throat or the chest. Sometimes there's a sense of hollowness or emptiness in the head region. Oftentimes there's flushing in the face or tension or your skin crawls or you feel nauseous.

Sometimes people are absolutely still, sort of frozen, swallowing hard. these are ways that we can actually see when other people are feeling shame. But we can also notice in ourselves. And then also there are mental manifestations of shame. what goes on in your mind when you're feeling shame. This is good to know. Because if you can name shame, you're on the path to alleviating it. What goes on in your mind. you may notice you're being self-critical. I was saying, , I could never play tennis. I'm too uncoordinated. Could we recognize that. That kind of criticism. That's shaming. there's self-criticism, maybe a sense of inadequacy, I'm not good enough. Mentally, there's often confusion, what. Or powerlessness, vulnerability. That's common with shame. We feel profoundly vulnerable. Naked, , just Adam and Eve. Naked. Mistrust. Sense of unworthiness. Unworthiness. Incompetence. Another thing the mind does, as I mentioned before, is rumination and self-absorption. Actually, it's interesting. When people are feeling guilty, they're actually less self-absorbed and they're more likely to be able to repair a relationship if they cause somebody harm. When people are shamed, they're just self-absorbed. And they're actually less likely to do anything about it, to fix it. most of this kind of trait shame is actually not. Shame is actually not good for social relations. this is what goes on in us. We start to ruminate, become self-absorbed. the amazing thing about shame is that shame, after all this said, is mostly an illusion. It's an illusion. Shame feels really terrible. It can ruin our lives. It can ruin other people's lives. It can ruin the fact. But in the film The Wizard of Oz, when we pull back the curtain on shame, when Toto pulled back the curtain on the wizard, what was left. There was a benign showman holding a few levers,. shame is that. When we pull back the curtain of shame, when we see it through new eyes, the terrifying aspect actually withers away. what do we find when we look more closely at shame. Especially through the eyes of self-compassion. What does shame look. we discover that there are actually three paradoxes about shame, three insights. There's an illusion and there's an insight.",

And when you see that in other people, would it change your relationship to another person. Definitely. You would feel much closer at a vulnerable level, not afraid. This is an amazing insight. This is part of who we are, but we have long forgotten. What does this have to do with shame. , shame is the belief that something is wrong with us that renders us unlovable, unworthy, too flawed to be accepted just as we are. That's shame. And when we look deeply at the nature of shame, we can see that we would never feel shame if we didn't wish to be loved. , shame is the wish to be loved is the energy that sustains shame. If you didn't wish to be loved, you wouldn't care what other people were thinking about you. You would have no shame. , it's this energy, this primordial wish to be loved that actually sustains shame. here's the deal. Shame and the wish to be loved are two sides of the same coin. One side is shame. The other side is the wish to be loved. And when we turn over in the midst of shame, if we can turn over the coin and see the wish to be loved, if you notice when you're feeling shame, gripped with shame, and you can recognize, , I wouldn't feel this unless I wish to be loved. When you can see that in that moment, you will start to slip through the web of shame because in that moment, you're going to slip into a kind of, into your own self-love, into your own self-love. And you're going to slip into a kind of, into your own self-love. And you're going to slip into a kind of, into your primordial innocence. The innocence with which we were bornthat primordial wish. , connecting to the wish to be loved actually opens the door to self-compassion. More specifically, it opens the door to innocence, which in turn opens the door to self-compassion.",

And he said, and it's the same thing with narcissistic abuse, the imprint that narcissistic abuse leaves behind is very distinct, very clear, and very obvious. And that leads me into my topic today. The imprint that narcissistic abuse leaves behind is a personality, a traumatized personality that many of us get stuck in. before I go into some of the traits and characteristics of that personality, I first want to help you to understand why this happens, because I know with myself, honestly, I'm not a narcissist.

    "output": "Hey, hi everybody. My name is Jerry Wise. I've been working with individuals and families for over 45 years helping them get their family of origin out of them. This video is entitled Narcissistic Parents, Weird Mannerisms of Their Abused Adult Children. adult children of narcissists tend to have these traits and their mannerisms that we learn from abuse, from the rage, from the narcissism, from the self-centeredness, from the lack of empathy that we may have learned growing up with a narcissistic parent. One of the weird mannerisms as a result of having a narcissistic parent is the apology reflex. And you probably know what I mean by that. Adults who grow up with narcissistic parents frequently engage in almost compulsive apologizing. And we apologize for actions and circumstances that are not even our responsibility. And we develop this as a way to avoid conflict at home. those people who apologize too much. when you have apologized much. And I remember that was certainly something I found myself doing quite frequently. I mean, I would just apologize for everything. I even vaguely react to my Act 3 scapegoats very эта but here at the veins Center and type singular that I called principles of self apology to turn them into elitism behavior. Another veux me Martinus ad keinen hier ben q aku Europa wieder inne me methane he her ha mechanism cultivated from the need to appear submissive or non-threatening in the parental home, maybe even to try to seem invisible. Another mannerism as a result of growing up in a narcissistic home with a narcissistic parent is selective mutism in groups. Adults who grew up with narcissistic parents occasionally choose not to speak at all in group settings, especially when topics of personal importance are discussed due to the fear of criticism or belittlement that they experienced in their family growing up. I remember when I did groups, therapy groups for many, many years, codependent therapy groups, addiction therapy groups, mental health, family therapy groups, and on. I remember when I did groups, therapy groups for many, many years, family groups for those who had family members who were having mental illness issues, and that there was a lot of resistance for many people to come and be a part of a group because they just felt too anxious, too nervous. They couldn't talk. They feared judgment.",

My answer is I don't want to read Adults who grew up with narcissistic parents struggle to establish personal limits timely or effectively. A consequence of growing up where personal boundaries were either not respected or not recognized. And again, I think that's what's important is our boundaries are not timely. And then when we do have boundaries or we do choose boundaries, they're not effective because we don't have the confidence or the solid sense of self to make them effective. And again, any of us can make our boundaries effective. I didn't say any of us could change other people and make them do what we want them to do. But even if I choose to make a boundary and someone doesn't keep it. , then we won't be communicating much anymore. That's me making my boundary effective. And again, they may not want to change, but I can have effective boundaries. I just need to know what are the consequences are going to be if they don't follow them. Another weird mannerism that we have growing up in a family with a narcissistic parent is getting easily reactive. Adults who grew up with narcissistic parents. Demonstrate a heightened emotional response to minor provocations rooted in a hypersensitivity developed from having navigating and maneuvering in a volatile home environment. If you've always got something going on, if you're living in a household of drama, if you're living in a household of rollercoaster emotionally. Then it's easy for us to live in a situation where we're not able to do anything. And that's where I think it's important to begin to get a number of these things out of us. And for us to become us, not what the family shaped in us. And I'm going to talk about that a little more at the end of the video here. Another weird mannerism that an adult child of a narcissist may have is feeling small or inflated.",

    "output": "Adults who grew up with narcissistic parents may experience feelings of insignificance or exaggerated self-importance as a coping or defensive mechanism against the erratic affirmations and criticisms from their parent. I certainly think a lot of us can probably identify with the feelings of insignificance. , I'm just not important. Why would anyone care about me. My voice doesn't mean anything. My opinions. My opinions don't matter. Now, what about this exaggerated self-importance. I remember having a boss that I worked for in a hospital. And she grew up in an alcoholic, narcissistic home. And she would go around with exaggerated self-importance that wasn't based on anything. It didn't have any substance to it. And if you challenged it. She would just crumble. But she would have this exaggerated self-importance. And I think of it as kind of whistling past the cemetery. That I'm really afraid, but I'm going to whistle , oh, there's nothing wrong. There's nothing going on. And she would manage that. And of course it would irritate other people. But if you dare challenge it, she just folds. Or becomes vindictive. Because of how she would manage. Because of how she was abused growing up. Another weird mannerism that adult children of narcissists can have. Is never operating from their true self. Adults who grew up with narcissistic parents may struggle to identify or operate from their true self. As they often do not have a clear understanding of what it means. Their sense of identity may be overshadowed or suppressed. By the need to conform. And conform to parental expectations and demands. And then as we become an adult. Conform to the expectations and demands of others around us. Leaving them unsure of their own desires, benefits, and values. You may have some or all of these mannerisms. The good news is that there are fixes and recovery for all of them. Let me give you some self differentiation tips. First of all, remember these mannerisms are not the real you. Don't forget that. They are what you have been programmed to have. They're the family Wi-Fi. They come from all of the experiences growing up in a narcissistic home. Second of all, learn to detach from the family super self. In other words. A family that's dysfunctional has one big super self. That everybody partakes of. They don't have selves.",

And they're mine. They may be my family. But I'm not just absorbing them or having been programmed. And that's just what I believe. we want to learn to detach from the family super self. Thirdly. Ask yourself. What are the downsides of letting go of some or all of these mannerisms. And becoming your true self. For example. Let's talk about easily reactive. If you worked on being calm. And chose not to be reactive to those around you. What would be the downsides for you. You might say. I know what the upsides would be. I'd feel calmer. I'd feel more a solid sense of self. No, no. What are the downsides. And then many of us as adult children would say. if I'm not reactive. Then someone doesn't know I'm upset. Or they need to know they're wrong. I need to be reactive. But actually. What is the purpose of that. You think that will make them be clearer about being wrong. Probably not. And you're just now off your square and reactive. And they're just getting reactive to your reactivity. And it goes back and forth. And I think there are downsides to letting go of these mannerisms that are problematic. If I see myself as invisible.

    "output": "If you were the scapegoat in your family, you were never the problem, but you were treated you were, because someone had to carry the weight no one else would face. And when you finally step out of the scapegoat role, everything starts to change. Not because you are causing a problem, but because your absence exposes the family problems. In this video, I want to walk you through what really happens when narcissistic parents lose you as their scapegoat. But first, let's be clear about what the scapegoat role actually is. The scapegoat is cast to be seen as the problem one in the family. Often they can be seen as the problem maker, the troublemaker, both being seen that way inside the family and outside the family. Because they are the problem one. Because the family roles will be broadcast to extended family and even to some of the community around us. The scapegoat is not the problem. And they are not the problem in the family. They are where the family places the problem. They carry the anxiety, the anger, the shame, and the dysfunction. the rest of the system doesn't have to face it. The scapegoat is the one who may refuse either consciously or unconsciously. To fuse with the family's dysfunction. They don't play along. Or the family may only interact with the scapegoat if they continue to accept the abuse. And in a narcissistic or enmeshed system, this refusal gets punished. They are often the most emotionally honest person in the family, the scapegoat. But honestly, threatens a system built on denial, control, and bullying. The scapegoat becomes the target. The identified problem. They become the one who is too sensitive, too angry, too over serious, too difficult, too problematic. Not because they are. But because the family needs them to be. what happens when the scapegoat steps away. First of all, when the narcissistic parents lose the scapegoat, the system destabilizes. The system destabilizes. Changing a part changes the system. When you show up differently, you brand yourself a non-scapegoat. It throws the narcissist and the family system off. I remember talking to Jose, fake name, threw his family off when he responded in a non-plussed way. All of the siblings would get together but just not invite him. If mentioned, they would say, , of course you're.",

    "input": "I'm struggling with guilt. Can you help me understand what's happening?",
    "output": "But it would not be long, they would do it again and again and not invite him and not include him. He was the family scapegoat. he began to say to them, , I hear you're having a get together. I do hope you have a good time. And he would say this without reactivity, upsetness, or guile. This tended to throw them off because he was acknowledging what was actually happening, but also maintain some inner boundaries of detachment that I can't change you. I'm not going to shame you or guilt you for not inviting me. And again, the positive part is it really is their loss, not his. It would be great to be apart. But if they're not wanting him to be there, then do I want to be where I'm not wanted to be. Number two, when narcissistic parents lose the scapegoat, they panic emotionally. Narcissistic parents have to readjust. They have anger, criticism, and they have all of these things that they need to project. And they wonder where it should be directed. Once you step out of the scapegoat role, it frustrates the narcissist because where am I going to put this. Stepping out of the scapegoat role at least requires strengthening your inner boundaries. Whenever I say inner boundaries, think emotional detachment. These are the things that I'm going to talk about. These are the I don't care muscles and the it doesn't matter muscles. And I think we want to exercise those more and more that we are nonplussed, nonreactive, that we can be with them being not. Number three, when narcissistic parents lose the scapegoat, they escalate with resistance. When they sense or see that the scapegoat is slipping away, the narcissistic parent gets reactive, often escalating to the three stages of resistance in families. Stage one, why are you doing this, Mary. Why are you doing this, Jose. And what's wrong. Stage two, why don't you change back. Or how about you stop doing what you're doing. Stage three resistance is, stop what you're resisting. Stop what you were doing or else. And those are the typical three stages of resistance that if we can maintain our self differentiation, it does create a change in the system. It doesn't make a narcissist not a narcissist.",

    "output": "While the golden child may hold on to their role in the family, others may start to become targets for nitpicking or criticism. They then begin to audition for the opening in the scapegoat role. Number eight, when narcissistic parents lose the scapegoat, they feel exposed. Narcissistic parents lose their foil or their sleight of hand or look over here focus, which is a very important part of the family. This is exactly what a scapegoat is all about. Look over here you don't look over here. I know for many years I worked with alcoholics and addicts. Those are horrible diseases, and they're very difficult to treat and very difficult at times to get over and to find recovery. And that often the alcoholic or addict wants a scapegoat in the family that everyone will look over there at the problem child. They're having trouble at school. They're shoplifting. Now we know where the problem is, but nobody asks the child, is your father an alcoholic. Yes, he is. And that could be the reasons why they're acting out. Not the acting out is a problem, but the reason the deeper problem is not being addressed. They feel vulnerable if they don't have a place to project their negative or shadow side. And we need to project that shadow side somewhere. And that's what the scapegoat is for. Number nine, when narcissistic parents lose the scapegoat, they lose emotional control of you. The scapegoat role protects the dysfunctional parent from you being a loose cannon, sharing family secrets, a catalyst with which they could experience shame. And this is triggering for a narcissist. And if a scapegoat is out of pocket, that can really shake a narcissistic parent. Number 10, when a parent is a narcissist, they lose emotional control of you. When a parent is a narcissist, they lose emotional control of him or her. And this is triggering for a narcissist. the secret is there needs to be more amassment to drinking with this kind of pain.

Mary worked very hard to detach internally and giving up her feelings of guilt and shame. She differentiated from the family narrative about her. In other words, that's them, not me. Her mother said, I can't take your attitude and hurtful behavior. my heart isn't good. Her mother ended up in the hospital. All the family blamed who. Mary.

    "output": "You think narcissists mellow out with age. Not quite. In fact, many grow worse. Much worse. See, we to assume that age naturally brings wisdom, that as people grow older they become more self-aware, more humbled by life's trials. But narcissism doesn't follow that arc. It doesn't bend toward insight. It calcifies. It ossifies. And eventually, it begins to rot from the inside. Narcissism is not just arrogance or vanity. It's not simply a preference for admiration or a little too much pride in one's appearance. At its core, narcissism is a psychological defense, a fortress built to protect a profoundly fragile sense of self. It's a mask, carefully crafted and rigidly maintained. Because what lies beneath is often unbearable. Shame. Emptiness. Inferiority. And as time marches forward, mercilessly stripping away the tools that once propped that mask up, what's left is not liberation, but desperation. The charming smile becomes brittle. The persuasive voice grows bitter. And the once captive audience walks away, leaving the narcissist shouting into silence. They don't grow out of it. Inferiority. In fact, many grow deeper into it. Because to face the truth now, to finally admit that the persona was a lie, would mean confronting a lifetime of deception. Most simply can't do it. they double down. They cling tighter. And in doing , they spiral. Today I want to walk you through some painfully clear signs that narcissists don't age. And that in many cases they descend into chaos, not peace. Not all grow old gracefully. Some grow dangerous. And the signs are there if you're willing to see them. Number one, increased isolation. One of the most telling signs that a narcissist is worsening with age is their increasing isolation, not just physical, but psychological. And it's not the kind of solitude chosen for peace or reflection. It's the kind that results from erosion, of trust, of relationships, of goodwill. You see, as a narcissist grows older, their influence begins to wane. And as a narcissist grows older, their influence begins to wane. And as a narcissist grows older, their influence begins to wane. And as a narcissist grows older, their influence begins to wane. Their social capital, the charm, the charisma, the magnetic pull they once held over others, fades. And what remains is often unpleasant. People begin to see through the mask. Now narcissists are not stupid.",

    "output": "They are often keenly attuned to social cues. But here's the paradox. They don't adapt. They don't evolve. Why. Because doing would mean admitting they were wrong. It would mean re-examining the grandiose image they've crafted. And it would mean re-examining the grandiose image they've crafted. And it would mean re-examining the grandiose image they've crafted. And that, to them, is tantamount to death. rather than facing the discomfort of change, they choose to blame others. They accuse. They lash out. And eventually they retreat. They burn bridges at an alarming rate. Friends who once admired them now feel manipulated. Family members grow tired of walking on eggshells. Colleagues lose respect. It's not just that people leave the narcissist. It's that the narcissist pushes them to the limit. And that's why they're scared. They're scared. They're scared. They're scared. They're scared. They're scared. They're scared. They're scared. And often without realizing it, they perceive abandonment where there is accountability. They interpret disagreement as betrayal. they isolate, not out of necessity, but out of delusion. And here's where it turns tragic. The narcissist will tell themselves they've outgrown everyone else. That others were jealous, disloyal, or ungrateful. But deep down, somewhere behind the bravado, they know. They know they're alone. They know the calls stopped coming. They know they're alone. They know they're alone. They know they're alone. coming. They know they're no longer invited. And that truth gnaws at them. What we're witnessing in this stage is not just isolation, it's exile. Self-imposed exile disguised as superiority. And the older they get, the smaller their world becomes. Not because life has cruelly taken it away, but because they burned it down themselves. And they'll never admit it. Because to admit it would mean the mask wasn't real. And if the mask wasn't real, then who exactly are they. That question is too terrifying for most narcissists to answer. they remain alone, angry, confused. But most of all, untouched by the very intimacy they once craved. Number 2. Obsession with the past. Another unmistakable sign that a narcissist is deteriorating with age is their fixation on the past, more specifically on their own past. You'll hear it constantly. Back when I was respected, people used to admire me, or you should've seen how important I was. It's a steady drumbeat of nostalgia, but it's not the kind that warms the soul.",

    "output": "It's desperate. It's distorted. It's weaponized. You see for most people, reflecting on the past can bring clarity. Gratitude, even wisdom. But for the aging narcissist, it becomes a hiding place. The present is unbearable. The future is frightening. they take refuge in a story. A carefully curated narrative of who they once were. Only the highlights, of course. Only the moments that fed the grand illusion of their own greatness. The danger is, these stories grow in magnitude as their relevance shrinks. The tales become taller. The achievements become more dramatic. The audience becomes more adoring. But all in memory, not reality. And here's the psychological trap. The more they obsess over the past, the more disconnected they become from the present. They're not telling these stories to connect. They're telling them to connect. They're telling them to connect. They're telling them to connect. They're telling them to connect. They're telling them to connect. They're telling them to survive. It's a form of self-preservation. If they can convince you that they were once powerful, maybe they can convince themselves that they still are. But beneath the inflated stories lies a deep sense of decay. The narcissist's identity is anchored in external validation. And as those sources dry up, the only place left to mine is the past. They don't realize that constantly reminding others of their glory days doesn't inspire it repels. It reveals. It reveals the void in their current self-concept. It exposes the fact that they haven't built anything meaningful since those moments they keep reliving. And the people around them notice. They begin to tune out. Not because the stories are old, but because they feel hollow. echoes in a chamber of insecurity. And the narcissist, sensing this, tells them louder. More often. With greater urgency. Because the mask is slipping. The cracks are widening. And in their mind, the mask is slipping. And the mask is slipping. And the cracks are widening. And in their mind, the mask is slipping. And the cracks are widening. And in their mind, the mask is slipping. And in their mind, the mask is slipping. While they think their past is deemed never to be.

As narcissists age and the world stops revolving around them, another insidious shift begins to take place. They descend deeper into the role of the victim. Because they damaged something, they shared it with their loved ones. Instead of simply And it's not the honest suffering of someone facing genuine hardship. No, it's a strategic, corrosive kind of victimhood. One that turns every misfortune into a personal attack, every inconvenience into a grand betrayal. You see, when a narcissist can no longer command admiration through dominance or charm, they pivot. And the most effective way to reclaim emotional leverage, especially as age strips them of other tools, is through pity. They weaponize sympathy. Illness, financial struggles, family estrangement. These become tools, not trials. Not opportunities for growth, but performances designed to draw in concern, and more importantly, control. Now this isn't to say that aging doesn't come with suffering. Of course it does. But in the narcissist's mind, suffering is never just circumstantial. It's personal. Why is this happening to me. They ask, not from a place of existential reflection, but from entitlement. From the belief that they've been uniquely wronged by the universe, or by you. And here's where it darkens, the narrative grows more paranoid. They begin to suspect others of scheming against them. Relatives. Friends. Even strangers. Any boundary becomes an offense. Any disagreement becomes betrayal. They reframe the entire story of their life, through a lens of injustice. I gave everything. And look how I was treated. It's a martyrdom. A martyr complex. But not the noble kind. It's manipulation disguised as woundedness. This bitter victimhood isolates them further. People begin to see the pattern. Conversations become emotionally exhausting. Every interaction is laced with guilt or grievance. Eventually, those around them grow silent, or walk away entirely. And what remains. A narcissist sitting alone, repeating a story that only they believe. A story in which they were always the same. A story in which they were always the hero, then the victim, but never the cause. That's the crux of it. Narcissists age poorly because they cannot accept responsibility. They would rather be victims of a cruel world than confront the role they played in building their own misery. It's not just sad, it's dangerous.",

    "output": "But the truth is simpler and far more painful. When charm runs out, control reveals what was always underneath. And what was underneath, was not. It was the narcissist. It was never love. It was never connection. It was leverage. And the tragedy. They don't even realize what they've lost. Because control might win compliance. But it never earns respect. And it certainly doesn't create love. It only builds walls around the narcissist, and within them, until they're left alone, with nothing left to dominate but their own echo. Number 5. Obsessive need for validation. As the narcissist grows older, one would hope that the incessant need for acceptance, the incessant need for external validation, this hunger to be admired, to be praised, would fade. Or at least soften. That with time, they would turn inward, and find something resembling substance. Something stable. But that's not what happens. In many cases, quite the opposite occurs. The need for attention doesn't diminish. It intensifies. And it does with a desperation that's both tragic and deeply unsettling. You see, the narcissist doesn't know who they are without a reason. They don't know who they are without an audience. Their identity was never forged through discipline or introspection. It was constructed through applause. Through the reflections they saw in the eyes of others. From the earliest days, their entire sense of self was built not by asking, Who am I. But how do others see me. And for a time, that can work. In youth, with energy, beauty, status, validation flows freely. People are drawn to charm. Success. Wit. But age is the great equalizer. Time strips away the superficial. And what's left is the raw, often hollow core. When this happens, the narcissist doesn't let go of the performance. They cling to it. They become obsessive. Validation becomes a kind of drug. And any addiction, the dosage must increase as the effects decrease. Social media becomes their stage. They post incessantly. They dramatize their life. They overshare. Every photo, every image. Every photo. Every comment. Every is another hit of artificial self-worth. It's not authenticity. It's performance. And they need it to feel real. And here's where it grows more pathological. Even negative attention becomes fuel. If they can't be loved, they'll settle for being envied. If not envied, then feared. If not feared, at least noticed.",

    "output": "Achievements stall. They live for the mirror, and the mirror eventually cracks. And what's left is a person endlessly chasing affirmation in a world that no longer echoes back. This is one of the great tragedies of unchecked narcissism in later life. Because attention is fleeting. But identity, true identity, must be rooted in something deeper. Something earned. And if you spend your whole life performing, you'll reach the final act with no one left in the audience, and nothing left inside. if you're watching this and recognizing these patterns, either in someone else or god forbid in yourself, it's not too late. But you have to ask the hard question. If no one is watching, who am I really. Because only then, only when you stop chasing applause and start facing yourself, can you begin to live with truth. And that's the only validation that ever mattered. Number 6. Increased rage and resentment. One of the most alarming signs that a narcissist is worsening with age is the rise in unfiltered rage and deep-seated resentment. This isn't just occasional frustration or irritability. Those are normal parts of aging. No. This is something much darker. It's what happens when narcissism left unchecked for decades begins to curdle. It turns bitter. Toxic. Explosive. You see, when a narcissist is young and still relatively powerful, when they can command attention, sway others with charm, and manipulate subtly, they don't need to show you their rage. The performance is still working. The illusion is still intact. People are still clapping. But over time, as their tools weaken, when the beauty fades, the energy wanes, and the charm no longer hypnotizes, what's left is the raw, festering resentment of someone who's not even there. And that's what I'm talking about. The world is now in a state of resentment of someone who has always needed the world to bow, and now watches it walk away. This is the psychological breaking point. Because narcissists never believed they were simply part of the world. They believed they deserved to dominate it. And when that domination becomes impossible, the mask comes off. The fury comes out. Rage, for the aging narcissist, becomes a default response to reality. They are furious that people don't admire them anymore. Furious that others have surpassed them. Furious that the world dares to evolve without them at the center.",

    "output": "The aging narcissist becomes a prisoner of their own bitterness. They don't laugh they used to. They don't hope. They don't plan. Instead, they ruminate. They stew. They spend hours, even days, replaying perceived injustices, building elaborate mental courtrooms where they're always the victim, always the hero, and always justified in their fury. And perhaps the saddest part. They think this is strength. They think being angry makes them powerful. But it's not strength. It's fear. Fear that they're no longer relevant. Fear that they were never as loved as they believed. Fear that, deep down, they're not the same. Fear that they're not the same. Fear that they're not the same. Fear that they're not the same. Fear that they're not the same. Fear that they're not the same. They never built anything real, only a mirror, and now even that is cracked. This level of resentment doesn't just destroy relationships, it eats away at the soul. You can see it in their posture, in their eyes, in the way they speak. The light is gone. The joy is gone. All that remains is the hollow echo of a person who cannot accept that the world has moved on without them. if you're close to someone this, recognize the signs, not to hate them, but to protect yourself. And maybe, just maybe, to understand that their rage isn't power. It's a cry of existential panic. The terrifying realization that the mask is slipping, and they don't know who they are without it. And if you see some part of this in yourself, stop. Because the good news is, bitterness is not a life sentence, but it is a warning. A signal that it's time to confront the truth, no matter how painful, because until you face what you've become, you cannot become anything else. 7. Self-destruction or collapse. Eventually, there comes a point, often quietly, sometimes catastrophically, where the entire structure begins to implode. This is the final act in the narcissist's aging process. Self-destruction or collapse. The very persona they spent a lifetime constructing, this elaborate, inflated, carefully curated mask, becomes too heavy to bear. And when that mask slips, it doesn't just reveal the truth beneath. It's a mask that's not just a mask, it's a mask that's not just a mask. It's a mask that's not just a mask.",

It doesn't grow softer or more tempered with experience. Instead it rots. It corrodes the soul from the inside out. Especially when it's not there. Especially when no real self ever existed beneath the mask. The mask, you understand, is a fragile thing. Eid, it's a carefully constructed illusion. A fortress built on insecurity, fear, and denial. And over time, when life's inevitable hardships strip away the external validations, the looks, the status, the power, that mask begins to crumble. What remains is not strength, but vulnerability. Not growth, but decay. The narcissist's world collapses because it was never built on truth. It was built on falsades. And the longer they cling to those falsades, the more devastating the fall becomes. This is not just a decline. It is a unraveling. And yet, here's the critical point. If you love someone this, if you see these signs in someone close to you, understand this decay isn't your fault. It's not a punishment you must bear, or a failing you caused. You're not alone. You're not alone. You are a psychological wound. A sickness of the spirit that can isolate and devastate those around it as much as the person who carries it. But knowledge is power. Seeing the signs. The isolation. The obsession with the past. The victimhood. The rage. The collapse. Means you're no longer blind to the truth. You're equipped to protect yourself. To set boundaries and to seek healing where healing is possible. And for the narcissists themselves. If they are willing to look inward. It is never too late to begin the difficult work of self-examination and transformation. But that requires courage, humility and a willingness to face a truth that most find unbearable, that the mask must fall for the real self to emerge. recognize the unraveling but do not despair, because from truth comes the possibility of redemption. And without truth, there is only endless decay.",

terrified of my husband when he rages i don't think it's best for me to remain but i'm wondering if i should wait until they are older or grown to leave this is this is this here is the question of all survivors who are in a situation this rageful narcissist likely not a good parent child is scared of them but then there is that big thing called family court and the one thing the narcissistic person knows is how to punish you now once they figure out that messing with custody is going to destroy your soul they're going all in and most judges in this country will award 50 to the other parent if they ask for it which is a lot of time spent away from the parent who's the healthier parent and this is what people going to do is they're going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who grapple with and here's what's challenging mel this is one of those cases where i'm not going to be able to give a good answer because you're at the crossroads where you either get the divorce deal with the custody set up know that there's times your child is alone with that parent that they're scared of or you stick it out some parents get solace from knowing their presence at least they can run interference for that child with this toxic parent they might wait until the child they feels more able to sort of autonomously make needs known there is no answer here some of this is going to come down to money are you going to be able to secure housing for you and your child and your children the way you want getting access to mental health for that child while before you ever make a decision on a divorce is crucial because i can promise you this once that marriage splits and you don't make a divorce that's not your decision that's your child's decision and you don't make the proper stipulations in the parenting agreement that parent will stop therapy i see this happen over and over again they insist on two-party consent for things mental health services and then the narcissistic parent won't sign it's back to court back to court back to court get that child into therapy while you only need the signature of one parent because you're both still married get your ducks in line talk to a divorce attorney pay whatever they charge for an hour go in there prepared tax returns whatever you need and ask them what am i looking at what are the laws of this state because they're different in every state what am i looking at with custody what am i looking at with money i think the problem is that too many people don't go into this conversation prepared marriage is a legal contract make no mistake people read their rental car contracts more carefully than they understand exactly what the hell they're getting into when they marry someone and figure this out even if you're not going to get divorced for 10 years getting that clear feedback from a divorce attorney makes a huge difference in your decision making when i read a message this is the first time somebody vocalizes that they're considering leaving i know that they're on their way out it may take five years it may take eight years they might even wait till that child's 18th birthday which i cannot tell you how many people i know waited till midnight on their child's 18th birthday and then they started the process by that next day they had filed for divorce no custody i have to be honest with you i really wish you were going to say get out now no because never i know i'm just being honest because i you want a clear-cut i know answer there's not one there's not the systems don't allow it now family court is one of the most abusive systems in this country there are people involved in court reform the stuff they bring to me i'm thinking this is not in the best interest of the child if you get unlucky with the judge you're screwed and also i think all of us have some friend or family member that is not a good friend or family member and i think that's what i'm trying to get at i'm trying to get at that but i think that's what i'm trying to get at i'm trying to get at that and i think that's what i'm trying to get at i'm trying to get at that and i think that's what i'm trying to get at watching a divorce play out a decade later constantly going back into court because it's a way for somebody with a narcissistic personality style punishing to continue punishing and being in control it's called post-separation abuse it's a formal thing post-separation they keep going and going and going but i will say this and something i tell many parents a mistake they make i think too many people are i'm gonna fight for my child no matter what and the narcissistic person grabs on to that and oh is that your weak point but if you i remember once coaching a woman and she wanted to play this whole mother lioness thing i'm slow it down and instead when she was at they were having one of these many hearings they'd go through she said i'm i this and she was dying inside at the agreement that was coming down the pike and she said that's great what actually these alternate weekends this is going to work great for me because there are many friends and i'm going to fight for my child and i'm going to fight for my child and i'm going to fight for my child and i'm going to fight for my child and i'm going to fight for my child i've been wanting to connect with and i've been i've been wanting to get back into some of this the hiking and climbing i was doing this is actually i'm going to really use the weekends that fool he's what no don't think you're just gonna no no wait and when she when it got framed as that's she was totally cool at it she said totally fine get it i'm actually this is great i mean it's good to know this because i've been wanting to do this stuff and pursue this and i'll be using that time and i'm sure the kids can break up over time and what's the point the kids will love spending time with you and by the time the whole thing was done

narcissistic people is akin to hugging a porcupine it's really a bad idea and it's a fool's errand i'm tired of people giving guidance to people set boundaries wait why aren't we supposed to not with narcissists you set them with everybody else but this is a pointless endeavor and all it does is it's a pointless endeavor and all it does is it's a pointless endeavor and all it does is it's a pointless endeavor and all it does is create more friction in this create more friction in this kind of drama this person's having kind of drama this person's having with their mother who is silent treatmenting and being sullen and all these other things with their mother who is silent treatmenting and being sullen and all these other things when this idea of setting boundaries with a narcissistic person i always say it's an inside job and where you're there if you say to them i don't want you to talk about this i don't want you to come this you are basically inviting them to do that thing because they know they can mess with you all unless you want to spend the remainder of your time on this planet getting unless you want to spend the remainder of your time on this planet getting into a power struggle with them which i just said you cannot win your better bet is to set an internal boundary which is i now know that these topics are off limits i know that if i invite this person to this event this is going to happen i'm going to have to figure out an alternative i know if i make a reservation with them for dinner they're going to show up 25 minutes late i need to make a reservation at that place that seats us when we're not yet a complete party some people say you're enabling the narcissist you're actually not because there's no setting a boundary with them and you want to have the dinner and you may have to invite them but at least y'all can start eating and when they come in and say how dare you start with us we said that we said to come at seven you didn't come at seven they seated us we started eating you set a boundary i love that distinction because you're when you say i'm going to set a boundary with somebody who's narcissistic it implies that you're going to tell them about it versus you're just saying just understand the situation for what it is understand the person is not changing recognize the patterns and set sort of this boundary with yourself for me the one that i have in my life with a particular person is it's a three-night limit that's because exactly by day four this person gets prickly you mel you would never say to that person we have a three-night limit no oh my god but that would be this that what a lot of people say if a person is saying things that offend you need to say that thing you're saying is offending me tiger's cage try that with the narcissist call me up let me know how that works and i also don't set the boundaries that are i don't talk about politics with you because you're an absolutely irrational freak that then dominates the conversation if anybody asks a question or tries to offer a different point of view i set a boundary with myself i get up from the table i don't engage that's that you don't engage because i know exactly what's about to happen i have no hope of it being different i have accepted it i set the boundary i don't engage in this stuff i remove myself that's a boundary not what this poor person unfortunately is trying to do the impossible with the mother and will be forever disappointed because if you go mom let's not talk about why you don't want to talk about politics because that we all know how that goes got it internal boundaries only i say boundaries are an inside game i love that oh my child is a narcissist teenager how can i help them let's first of all let's always slow our roll when we're using the word narcissism and teenager by definition adolescence is a phase of life where the child is going through something called separation and individuation adolescents are tough they are mean to their parents and often quite lovely with their peers and there's a reason for that the separation individuation process means that the peers are more of a meaningful social reference point they'll actually be lovely with their peers listen to their problems pick them up late at night bring them soup when they're sick and scream at you who even dare mention emptying the dishwasher and there's a there's a common sort of therapist talk is that an adolescent is often going through a phase we call shitting the nest shitting the shitting the nest and if they ship the nest and it's a lot easier for everyone to say get out and for the kid to leave this is gross I don't want to be here all that mean behavior is sometimes part and parcel of shitting the nest we have to be able to figure out if it's that narcissism is a story that can be told beautifully backwards but it's very difficult to tell forwards and in real time with an adolescent for example what I mean is show me a 35 year old narcissist and I will show you someone who was horrible as a teenager show me someone who is horrible as a teenager I don't know if they're good at this I don't know if they're good at this I don't know if they're going to be narcissistic when they're 35 really the frontal lobes are continuing to develop a lot of that kind of lack of social awareness impulsivity all that sitting up here that part does not fully cement and set until around 25 26 27 years old adolescents really if you want to look at it developmentally doesn't matter that they can drive and vote and buy alcohol it really is it goes until about 25 26 that's when adulthood starts I'd say to people of narcissistic adolescents white-knuckle white-knuckle this a bit have whatever limits you need in your household be realistic about them remember the concept of shitting the nest and put a pin in it for about eight years and then revisit let's just kind of unpack this a little bit because I'm sure there's a ton of you that are listening now that are whoa whoa whoa but what if I am seeing narcissistic traits because one of the things that you have let me just stop there because you just said you probably are what you're saying is that the very natural normal and mentally healthy process of a teenager separating from their parents is for them to become more egotistical correct more demonstrative more selfish and to prioritize old entitled however if you are seeing that and you are concerned and maybe you're concerned because you're in a family system where grandparents are narcissistic or you have an ex who is narcissistic you do have some concern is there something that you can model that helps to keep somebody on a adaptive personality track versus spinning into more of a maladaptive or are you basically saying there's really not much you can do but white-knuckle yourself or you want to be sure yes figure out how your kids are behaving with their peers because if they have healthy peer relationships that seem reciprocal that seem mutual that they that the can use everything to change the outras whether and d'accord d'accord je Rhonda cool perfect Zack we are pretty much there you can take that and Cal Cont guess they're able you really should take a look at life and their lives and by naturally convinced to be more of a

But the likelihood is if you're both willing to come to the table. And he in particular is willing to do the work. Then the odds are in your favor. And you will come through this stronger. the story I want you to tell yourself is this. What if. He did this because it was the only way he could stay in the marriage. Because he was feeling lost. And depressed. And whatever. That he. Was the one who didn't feel good enough. And it's not about you or the other person being thin or whatever else. That he was at a point in his life that he lost who he was. And he might as have been having sex with a frickin dinner plate for crying out loud. Because it's not about the other person. It's about him chasing an old version of himself. And if there's a dynamic in your relationship where he thinks he's failing or he thinks he's not good enough. That's what this is about. It's not about you not being good enough about him not measuring up for you. , I that story a lot better. And what else I a lot better that it was sex or an emotional connection and not heroin. I don't know. I'd kind of prefer the heroin I think. now you would. Because we want to make this stuff about us. Of course it hurts you. Of course. It's devastating. And one of the biggest things you will learn from this if you allow yourself to. Is you'll learn that forgiveness only happens when you stop wishing things were different.

And you already know that they said that, but they're about to land it. And no, there is another new angle to just restate what they already stated. It's uncomfortable as a listener. It's difficult to communicate with somebody this. And it clearly shows that the person isn't confident and is uncomfortable. instead of over explaining, or softening your feedback be direct more than that, seeking validation. instantly erode your authority. And high-level CEOs actually get authority because they are direct and they are deliberate. be a confident CEO. They don't need validation and neither do you. And another hack on this is watch really successful people communicate. I didn't say listen to how they communicate. I said watch how they communicate. You'll notice that they don't talk this. This is not the way that somebody who is successful communicates. They sit up straight. Their shoulders are back. They have confidence through their body language. They move their hands through this certain little section of their bodies here. They don't sit there and fidget, playing with their fingers, playing with their rings, moving their feet around. They're able to sit there comfortably, have a direct conversation, eye to eye with another human being. it is very simple to just throw your shoulders back, sit up a little taller, and look you are more confident before you actually become more confident. One of the things that I had to work on for a while. The way you project your voice also matters. And this was actually something I had to work on for quite some time. I tended to whisper. For a very clear reason, I used to get quieter when I would voice my opinion. And that reason is pretty obvious. I wasn't certain of my opinion. I didn't feel I could present my idea and be passionate and be excited because I was actually uncertain. And you could tell not just by the words I was saying, but by the volume that I was using to portray. I had to actively work on not talking this and trying to quiet myself, but by being louder and being more communicative through my body language, but also through the volume, which I was speaking.",

    "output": "let me give you 16 possible things that motivate or are underneath why we sabotage. the first for many people in recovery is guilt. Deep down, they have never forgiven themselves for what they've done. Some of the terrible things they've done to hurt others. And they don't truly deep down believe that they deserve a good life. And whenever good things start to happen, their guilt says you don't deserve this. You should be punishing yourself. And they sabotage. And then shame, deep shame, which believes I'm not good enough. Once they start to grow and get. healthy relationships and get a good stuff happening, they go, that's not the real me. I'm a fraud. I'm an imposter. I need to make my circumstances match how I see myself, which is a failure. That way I won't be a fraud. shame can play a part. Then for many children growing up in complex trauma, whenever good things happen, they go, when good things were happening in the family and there was a time of peace and it looked somewhat happiness, something bad always happened. The other shoe always dropped. Dad came home drunk, angry, and all broke loose. And they began to experience that as a pattern in their life. When things go smoothly, the other shoe is going to drop very soon. Something bad is going to happen. And now they carry that belief subconsciously into adult life. And when things are going smoothly, their brain is saying, -oh, the other shoe is about to drop, let's just make it happen. Let's get it over with. And they sabotage the good stuff. Third, you can take that to the relationships and what we refer to as the cycle of violence. in a violent, ongoing relationship, you have the outburst of violence. And in the early days, that is followed by a time of a honeymoon where everybody wants to make up for hurting each other, being angry at each other, and they're on their best behavior. They're very super sweet to each other. But they don't deal with any problems that come up because they're afraid if they point out the problems, it'll take the honeymoon away. they just stuff everything down, which means pressure starts building. And as pressure builds, it finally gets to a point where there's another outburst. And that's the cycle.",

    "output": "we've been looking at the 60 characteristics of complex trauma. Today we're coming to one that might seem very innocent, it's no big deal. But it's a big deal for people from complex trauma. And it's the tendency to be negative and critical. what I want to say up front is being negative and critical is both an attitude and an action. It's a mindset that people from complex trauma develop where they choose, often without realizing that they're choosing it, but they're choosing to find fault with stuff. They're choosing to look for negative. And I want to start with just kind of giving you a definition, a better understanding of what I am talking about. Here's the definition. It's a common but very dangerous headspace for those with C, PTSD, or complex trauma. They are marked by an overall discontent and find fault with just about everything. let me give you some examples of how this would work out in people's life. somebody with kind of a negative orientation, a negative critical headspace, is somebody that tends to complain a lot. And they might do it in joking ways, sarcastic ways, but complaining is a common thing. Or they blame others a lot for their problems, for their discontent. When they meet people, they look for a flaw. And they are very commonly known for criticizing people, pointing out their flaws. Many will have a victim mentality. it's, oh, my life is awful, poor me, and just dwell on all of the negatives in their life. Others, when they're in a situation that's new or different, or they feel uncomfortable, they jump to the worst case scenario. And they go to, this is all terrible, and it's a very negative thing. Others dwell on bad news. All the time they just focus on all the bad news in the media, social media, and the internet. And they're not even aware of the bad news. And they're not even aware of the bad news in the media, social media, from reports from friends, etc. Think of a person who's in a hurry,. And nobody is cooperating. you are driving somewhere, and you're in a hurry to get there, but nobody is making that easy for you. what do you do as you're driving.

You can't get to a place of safety. And what the brain is doing is saying, I got to find a way to protect this child. what can I do to keep this child safe. Number one, I will look for danger in every situation I enter. now I will train that person to look for potential problems, to look for potential harm.",

    "output": "That will fix my shame. , they try to be perfect. But what happens. Nobody can be perfect. , instead of improving their shame, improving their sense of not having enough value, trying to be perfect actually reinforces it and creates a greater negative critic. Because now you focus on everything. Every time you fail to be perfect. And that becomes your obsession. And you make that a constant thing in your mind. Another purpose that this being negative fills, is the child who's neglected, abused and abandoned has many needs that aren't being met. But they have learned that if you go and ask people to meet those needs, it's likely they're not going to. They're going to reject you. Or they're going to punish you. They're going to call you selfish. , the only way to get your needs met is you can only trust yourself. , you have to manipulate. And , one of the tools for manipulating is when I meet a person, I want to find out something really bad about them that I can use as leverage against them. That I can threaten them that I will expose this area of their life unless they do what I want. And , now I am looking for flaws in people. I am looking for the dirt on people more negative. Then for people who remain in a victim mentality. Where they go to a place where they go, I don't want to choose to change. I just want people to feel sorry for me. And , what happens in that person's mind in order to reinforce this, is that they're going to be more negative. And , when they're going to reinforce this victim mentality and getting others to feel sorry for them, they have to blame everybody, everything for their problems. They never take ownership for their problems. It's always somebody else's fault. And that's another type of negative orientation. One of the things with complex trauma is a tremendous fear of failure. And , what happens for a lot of people. When they go to start something new, is this fear that they might fail rises up inside of them. And , they want to quit. They don't even want to give it a try, a fair try, because they're pretty sure they'll fail. That's what shame has told them.",

And if I can find enough wrong things about it, enough negative things, then I have an excuse to quit or to not even start. Take that a little bit further. For some, that then goes to the need to change in their life. And , what I find with people that come to react, and they begin to realize there's not an easy fix to trauma, I'm going to have to deal with some very old wounds that are going to be painful. I am going to have to use new tools that are going to be very challenging. I'm not willing to do that. , how do I get out of changing. , let's criticize React. Let's criticize all the teachers of React. Let's criticize the way they teach their content. Let's find something negative to justify me not changing. Another very subconscious thing that happens for people is if you are from complex trauma, there's a good chance your parents also have complex trauma. And you're just the next generation that's affected. if your parents have complex trauma, there's a good chance that they have a negative critical orientation. And you probably grew up with parents going to a social event, and then afterwards, just criticizing, pointing out all the flaws in different people, gossiping all the dirt about people. You grew up in an environment where your parents were always pointing out your flaws and not encouraging you and validating you in good ways. And as you grew up in that, without realizing it, you got those tapes in your head. now when you go into any situation, you just hear your parents' voices in your head, and they become your voices. they trained you as to have a negative orientation. Another thing that I find with many people I deal with is to notice what they get especially negative about. And often what they get negative and critical about when they meet somebody or watch somebody, the thing that bothers them the most about that person is usually the thing they the least in themselves. It's the part of them that made fun of, the part of them that they hated, wished that wasn't them.",

    "output": "Now, when they see that in somebody else, it triggers an immediate negative critical response to that person. But really, they're just projecting their own issues onto that person. Another way that many people from complex trauma try to solve, their shame, is they can't have a bigger house, they can't have more money than others, they can't compete in the looks arena, they can't compete in the sports arena and be better than others in any of those arenas. what they do is they go to the moral arena, the religious arena. And now my self-righteousness, I am more righteous than you, but how do I keep my sense of being more righteous than you. I point out all the ways you're not righteous. I focus on your moral flaws. it's necessary to feed a self-righteous attitude. Another thing that happens in complex trauma is that parents can have unrealistic expectations of their children. they can say to your child, you should have known I wanted that. In other words, to the child, you should be a mind reader. Or you should not be a child in the sense of being busy, being active, making noise, playing. You should be just quiet, seen not heard. And that unrealistic expectation caused parents to constantly be criticizing the child. And now they can say, you should have known I wanted that. And now parents can do that. In their adult life today, they can have unrealistic expectations of others, their spouse, their children, their friends. And if those people don't meet those unrealistic expectations, and they can't, then they find negative criticism about those people. Another thing that some parents can do is they wanted to have their children look only to them. They wanted to be the greatest influence, have the greatest power in their child's life. they wanted to create this extra loyalty to them, to the family. And one of the things that they often did is they then had to destroy everybody else that the children would not look to anybody else for guidance, for friendship, just to talk about things. they found fault with every friend the child brought home. They found fault with every family that the child was attracted to, just to try to create that loyalty. And sadly, within many complex trauma families, they developed a solution to their shame as being racism.",

One of the questions that I get asked all the time when people start realizing what shame is, is they ask me, am I ever going to get over this. Will I ever heal from shame. And what they're hoping I'll do is say, yes, on this date in 2020, you will be over your shame. And what they are really realizing though, as they get to understand shame is how deeply rooted it is, how much it affects every part of their life. And they begin to realize there's going to, this is going to be a lifetime journey that you have thousands of triggers. You have all kinds of things that get kicked into motion once you're triggered. And what you see when you start healing and growing is a bunch of different things. You get triggered less, first of all, and if you're dealing with the shame, once it's triggered, if you deal with it in a healthy way, then you don't get triggered as often in that same area. you'll start getting triggered less. And then if you're healing, the triggers become less intense, and then you're able to process through them more quickly. currently it could be that once your shame is triggered, you're wiped out for two days in your head and in all your dark places. As you heal and grow, you can begin to work on your shame. And what I'm trying to say is, if you're dealing with the work through stuff in five minutes, an hour, and you become kind of amazed at how quickly you get through stuff. it is possible to make lots of healing steps forward, but probably the journey will go on at some level, to some degree, for the rest of your life. But I don't want that to be discouraging, because as you start to feel the healing, you'll be surprised at how much better you feel overall. you will begin to experience benefits very quickly as you begin to deal with it. Part of what determines how long the journey is going to be is, how much shame is there in your life, number one, how many triggers do you have, and how safe are your relationships. You can't heal from shame in an unsafe environment.",

    "output": "you need to have safe, people, safe environment, or else, if you're with unsafe people, you just keep getting shame messages. the better you're able to have safe people, the faster you can heal from shame. Next thing I want you to understand is this. The initial healing from shame is very real, but it's very fragile. Some of you might have this experience. You've been working on yourself, say you've been coming to Finding Freedom, React, and you're starting to feel better about yourself. You're actually starting to respect yourself and accept yourself, and you're feeling really good, and then you go and spend the day with mom. And you come there going, I didn't think I, I guess I never learned anything. I'm back to feeling crappy about myself. And the point is this. You grew, but that growth is fragile. It's new leaves on a brand new baby plant. And the slightest thing can destroy them. part of what you have to do in recovery is really set boundaries to protect that growth it can solidify and become stronger and stronger. that is just up front that you need to be aware of. , I want to give you the four steps of healing that we've talked about far. And you may not have realized I was throwing some of these in as we went along. In the first five talks, but over there, every talk, there's been an element of self-awareness. And what we focused on last week is that to heal from shame, you have to take this thing that's been operating at a subconscious level and bring it to the conscious level. you understand how you're triggered, what you do when you're triggered, then you can change it once you get it to that conscious level. self-awareness is the first thing. Second thing, two weeks ago, we talked about the lies we believe about ourselves, both about our value and about what gives us value. And now you begin to replace those lies with the truth. And we talked about that and what it means to respect somebody else and the different types of respect. We've talked about all of that. the point was this. In dealing with shame, there is a cognitive part. There's a replacing part. There's a replacing part. There's a replacing part. There's a replacing part. There's a replacing part.",

    "output": "If you don't accept that the journey's this, you are going to beat yourself up and feed your shame every time you fall on your face. And you will not progress very far. accepting the nature of the journey is important. Now, let me add one piece to this. The problem with complex trauma is that failure becomes something that the person says, the person sees as only bad. Failure never led to anything good, just to pain and punishment. But what was the actual design of failure. It was positive. It was to be an example that you could learn from. failure was to be turned into a positive. That was the design. But if you come from a background where failure was always bad, and always was painful, you're afraid of failure. And what you're doing in recovery is changing your thinking there and saying, I'm going to fall on my face. That's not the end of the world. That doesn't mean I'm a total failure. That means I now have something I can learn from. I don't repeat that again. And it turns into a positive learning experience. Number eight. And you're going to see these all begin to overlap a little bit. But you have to forgive yourself for what you've done in the past. And when you fail today, you have to deal with it, change, and forgive yourself. what happens for a child that comes out of complex trauma. When you do something wrong, there's no way to fix it. You get punished for it. You get thrown in your face. And you learn that if you fail, beat yourself up. Beat yourself up. Get down on yourself. That's how you were parented. That's how you now parent yourself. That feeds shame. Now let me take it a step further. You have done a lot of things that you're greatly ashamed of. Stuff that has hurt your children and created trauma in them. You made a lot of mistakes in your children. You made mistakes in your teens and twenties that you wish you could redo and take back. But you have to, with complex trauma, go back to the child who's living in danger that they cannot resolve. They cannot fix. They cannot get out of to a healthy place. What was their only solution. Fight, flight, freeze. Survival.",

It means there's a lot of crap that you have to grieve. a couple things that I want you to think about. One of the things that you're grieving with shame. Is you didn't get a healthy childhood that you should have got. you're grieving something you never had. But you should have had. you've lost something that you've never had. But you've lost something you should have had. And part of what happens is people get to know about complex trauma. And their shame. Is they begin to realize how much their childhood affected them. And they start to go I wish I had a different childhood. I wish I didn't go through that. And then they start grieving what they didn't have. Secondly. You're grieving something that you should have lost. Secondly. You grieve the many losses that you did have. The loss of connection. The loss of certain friendships. The loss of certain things because of choices by family or yourself. there's a grieving part that is part of the healing process. Next one. You have to have a clean conscience. what we talked about in the first talk was this. Guilt is about what I do. Shame is about who I am. The problem with complex trauma is when you do something bad. They say you are bad. they blend guilt and shame. And what happens now when you fail. You do something morally wrong. You tell a lie. You cheat. Whatever. It feeds your shame. And you walk around saying not only did I fail. I'm a failure. And it feeds your shame. if you do something morally wrong and your conscience bothers you. Clean it up away. Because if you don't. It's going to keep bugging you. And it gradually is going to pull you into deeper shame. that becomes an important piece. Next one. Service. And what I want to say about this is for many people. Service is important. And it's important in finding out what I'm good at. What I can offer people. And it helps me heal. To realize I have something to offer. But for some people it's very dangerous. Because if you got your validation as a child. From helping everybody.",

Because it could pull you back into looking for validation. Which comes a drug. if that was part of your validation growing up. Be very careful as you get into service. Don't go there unless people in your life think you're ready for it. Because it's very easy to get there. And then once you're there. You stop working on yourself. And all that you're doing. And then if you're struggling. You're afraid to say anything. Because now everybody's looking up to you. And it becomes a disaster. Next one. Many people find there's a value in healing shame. In the spiritual thing. In a higher power. In a new belief system. That is a better definition of happiness. Of value. Of what makes life work. All of that can be important. If you do have or a higher power. That becomes for you a mirror. That you believe is the most accurate mirror in the world. And that tells you the truth about yourself. Better than anybody else. that one is important. Next one. Humility versus humiliation. Now here's what I want you to understand. A lot of people. Cultures. Religious people. Have defined humility as shame. Now I want you to understand that. If you go to many places. And ask them to define humility. Guess what they'll say. You're worse than everybody. You never walk around and say I accomplished something. You see yourself as less than. And if you ever feel good about yourself. Shame on you. You're proud. You're not. Shame on you. You're proud. You should be walking around saying I'm a nobody. I'm no good. And that's how they define humility. You realize that is the wrong definition. And if you're going to heal from shame. You need the definition of humility. And the definition of humility is this. You see yourself accurately. And what does it mean to see yourself accurately. I'm not better than or worse than anybody. You're not a better person. You're not a better person. You're not a better person. You're not a better person. You're not a better person. You're not a better person. You're not a better person.

I don't want to get locked into this place. And humiliated was terrible. Humility is totally different. It is seeing myself accurately. It is being open to change, to growth, to learning. And that is absolutely essential if you're going to heal shame. Now the next one is inner child. Now we spend a lot of time at React. Let me just say a few things. Inner child for a lot of people, they go, Oh, that's hokey. That's just weird. What are you going to ask me to do. here's how I talk about it. I think everybody that I deal with from complex trauma, if I say, do you still sense there's a little child in you somewhere. They all agree. And then I go, let's just focus on that little child inside of you, which is a younger you. What emotions is that child. What is that child feeling. And they'll go, wow, they're hurt. They're sad. They're angry. They're full of fear. They got tons of shame. And they hate themselves. I say,. that child, that inner you, that little you, has nothing but negative emotions. How does that child look physically. They got their head down. They're curled up in a fetal position. They can't look at people in the eye. They can define and describe that child. How does that child feel about you, the adult. Ooh, he doesn't trust me. Why. Because I abandoned that child. I hated that part of me. I didn't want anything to do with that part of me. I was impatient with that part of me. I was embarrassed by that part of me. that child feels abandoned by you and doesn't trust you. But that child is you. It's a part of you. healing from shame is taking that part of you that you've rejected and been embarrassed by and accepting it and nurturing it that it feels loved and it can heal and become part of the adult you. that's what this is about. then I say,. Let's just say one of your biological children spilled their milk or fell off their bike and tore a hole in their brand new pair of pants.",

    "output": "tonight I want to start a new series. I mentioned it to you two weeks ago on codependency. here's my thing for it. If you leave me, can I come with you. Which is codependency in a nutshell. If I leave you, can I come. If you leave me, can I come with you. I've been teaching codependency for 15 years now. And if me, I'm always learning. And every time I teach it in workshops, I get new insights and questions get asked that take me in a little different direction. And this series is going to be kind of a blend of some of the older stuff that I've taught, but a lot of the newer stuff that I've put together over the last couple years. And it's probably going to be an 8 to 10 week series just because there's much material that I want to cover. And let me just say a couple introductory. Codependency is a term that has become overworked. And a lot of people hear it and they just tune it out because they think they know what it means. And it's kind of gained its own baggage. And a lot of people really don't understand it. And that's part of why I want to do this series. But secondly, if you were to come to React on any given week, there would not be a week that would pass where codependency wouldn't come up. It is one of the most talked about things in recovery. It is one of the questions I get most frequently by clients in recovery. And what I have seen is an extremely important topic. Not just because I get asked about it a lot, but what I have found over the years is a lot of people come into Finding Freedom and React and they think that drugs and alcohol is their main addiction. But what I have learned is that it's not. What I have learned is that probably an addiction to a person is probably a greater addiction. And that is a codependency thing. And what I have found is if they don't deal with that, that will keep them not only messed up in their personal life and in their relationships, but that will keep taking them to relapse to drugs and alcohol.",

    "output": "And I would say that probably the greatest cause of relapse that I have seen is codependent relationships. It does much damage. And it is one of the hardest things to deal with because it plays off of natural human needs, relationships, love, belonging. And when people come into recovery and they're lonely and they're hurting and they're broken, they long for a relationship and usually end up in a romantic one that is codependent. And it just makes life worse for them. And leads to a relapse. And it is, in my mind, one of the most important topics for people to face in their recovery if they have a chance of making it in recovery, but also if they want to have a healthy life. And to have healthy relationships. And to have their kids grow up seeing mom or dad getting healthy, not just keeping the old crisis cycle happening. Over and over again. Which does a lot of damage to them. The next thing that is important for me in explaining this is, there's lots of teaching about codependency that's out there, but I don't think you can really understand codependency until you understand complex trauma. Do you realize that everybody basically that is codependent has complex trauma. And it is one of the main symptoms. That come out of complex trauma. And you need to understand the complex trauma piece if you ever hope to deal with the codependency piece in your life. And that's why I want to look at this topic, but I want to look at it from the perspective of complex trauma that you'll more clearly see the issues that need to change and be dealt with if you ever hope to really deal with that. And I want to look at this topic, and I want to look at it from the perspective of complex trauma. I want to look at it from the perspective of how we can deal with the codependency piece. What you're probably going to find is that this is going to get really heavy for you at times. And there's going to be times where you're going to say, I am screwed up, I just want to end it now.

That's how personal this will get for you. But then it's going to get painful because you're going to see the damage it's done to your kids as. But I don't want to just take you to a painful realization. I want this to turn into tools you can heal and develop healthy relationships. let me start by just helping you get an intro to the topic tonight. And I just want to show how codependency comes out of complex trauma. complex trauma, in my mind, the greatest piece of damage that it does is in a person's sense of their identity. it does in a child who is neglected and abused and abandoned. They think the reason that dad is neglecting me or abusing me is because there's something wrong with me. And they draw conclusions about their identity that I must not be good enough, I must not be lovable, otherwise dad wouldn't abuse me or neglect me or abandon me. And complex trauma produces this core identity called shame. And that is what does the greatest amount of damage in my mind when it comes to understanding complex trauma. Now take a child with shame thinking it's all my fault and then put them in a situation where they're trying to survive and stay safe. And what comes out of that is it makes a healthy relationship impossible. complex trauma takes the possibility of healthy relationships and it makes it impossible to have a healthy relationship with a healthy person. And that's what we're talking about. Because of shame and because of being in survival mode. And anybody coming out of complex trauma knows how to have a kind of relationship but it's not a healthy one. And that is where the damage happens. And what comes out of that is they go into relationships but they don't know how to make them healthy and they don't know how to make them happy. And the very thing they're trying to do is keep safe they are now actually producing the opposite. They're setting up relationships where they keep getting hurt.",

I've had many clients who when they know a relationship is about to die, they don't end it until they got somebody else waiting. And then they end this one and move into the next. Because they can't be alone. Because being alone proves to them their greatest fear that they are unlovable. then the next thing is now you're in a relationship. how do I get them to see value in me.

You think if you're real, you will never get positive validation. But then you go further in your thinking, and that is not only do I have to be happy, I got to keep them happy. Because if they ever get disappointed or angry at me, they might leave me. Or if they're ever sad, they might just get depressed with their relationship and leave me. the only way they're going to keep giving me positive validation is if I'm happy, but I got to keep them happy. what does that mean. I can't be happy unless they're happy. My happiness now depends on them being happy. therefore, my priority now is I'm going to take responsible for their emotional world, and if they got a problem, I'll fix it for them just they'll stay happy. If they're angry, I'll calm them down and fix everything up just they're happy. now they don't have to grow up at all.

And then what you can see comes out all of this is the narcissist is the superior and you are definitely inferior. They look down on you. They see you as a servant. They don't even treat you with respect, but they demand respect from you. there is a dynamic relationship change where there's no longer equals here. This is a relationship of a superior narcissist and an inferior person. Beyond that, a healthy relationship over time, both parties make sacrifices about 50 of the time. Both parties, one person gets their kind of what they want to do one day, the other person another day, and it balances out to about 50. if you were to go to Bermuda with Kim and I, there were some days Kim did what I wanted, there's other days I did what she wanted. Because that's just what you do. But not in a codependent relationship. Now one person gets their way 100 of the time and the other person gets their way 0 of the time. And that is not healthy. But there's always within the codependent hope that they will change. And you stay in it and stay in it. , that's a lot of heavy stuff. And I just want to keep going very quickly. a child wasn't taught in complex trauma how to meet their own needs in a healthy way. That's number one. I'm just adding now to how complex trauma is. I'm just adding now to how complex trauma affects children and sets them up for codependency. they weren't taught how to meet their own needs. Their parents didn't meet their needs. their own needs are something they're very out of touch with. And they don't have a clue how to be aware of them or how to meet them. All they know is how to set them aside and meet somebody else's needs. Next thing, complex trauma is all about a child feeling unsafe and alone. Nobody having their back. Nobody protecting them.",

But what I want to do tonight is kind of introduce you to this topic. And I think most of that it's a very important topic. I deal with people every day. And what I've learned over the years is that anger for people who are in recovery is one of the biggest relapse triggers. many, most addicts at some point in time have got angry at somebody and that's triggered them to want to go use their drink either to punish that person. I'll show you, I'll hurt you by getting drunk, which means I'll hurt you by hurting me. And they do that or they go and use just because that's where their brain wants to go to kind of get over the anger. it's a massive issue for people. And that's why I want to talk about it because I've seen just how big of an issue it is. But I want to bring into this whole discussion, not just what you would normally hear in an anger management course, but I want you to understand how complex trauma makes this anger issue multiple times more difficult to deal with. And I'm going to give you the kind of the cold facts up front. If you're from complex trauma, you're going to have a lot of trouble dealing with this. If you're from complex trauma, you've got anger issues and they're going to be even more difficult to deal with. But I hope we can move to some tools that you find very helpful in beginning to deal with this area of your life. What I do when I begin teaching, we do a whole week on anger at React. What I do at the very beginning is just start asking questions and making comments to help people get in touch with their own anger issues. And I'm going to give you a little bit of a lesson here. I'm going to give you a little bit of a lesson here. I'm going to give you a little about anger issues. I get a lot of people that will say they've been angry for as long as they can remember. They're just not sure why.",

They've probably got tons of anger that they are disconnected from that they're not even aware that anger is probably influencing all kinds of the decisions they make on a regular basis. And a lot of people from complex trauma have shut down their anger system or they think they have and they don't think it is an issue. I hope by the end of the night that you'll realize that you're angry and I know you'll probably be angry at me for pointing out that you got anger issues and I've got used to that. Some who are aware of their anger issues are afraid of their own anger and they are afraid that if their anger gets triggered where it might take them. And that for them makes this a very important topic. And what I have seen is when it comes to guilt in people dealing with trauma and who are in recovery from addiction, their greatest amount of guilt usually comes from stuff they did while they were in the problem. Using what they did to their kids, etc. But the second greatest cause of guilt is usually what they've done when they've been angry. Things they've said, things they've done to their kids, to their partner, to friends, the family that they can't take back. And the damage has been done and they see the damage and it causes a ton of guilt. that tells me further that this anger subject is a problem. And I think that's a very important topic. And I think that's a very important topic. And I think that's a very important topic. And I think that's a very important topic.

Zero anger or living with the needle in the red, constantly ready to blow a fuse and explode at any moment. that's an evaluation for you. And then in the last two months of your life. Where would you rank your anger. Would it be the same as your average over the last 10 years. Or is there a lot less anger in your life these days.

And a volcano has all of the lava that is down below the surface. That is seething, bubbling away all the time. And then every once in a while there's an eruption. anger one is the lava. Anger two is the eruption. Most anger management courses focus on the eruption type of anger. And how to control that. The difference with complex trauma is that the lava anger is the main issue.

Where you yell things. You throw things. You hit things. You hit people. You call people down. Your language changes. It gets super cruel. All of that is explosion type anger. A lot of people think. That's the only type of anger. they think if I don't explode. Then I don't have anger problems. But there's three other types. the next one is the stuffer. And that is the person that learned early on. That if you express anger. You get punished. bottle it up. Push it down. Stuff it deep inside of you. And then never express it. Now here's what I want you to understand. What we know now from suppressed anger emotions. Is it damages you physically. It damages your physical health. people who are angry. People who stuffed all of that anger. Usually end up with major health issues. high blood pressure. Sleep problems. Constantly irritable. All of those things. And it can go to migraine headaches. And other health issues. They're now seeing a connection between cardiac or heart problems. And anger problems. And even cancer issues. And anger problems. stuffed anger. You might think you have it under control. But if you've not resolved it. You've only stuffed it. You're setting yourself up as a ticking time bomb. Physically. Third type. Is you punish yourself. part of what happens in complex trauma. Is if somebody's upset. You are made to think it's your fault. And then when you were told that it was your fault. You were then punished. And what you did is take your parents critical voice. And their critical response. And you do it to yourself now. if somebody's upset. You go I must have done something wrong. Beat myself up. If you fail. If you disappoint somebody. If you don't do it as planned. If you don't do it as perfectly as you hoped. Beat self up. Beat self up.

And punishing yourself for a while. That is anger turned inward. And it is super common in complex trauma people. Fourth, underhanded. Now let me say just as you're processing this. Most people will try all four of these. Some will end up picking all four. And then they'll go to the sequence. you might start by stuffing stuff for a little bit. Then you beat yourself up for a bit. Then you're going to go to the next one underhanded. And then you'll explode. Everybody will have their own style. Some will have only three of the four.

That goes this. When you feel anger. Severe danger. Leads to anger. Leads to adrenaline. Leads to cortisol. All of those things. That give you a supercharged response. To what's going on inside of you. You go into full activation. When you're in severe danger. Now what they're finding. With people who have childhood trauma. Or PTSD from horrific events. war.

And I'm dead inside otherwise. anger, for most people out of complex trauma, is their default setting. That's where you will gravitate towards if you're not working on yourself. the final piece that I want you to see here is I think the greatest way to understand complex trauma is to understand the way in which you're working on yourself. The first one is that complex trauma's greatest damage is to your identity. And we call it shame. instead of seeing yourself as valuable and a loving, valuable person, you see yourself as not valuable, not lovable. Your identity, instead of being positive, becomes negative. And one way to understand shame is that as shame builds in your life, it requires you to be angry at yourself. Because you don't that you're unlovable. You hate that you don't have any value for who you are. Or at least that's what you think. Though that is not true. But that's what you think is true. And your anger naturally turns inward because of shame and complex trauma. what I do with clients all the time is I put on the board, who are the people that you've been angry with. they'll start with partner, parents, family, friends. Then they'll go to authorities. Cops, bosses, CFS, etc. Then that'll go to. He's the ultimate authority. And then it'll go to self. And then they begin to realize, I'm basically mad at everything. That's what my world has become. I'm mad at me, I'm mad at the world. And everything in it. And that is a very sad place to live. that's where the lack of self-love comes in.

Now the problem with complex trauma is a lot of jealousy, you want to say the other person is cheating on you, but they're not. It's your own shame. And you're just convinced that if they get to know you, they're going to leave you and find somebody else. your jealousy, isn't based in reality, it's based in the distortions of beliefs that come out of your shame. And that is something to be working on, because if you don't, you're going to be getting jealous all the time, and each time you do, you're doing damage. And pretty soon the relationship won't be able to recover from it. And then the final one, gossip. As surely as a north wind brings rain, it's going to rain. And in Israeli climate, if the north wind was blowing, it was going to rain. You could count on it. It was a definite given. a gossiping tongue, what can you count on. Anger will follow. Just a north wind, rain follows, gossip, anger follows. You start telling stuff to other people that you should be keeping to yourself, you talk behind people's backs, you're going to have angry people. that's just five. Over the next weeks, we're going to look at a lot more triggers of anger. But I thought for tonight, I'd give you a taste of the insight the has into why we get angry, what we need to be aware when it comes to looking at our anger, and beginning to create in us a deeper commitment to deal with this issue in our lives. Let's. Father, it's an area that most of us have had times or still have times that this anger is a huge problem and it does much damage. And I just that in this series you would help each person to grow in learning to manage their anger and learning to have their cortex brain trump their limbic brain. Amen. , that is our evening.

    "output": "welcome to another Friday night. We've been going through a series on life traps or prisons that come out of complex trauma and it's really looking at the things that children had to do to survive. the behavior patterns, the thinking patterns, the emotion patterns that developed because of their trauma in childhood that they successfully used to survive all of that and even to look they were doing really. But now in adult life those very patterns are causing them to have all kinds of problems. They're preventing healthy relationships, they're hurting their children, they're messing up jobs and starting to take their toll on them personally. But when people go to change those all of a sudden they find there's something in them that doesn't want to change them. There's something in them that gravitates back and forth between them and their children. And they're trying to back to those as a default setting as a place that feels very normal and almost safe to them. And it's a huge challenge for people in recovery from complex trauma to realize that many of the things that they did to survive now have become prisons and they're really challenging to begin to change. And we've been identifying some of the major life traps or prisons that people have when they come out of complex trauma. And today I want to look at one that is prevalent, common, and it's people pleasing. And part of what makes it difficult for people is they got tons of validation for it. It wasn't just that it helped them succeed and survive, it got them tons of validation. somebody has said this about this life trap. This is the person who to a large degree experiences the world in terms of their life. And they're not just the person who's going to die, they're going to experience the world in terms of their life. And they're going to experience the world in terms of control issues. Other people in their life always seem to be in control. They feel controlled by the people around them. At the core is the conviction that they must please others, that they must please parents, brothers, sisters, friends, teachers, lovers, spouses, bosses, co-workers, children, and even strangers.",

    "output": "Peace in your family was not about justice and love happening. It was about submitting to what a narcissist wanted. And as long as everybody fully submitted to what the narcissist wanted, there was peace or what looked peace. Everybody could relax. And what got emphasized in your family as a strong value is submission. You need to submit to the authority. That's the only way to have peace. Possibly you grew up where your parents saw you as a unique child, a child who was a bit different. And they were afraid to let you kind of have autonomy, to do your own thing, to follow your dreams, to follow your desires, because they were afraid that you would go against social norms, that others would start looking down on your family because you were different. And they had to try to control you and keep you in a box. Or you grew up in a family where your parents saw children as being naturally selfish. And it was emphasized to them that they had to train you to be obedient, to train you to be responsible. Because if they just let you go, then you would just be irresponsible and wild. And their focus was not to understand their children or to meet their children's emotional needs. Their focus was get your children to obey, get your children to be responsible. It's possible you grew up in a family where your parents kind of gave you the role of being the hero child. You were going to be the perfect child. You were going to be the child that took care of everybody else, super responsible, sacrificed all your needs, and you got tons of validation for being that child. Or you grew up with a parent who was a narcissist. It was all about what they wanted. It was their way or the highway. They abused their position of authority. It was all about them getting, what they wanted. There was no discussion, negotiation, or compromise. And their needs, their desires, always were placed ahead of everybody else's and you were expected to submit. those are some of the things that could have happened in your childhood. Now let me take it then to complex trauma. Because all of those ways of parenting or things you might have experienced would have. made a child feel unsafe.",

What is happening in all of those things. when there is danger, the brain's first two responses is the first two F's, fight or flight. Let's fight back. Let's get ourselves safe through running away or fighting. The problem for most children is they're too little to fight or flight. And the brain goes, those two F's don't work. Let's go to the third F, freeze. And they start shutting down. They start suppressing all their needs, all their emotions in order to survive. But then the brain says, but I'm little, I still need others to meet my needs because I can't meet them myself. they have to go to the fourth F. And that's fawning. And fawning is what I want you to see, the most extreme last resort survival tactic that the brain comes up with. And basically what fawning is, is you be what others want. You people please. You never say no. You always be pleasant. You give up all your needs and take care of people. You be attuned to other people and what they want. And their needs, not to yourself, because that's the only way to survive. you look a wonderful child. You look the most agreeable, giving, caring child in the world, but you're fawning. You're desperately trying to survive. You're giving that somebody hopefully won't hurt you, that somebody hopefully will meet your needs. fawning is last resort survival. Survival method that the brain comes up with when someone is small and their needs are not being met. Life is dangerous for them, but they desperately need somebody to care for them. Now what comes out of all of the complex trauma is the child develops shame. They develop the belief that the reason they're being neglected and abused and abandoned is it's their fault. they don't themselves. They think I'm the problem. I'm not lovable. I'm not good enough. I'm inferior to everybody else. And people pleasing comes out of this shame as. Because how do I get people to me. I need them to me because I don't myself. the only way I'm going to get positive feelings towards myself is if other people have positive feelings towards me.",

And deep down I believe nobody else will either if they see the real me. the only way people will respect me and therefore that they can be happy, and therefore that I can respect myself, is if I please them. If they really me, if I do whatever they want, then they will respect me. That's again what they hope will be the solution to their shame. But another part of shame is I can't stand up for myself. I can't say no to anybody because if I do they will get mad at me. They won't me for saying no. They will reject me. They will see how terrible I am. Therefore, I can't have anybody reject me. I can't ever stand up for myself because that will expose my shame. I must please, please, please people constantly to try to solve my shame. shame is such a huge factor behind people pleasing. But there's another factor that comes out of complex trauma and that is guilt. many families with complex trauma and that create complex trauma have the cycle of abuse. And what comes out of that is after the violence takes place, or the blow up happens, the crisis happens, everybody's on their best behavior. Everybody's people pleasing. Why. Because they feel bad about what they just did. They're trying to make up for what they just did. And now they're just saying yes to everybody, people pleasing to make up for their guilt. And what happens. What happens to a lot of parents who've done a lot of damage by being involved in addiction, in criminal activity, been in jail, and now they're back with their kids, they just say yes to their kids constantly because of guilt. They're afraid to say no because they're afraid their kids are going to get upset and feel that their parents are being mean again. A fourth thing that comes out of complex trauma is that you learn to submit.",

They start to realize that those were actually maladaptations. They are leading to more and more pain in their life. complex trauma forces a child to have to adapt. Those adaptations give immediate positive consequences. And it's not till 20 or 30 years later that you begin to realize, wow, those are all negative. And it is doing nothing but bringing pain into my life. Now, it's important to understand that the child that adapted at three, four, five, six years old, they didn't tell lies. They didn't manipulate. They didn't keep secrets because they wanted to, because they thought it was a good idea that's the kind of person they wanted to be. No, they did it because that's all they knew how to do to survive. Those were the only tools available to them. They weren't saying, oh, I want to become this very unhealthy, bad person that nobody trusts and everybody turns against.",

Initially, it's not their fault that they chose to lie. They chose to keep secrets. They chose to manipulate. It's not their fault. That's what they had to do to survive. But they reach a point in adult life where they begin to realize, hey, I'm in a safe environment now. I don't need to lie. I don't need to wear masks. I don't need to manipulate. If I continue to lie now, that's on me. If I continue to manipulate now, that's on me. I am now responsible to change my way of relating to people. From the old adaptations, which I now see are maladaptations, I now have to choose a different lifestyle. And if I don't, that is now on me. It is now my fault. that's the first thing that they did. And then the second thing that they did was they chose to lie. It's my fault for the behavior that I'm choosing. they were initially forced into that behavior. It wasn't really their choice. But now they are in a place where they can choose whether they can continue that behavior or not. The second piece, and we've talked about, is the limbic brain is running the show in the child's life, but also in complex trauma. the limbic brain is constantly in the driver's seat. It has to be in the driver's seat, not just because it's a child, because they need to survive, because there's danger everywhere. the cortex doesn't develop properly. And the child doesn't transition from being governed by the limbic brain to a mature adult who's governed by the cortex. They get to adulthood still governed by the limbic brain. And as long as that is happening, they are still making decisions. They are still making decisions based on instant gratification, not based on long-term consequences. And they are never going to make good decisions. They are always going to make decisions that give immediate positive consequences, but terrible long-term consequences. And complex trauma sets a person up to still be governed more by their limbic brain.",

You get them to do behavior. You train animals today. You get them to do behavior. You reward them. You keep doing that. Pretty soon you just give the command and they do the behavior. You can train somebody that if you do this, this would be the consequence. You do that long enough. Pretty soon they'll do that and they just expect that consequence will be there. a good consequence trains them to do a certain behavior.

They get rewarded for the wrong thing. They get rewarded for their body. They get rewarded for only working hard, for only helping people. And now they go, all my value comes from my body, from producing, from being productive. It doesn't come from who I am. They have been trained through the use of consequences to develop the wrong approach to life. Another one is a child naturally hopes. now every time in complex trauma, they get their hopes up. They get their hopes up. They get their hopes up. They get their hopes up. That they're going to get love. Their needs are going to get met. It doesn't happen. They get pain. after a while, they go, stop hoping. Hope is a bad thing. It always results in getting hurt.

You started a one action that trip to trip wire that's got 50 actions that are now all going to flow.

And you did that thousands of times. That became part of your subconscious.

Sometimes I actually get pain for a good consequence for a good behavior, It's all confusing what do I do and that's complex trauma. and what we have found with addiction issues is Addictions that give inconsistent consequences are some of the hardest addictions to break. take for example gambling Sometimes you win sometimes you lose.

It should in their decision-making processes they just Again, get preoccupied with instant gratification and don't even think long-term consequences should be factored in.

I think an illustration that might help you understand this is , think of a great big swimming pool of crystal clear water, and at five-year-old, you take a little eyedropper of ink, and you squirt it into the pool. It looks there's zero consequence. Pool is still crystal clear. The next day, you put a little dropper of ink in the pool, and it goes on and on and on, and you don't begin to experience, the negative consequences of the eyedropper of ink until years later. When you start to go, the pool's a bit, I don't the color of the pool, but , it's still safe. There's still a lot of positive. that delayed experience of the consequences that show up very gradually, and the positives still outweigh the negatives for many years. That's the reality of complex trauma and the experience of long-term consequences. But then we have some tendencies when that starts to happen. Our brain tends to focus on accenting the positive benefits that we're still getting, and minimizing, denying, or rationalizing the negative. we choose to see life in a skewed way, where we overemphasize, but look how positive it is, and underemphasize the negative.

    "output": "But last week we started a new series on codependency. And what I said in that opening talk on that was, in my experience as an addictions counselor, one of the main causes of things that lead people to a relapse is they get into a relationship that is a codependent relationship. And before we know it, they have become back into kind of addicted to a person. And all of their addictive behavior and all of their old ways of doing things kick in. And before it, they're all messed up inside and they end up relapsing to the drugs or alcohol. it is a huge issue that many in recovery have to deal with if they ever want to stay clean and sober. But then I said beyond that, I don't think codependency is properly understood until people understand the complex trauma. And that, to me, is significant because one of the symptoms of complex trauma is it sets people up to become codependent, which means it sets people up that their relationships aren't healthy and end up failing. that's why I want to do this series is because it's such a big issue for people in recovery. It's one of the most common questions that I receive from clients when they are trying to recover. And I think that's a big issue. And I think that's a big issue. And I think that's a big issue.

And what I want you to understand up front is that when I say codependency, I have a spectrum in my mind. there is kind of mild codependency to severe codependency. you might say, I don't think I'm codependent because I'm not in the severe end of the spectrum. But you might have some of the more mild parts of codependency that still can get you into a lot of trouble in a relationship. taking that, what I want to talk about tonight is the more severe end of the codependency spectrum.",

And when you are in the more severe end of the codependency spectrum, there's usually a narcissist who's part of that relationship. But what I want you to understand tonight is in order for a narcissist to be in a relationship, there's got to be a co-narcissist. And I will explain that in a little bit. And my hunch would be that most of you here would either fall in the category of a narcissist or a co-narcissist. Now, they're supposed to be on the back of your handout, a test that you can take to see if you're a narcissist or a co-narcissist. And then, don't do that when I'm talking, because I want you to listen. And I don't want you all of a sudden getting super depressed or super angry or just stomping out because you're mad. I didn't invent the test. It is produced by the American Psychological Society as what they use to measure narcissism and co-narcissism. , let me. Now, take that back to complex trauma. What we have seen is that complex trauma is living in danger basically all the time. you are constantly in survival mode. What happens when you're in survival mode is that you have to make your needs and your survival more important than the needs of others. you put yourself in a narcissistic place. Your needs now matter. You now matter more than anything else in the world. Now, what happens in one-event trauma is in survival mode, fight, flight, freeze, you put your needs and yourself ahead of everybody else until the danger passes, and then you come back down to feeling and acting equal to everybody, and you enter into loving relationships again where you value them and they value you just as much. The tragedy of complex trauma, is you're constantly living in danger, you're constantly living with you mattering more than anybody else. complex trauma sets you up to become a narcissist. That's what you had to do to survive. Now, I'm not beating you up by saying that. I'm saying that's what survival mode that happens 24-7 looks.",

    "output": "Your needs have to become more important than everybody else, complex trauma is the birthplace of narcissism. Now, let me take that a little bit further. The other effect of complex trauma is that the child is abused, abandoned, or neglected, and they conclude it's their fault. it develops shame. the greater the abuse, the greater the neglect, the greater the abandonment, the more it's a problem. The more the child takes home the message and personalizes that I must not matter at all, I must be totally unlovable, I must have zero value, and they develop this belief about themselves that they are not good enough, they're less than. the greater the trauma, the greater the shame. Now, with that in mind, what I want you to understand is that narcissism is a response to severe shame. when a person is in a place where they feel totally they're nothing because of severe trauma, they have severe shame, that is no fun to live with. Who wants to walk around saying, I suck, I'm useless, nobody, everybody should know I'm totally unlovable and have zero value. No, that is just way too depressing to live with. That is just way too painful to live with. the brain begins to develop ways of trying to get rid of that. narcissism, to understand it correctly, it is the brain doing everything possible to either deny that it has any shame at all, or to overcompensate and feel that it doesn't have any shame, it tries to disprove that there's any shame at all, and tries to prove that it has great value, that it is totally lovable, and it goes to the place that I'm better than everybody. narcissism comes out of complex trauma as a response to severe trauma and severe shame. That's what I want you to understand up front. Now let me take it a bit further. response number one to severe shame is the narcissist. I am better than everybody. And the way I will make my life is that I will try to be the center of the universe. And everybody needs to revolve around me because life is now going to be all about me. there you are, center of the universe.",

    "output": "Everybody is now in an orbit, around you, taking their cues from you about how they should act, what emotions they should show, and making sure that you're happy. that's how codependency begins. Now what I want you to understand with that is that narcissism is a big monster that needs to be fed all the time. a narcissist needs somebody adoring him all the time. That's how he's fed. guess what that creates is what we call a co-narcissist or a mirror or an echo that reflects back to the narcissist. You're wonderful. I adore you. You're such a beautiful person. And the narcissist is getting fed. narcissists don't go into relationships with a healthy person who's not going to feed them. They go look at them. They're looking for a co-narcissist who will feed them and reflect back to them a mirror how wonderful they are. That is the co-narcissist thing. Now what you have to understand about the co-narcissist is they walk around saying, I'm awful. I'm terrible. They don't try to compensate for their shame. They give in to their shame. And they are depressed. They are feeling bad. They are feeling terrible about themselves. They hate themselves. They live with that feeling all the time. Guess what they want. A narcissist to be the sun of their world who comes in and shines their light on them and says, I you. Let me help you. I'll fix you. And they go, oh, I do have value. This important person just noticed me and wants to help me. And now you have the sun and the planet working beautifully together. That is a narcissist and that is a co-narcissist. , let me take that a bit further. that goes beyond just the couple,. there you are, the sun of the universe. Everything has to revolve around you. The co-narcissist says, let me take care of your emotions. You're sad. Let me make you happy. You're angry. Let me fix your problems. You're in trouble. Let me make all your bad consequences go away. And they give up all their. They make all kinds of sacrifices to keep the sun of their universe happy because they can't be happy unless the sun is happy. And that's codependency,. But it spreads beyond the couple to the family.",

And the children get neglected because the narcissist is all wrapped up pursuing their selfish endeavors. The children get abandoned or abused if they don't cooperate with the narcissist. , children don't living that. That's painful. children in their own mind are trying to solve the family problems that arise when a narcissist is the sun within the family system. And children will adopt different roles to try to fix the family and to try to make the narcissist happy. And each child will try different things as a way to solve their family problems and to try to get the narcissist to meet their needs and validate them and not neglect them or abuse them. that's where you get the child that says, I'll be a hero. I will be the perfect child. I will never cause problems. I will do extra chores. I will get straight A's at school. I will never get a fighter in trouble. I will do all kinds of things extra around the house just to make everything run smoothly. Trying to solve the problem. Then you get the comedian child who says, there's a whole lot of pain in this family. The way to solve it is to be funny and laughing all the time. I'll be the jokester, the comedian, the storyteller, and I'll make everybody happy. And that'll fix our family. And then the invisible child says, I'll have no needs. I will fade into the background. I'll never ask for anything. I'll hide out in my room that I don't add any extra stress to this family because it is not in a good place. each child can try different ones. They can try all three. Most will settle in on one. But what they're going to find as they get older is it didn't fix the thing. The narcissist wasn't happy. The narcissist didn't meet their needs. The narcissist didn't validate them. And they took it personally and developed their own shame and said, it's my fault. I'm the problem.

You don't have to meet all 18, but you got to meet at least half of them,. here we go. A narcissist, if you don't know what a narcissist, where it comes from, let me quickly give you the back story. It comes from a Greek myth. back in a long time ago in Greece, before there were ever mirrors, you never saw a reflection of yourself. And one day this guy named narcissist, he goes out to get a drink of water at the pond. And it's nice and calm that day and the sun's shining just and he looks into the pond to get a drink of water and he sees his reflection. And he goes, that is the handsomest guy I've ever seen in my life. I fall in love with you. I'm coming back every day just to look at myself and admire myself and how beautiful I am. That's where narcissism came from. That's the idea,. number one, they believe they are special and unique, which means they think they're a little bit better than everybody else. But the reason we say they think they're special is they think they can only be understood by special people. what that means is if you call them on your stuff, they have a comeback that says, you don't get me because you're not special. Only the people understand my greatness. they have that system in their mind. Second thing, deep down, they may not say it, they might say it, but they do believe they are more important than other people. That they're smarter, more capable, better in every category almost. Next, they exaggerate their achievements. they didn't just catch a fish this big, they catch a fish this big,. you get that kind of thing. That kind of exaggeration that takes place. And they expect to be recognized by you as being better than you. they expect you to look up to them and kind of adore them and stand in awe of how great they are.",

Now, if you've been in a relationship with a narcissist, you'll understand this next one. They must never, they must never be wrong. Because their image says you, they always have to be. if you are in a conflict with a narcissist, they will never admit they're wrong, but rather, they will take what happened and twist it to make you wrong. And they will take what you say and twist it to make you wrong. what I say to people, don't argue with a narcissist, because the more you try to convince them of your truth, the more they're going to twist what you say and use it against you. Because they must never be wrong. And then, at first a narcissist can act very caring, but as their true colors come out, you find they don't really have much empathy or care for other people's needs or feelings at all. Rather, they're, it's all about me, causes them to feel very entitled. That you owe me special treatment. You have to meet all of my needs. I don't have to meet any of your needs. a relationship with a narcissist is never giving 50-50. It's always lopsided. You're doing the majority of the giving, they're doing all the getting. And that is their sense of entitlement. Then, they don't think rules apply to them. they live by a double standard. Rules apply to you, but not to me. I can go through your phone, you can't go through mine. rules don't apply to them. They're the exception in their mind to every rule. Don't know how you're scoring yourself far, but I'll keep going. What I mean by they're exploitive of others is this. Narcissists are people who are all about manipulating you to meet their needs. Narcissists don't know how to love people, they just know how to use people. Now in their minds, they're being loving. Because they're giving, they're kind in their early days. But what they're really doing is grooming you. They're giving to get.

And narcissists become master manipulators. They can get good at manipulating, sometimes you're not even aware that they're manipulating you. Usually there's always a hidden agenda that's happening when you're working with a narcissist, and when you first meet a narcissist and they say, tell me about yourself, and you pour out your heart, and tell them about you, and tell them everything about yourself, guess what they're doing. They're taking notes. Oh , here's where I can manipulate them. I got their hot button. Now I know what to use if I want to get something badly. They're taking notes on you. They must feel control, and they must always get what they want. Now this is important to understand from this perspective. Narcissists can be the sweetest, nicest people in the world, 99 of the time, until they don't get what they want. And then you got World War III. They explode, and there is to pay to anybody who has crossed them. what I'm saying is this. Narcissists can act very healthy until they're triggered. And it's those triggers that reveal their true colors. They can no longer hide their deeper stuff once they get triggered. The masks come away, and they come out. some of the main triggers for a narcissist are perceived rejection. if you reject them or say no to them, watch out. Not getting what they want, not getting enough attention. You're not feeding me enough, or anything that messes with their image. what happens if they don't get what they want, or they get triggered. Usually they go to anger, and then they get cruel, abusive, they lash out, they say extremely hurtful things, and they can be very destructive. Just that one trigger can set off a whole lot of painful things, and they can do that, and not even have a conscience about it. you often don't know a person's a narcissist until one of their triggers get triggered.

And that is a huge issue for some people that is very hard to get over because of some of the stuff that they get told.

But what concerns me is that there's been a lot of sloppy thinking about that. And it has turned a lot of people off of. let me explain some of that sloppy thinking. the first one is this. I had people come to me, clients, and say, if 's in control, why didn't he stop my uncle from sexually abusing me. If he loves me he says he does and he's king and he's sovereign in control, he could have stopped it. the fact that he didn't stop it, he's either an unloving or he really isn't in control. And they then go, I don't want a that was in control. Supposedly, and didn't stop bad things from happening. And then they hear it through the ears that go, are you saying to me that it was 's will that I got sexually abused. Are you saying to me that it's 's will that these children in war-torn countries get slaughtered in a genocide. How can that be 's will.",

Some parents, when a child does something wrong in their mind, they subject the child to a long rant. And they can go on for 15 minutes, 20 minutes, a half hour, an hour, preaching a to the child on why they shouldn't do what they're doing, how it's making the family look bad, and all kinds of different things that the child is subjected to. It's really not about what's best for the child. It's about the parent venting their behavior, badgering the child, trying to manipulate them to change. But the child begins to tune them out. And after a while, as soon as mom or dad start their rant, their eyes glaze over, and it just hardens their heart even more. It creates a rebellion and a defiance that goes deeper and deeper each time. Some families, the punishment doesn't fit the crime. a kid is five minutes late on a curfew for the very first time and they get grounded for a month. Or, the punishment goes on and on and on. the design of a healthy consequence is a punishment that is designed to be fair and bring the child back in, and once it's resolved, everything is restored. In complex trauma and unhealthy families, the parent might want to punish you until the parent feels you've learned your lesson. they might give you the silent treatment. They might withhold love from you because in their mind, you deserve it. And they're going to make you stay in that doghouse for quite a while. And it does not fit the crime. It doesn't. It isn't concerned with what's best for the child. those are some of the things that complex trauma families do. Another characteristic of the child and the other characteristic of complex trauma families when it comes to boundaries is, is a lot of boundaries are set when the parent is angry. they're reactive rules. a child or the family has a great big fight and there's all kinds of fighting amongst the siblings, etc. And dad is angry and he might say, from now on, we're going to have supper together every night.",

Or a child is late, I just said, and they get grounded for a month. Again, what I've seen over the years with that kind of reactive rule setting or boundary setting is it might be enforced for a week or , but then it just gradually drifts back to the way it was. It wasn't a thought-out boundary. It was something that was carefully weighed out as to whether it was fair, whether they could continue to enforce it over time. It was just a reaction. And what can happen with children who have lots of that kind of stuff is after a while, when a reactive boundary is set, they go, oh , in a couple weeks they'll just be back, it's not a big deal. And it means nothing to them. Another thing that can happen is no doesn't mean no. Saying no to somebody is setting a boundary. But what can happen in a complex trauma family is a child can put a sign on their door and saying, this is my room, please keep out. This is my journal, my diary, please don't read it. And to the parents, they don't respect that. They just barge in whenever they want. They never ask permission. They step over the child's no. a no doesn't mean no. And that for many people, can really do a lot of damage. Because the child realizes that they are not respected, and they realize that they are never allowed to set boundaries with their parents. And if they try to set a boundary with a parent, they're made to feel guilty that they've done something wrong. the unspoken rule of those families is you can set boundaries with everybody else, but never with your parents. that does a lot of damage. let me give you another example where I kind of take your past and put it into your parenting today. It is very important for parents today when you say no to a child and you set a boundary, that you mean it.",

Whereas the child might actually be trying to be healthy, they are made to feel the scapegoat. And those pressures are brought against the child to try to force them to change. The parents are the ones who will make the child the problem child. Parents might even recruit other relatives and friends to go and talk to the child because of that. Another thing is children become afraid to say no. if they say no and then it's stepped over, or they get punished, or they're always put down, they might become a people pleaser. And they are afraid that everybody will reject them and they say yes to everybody because they don't want anybody mad at them and they're afraid if they set a boundary people will be mad at them. And that sets them up to let other people use them, take advantage of them, because they're afraid to say no. And then for many children who aren't allowed to set boundaries, the only way they can get some space or create a boundary is through anger or isolation. they just move away from everybody and hide out in their room or they explode and scare everybody off. Those are the only tools they have to try to create a safe bubble for themselves. Another thing that can happen is that children in complex trauma often the only way they can set a boundary outside of anger and isolation is if they try to set a boundary they have to close their heart. They have to be mad at that person, they have to hate that person, they have to want nothing to do with that person. the only way they have the strength to enforce a boundary is to close their heart to a person. As soon as they open their heart a bit then they let everybody do whatever they want again and they find that as their only solution. Then they have another issue that comes up. And what I'm hoping you're seeing is there's lots of issues that come out of complex trauma around this boundary thing that makes it very, very difficult for people to get healthy today.

And I don't want to be a victim of disrespect. I don't want to be a victim of disrespect. I don't want to be a victim of disrespect. I don't want to be a victim of disrespect. Disrespect hurts a lot. Disrespect spits on my value. It says I'm a zero. It is pouring salt in a wound. Disrespect is a very, very painful emotion because it's a statement about my identity that's very negative. for children growing up in complex trauma, disrespect can be verbal, but disrespect can also be how people treat me. They don't see me. They don't hear me. They ignore me. All of those disrespect, disrespect, disrespect, it is painful. And what happens when a child's in an environment where they're experiencing disrespect every day, that's complex trauma, is the child begins to do a couple things. Number one, they believe that everybody looks down on them. Everybody sees them through the eyes of disrespect. They assume that now. Secondly, that then means when they go into relationships, they read disrespect into situations where there's no disrespect at all. let me give you an example. I was teaching at a seminar, and afterwards, people come up and talk to me and ask me questions. And there was a line of people waiting to talk to me, and there's a person talking to me. All of a sudden, this person came up, and they tried to butt in front of the line, and they tried to interrupt the person who was talking to me, and they wanted to talk to me. And they wanted to talk to me. And they wanted to talk to me.",

I'm talking to this person, and I'll get to you very shortly. That person left in a huff. That person said to their friend, he just treated me with great disrespect. All I did was set a respectful boundary. But because of all of the disrespect they had experienced all their life, they now read disrespect into me setting a respect. And I said, I'm going to talk to you now. that is what happens all of the time with children coming out of complex trauma. But then it does a third thing. Now, if I sense disrespect, there's a powerful, intense reaction to stop it, to fight back. And if I sensed respect, it could be true disrespect, or it could be disrespect that I read into situations where it's not even there. Now, I am going to talk to this person, and I am going to lash out. I am going to get angry. I am going to disrespect the other person. I am going to do all I can to hurt them worse than they're hurting me. shame creates this powerful reaction every time that disrespect thing gets triggered. And wow, that can do a ton of damage in relationships to children, to partners, to friends. That is the problem with this hypersensitivity. To disrespect, you read it in to where it's not even there, and then you overreact and do a ton of damage. That leads to the next one. Shame also is hypersensitive to criticism. these are connected. But a child where shame develops is often been criticized verbally by being made to feel they aren't good enough, by not being seen, by not being heard, by being laughed at, by being teased, all kinds of different things. Many children. Many children grew up in families where it didn't matter how they did, how hard they tried, it never was good enough. Their parents always found something to criticize about it. They always came up short. Now, most of us, if I know I have done something wrong that violates love, I can accept criticism because I know it's designed to help me.",

It feels I can't win. It causes deep pain. It's very discouraging. And again, criticism disrespect hurts a ton. And we develop this powerful reaction every time we sense that it's coming. Because what criticism is doing is exposing our shame. It is putting out for all to see how bad we fear we are. And people, when they sense that criticism is coming, they can overreact. They can get very angry. They can lash out because they never want to look bad again. The problem is, is that they redefine what is a criticism. , whenever, somebody gives them a different opinion, they, they, you're criticizing me. No, I'm giving you a different opinion. Whenever somebody gives you feedback in a situation, you're criticizing me. You're trying to make me look stupid. Whenever somebody points out a legitimate mistake that you've made, you're criticizing me. When somebody's trying to even be helpful in a situation, you're criticizing me. And what begins to happen is they go, they develop a belief that, for you to not criticize me, means that you must never disagree with me. It means that you must never call me on my stuff. Even when I am doing stuff that violates love, that's clearly wrong. In other words, if you're not totally for me and agree with me a hundred percent, then you're against me. Loyalty means that you will never criticize me. That's how they begin to frame it. That's how deep their shame is that they can't look at themselves honestly. They can have others look at them honestly. They can't see any of that. They can't believe their flaws. They can't get any other opinions or help. They must be a hundred percent all the time, never challenged. That basically moves people into narcissistic, distorted thinking, and that does much damage in relationships. The next one is what happens with shame is image becomes more important than reality. what. Shame believes, and concludes, is that if people get to know the authentic me, they will never love me and accept me and respect me.",

And then what happens if the things that I turn to try to make me feel secure, to try to make me feel important my body, my job, my money, my possessions. What happens if something threatens them. I get older and I start losing my looks and I start losing my body and my feelings. Or I come up to retirement and I'm going to lose my job. Insecurity, insecurity, insecurity. shame produces many insecurities. Insecurities about every aspect of you that has been criticized, made fun of, that you've rejected and hated about yourself. Things that you've built to try to build security in your life but are actually things that could be threatened. All of those things are things that you've built to try to build security in your life. Cause a person to have deeper insecurity. But there's a second piece that comes out of complex trauma. What is it that causes a child to feel security. It's not just having a secure external environment. It's having a rock to firmly connect to. Mom and dad who are safe, who are reliable, who are trustworthy. When a child has a rock, they can have an external world that's not totally secure, but they still feel secure because they're not going to be able to feel secure. They're connected to the rock. what happens if you can't connect. You feel insecure all the time. Complex trauma produces insecurity at that level as. Then if they have a major failure in their life, they work away at something and fail. That creates insecurities. Then if they're abandoned, that creates deep, deep insecurities. they can get insecurity from all kinds of different sources. That comes out of shame and complex trauma. The final one is they promise more than they can deliver. shame basically says that people won't love me and respect me for who I am, just the way I am. The only way they'll respect me is if I seem bigger than I am.",

You don't have to meet all 18, but you got to meet at least half of them,. here we go. A narcissist, if you don't know what a narcissist, where it comes from, let me quickly give you the back story. It comes from a Greek myth. back in a long time ago in Greece, before there were ever mirrors, you never saw a reflection of yourself. And one day this guy named Narcissus, he goes out to get a drink of water at the pond and it's nice and calm that day and the sun's shining just and he looks into the pond to get a drink of water and he sees his reflection. And he goes, that is the handsomest guy I've ever seen in my life. I fall in love with you. I'm coming back every day just to look at myself and admire myself and how beautiful I am. That's where narcissism came from. That's the idea,. number one, they believe they are special and unique, which means they think they're a little bit better than everybody else. But the reason we say they think they're special is they think they're special because they're not. They think they're special because they're not. They think they can only be understood by special people. what that means is if you call them on your stuff, they have a comeback that says, you don't get me because you're not special. Only the people understand my greatness. they have that system in their mind. Second thing, deep down, they may not say it, they might say it, but they do believe they are more important than other people. That they're smarter, more capable, better in every category almost. Next, they exaggerate their achievements. they didn't just catch a fish this big, they catch a fish this big,. you get that kind of exaggeration that takes place. And they expect to be recognized by you as being better than you. they expect you to look up to them and kind of say, I'm going to be a better person than you.",

Then arrogance, or they're just, their nose is a little bit in the air, a bit of snobbishness is there. Now, have you been in a relationship with a narcissist. You'll understand this next one. They must never be wrong. Because their image says they always have to be. if you are in a conflict with a narcissist, they will never admit they're wrong. They will never admit they're wrong, but rather, they will take what happened and twist it to make you wrong. And they will take what you say and twist it to make you wrong. what I say to people, don't argue with a narcissist, because the more you try to convince them of your truth, the more they're going to twist what you say and use it against you. Because they must never be wrong. And then, at first, a narcissist can act very caring. But as their true colors come out, you find they don't really have much empathy or care for other people's needs or feelings at all. Rather, their, it's all about me, causes them to feel very entitled. That you owe me special treatment. You have to meet all of my needs. I don't have to meet any of your needs. a relationship with a narcissist is never giving 50-50. It's always lopsided. You're doing the majority of the giving, they're doing all the getting. And that is their sense of entitlement. Then, they don't think rules apply to them. they live by a double standard. Rules apply to you, but not to me. I can go through your phone, you can't go through mine. rules don't apply to them. They're the exception in their mind to every rule. What I mean by they're exploitive of others is this. Narcissists are all about manipulating you to meet their needs. Narcissists don't know how to love people, they just know how to use people. Now in their minds, they're being loving.

Now to help you understand that, when a person has a lot of shame deep down that they've never acknowledged, they're pretty sure that if people get to know them, nobody will ever want to meet their needs. the only way they can get their needs met is not to express them, but to learn how to manipulate people to meet them. And , narcissists become master manipulators. They can get good at manipulating, sometimes you're not even aware that they're manipulating you. Usually there's always a hidden agenda that's happening when you're working with a narcissist, and when you first meet a narcissist and they say, tell me about yourself, and you pour out your heart, and tell them everything about yourself, guess what they're doing. They're taking notes. Oh , here's where I can manipulate them. I got their hot button. Now I know what to use if I want to get something badly. They're taking notes on you. They must feel control, and they must always get what they want. Now this is important to understand from this perspective. Narcissists can be the sweetest, nicest people in the world 99 of the time, until they don't get what they want. And then you got World War III. They explode, and there is to pay to anybody who has crossed them. what I'm saying is this. Narcissists can act very healthy until they're triggered. And it's those triggers that reveal their true colors. They can no longer hide their deeper stuff once they get triggered. The masks come away, and they come out. some of the main triggers for a narcissist are perceived rejection. if you reject them or say no to them, watch out. Not getting what they want, not getting enough attention. You're not feeding me enough. Or anything that messes with their image. what happens if they don't get what they want, or they get triggered. Usually they go to anger, and then they get cruel, abusive, they lash out, they say extremely hurtful things, and they can be very destructive.",

We've talked about the house of mirrors. if you went into the Red River X with the distorted mirrors and you're six feet tall and thin, but you look in the mirror and you're four feet tall and four feet tall, and you're four feet wide, that's a distorted mirror.

And you may have heard things that growing up. And you've bought into that. Or with that, I don't deserve a good life. And that is one of the reasons why people sabotage when good things start to happen. Because deep, deep down, they don't believe they deserve it. Another lie that suddenly comes out of all of this is, I figure because I'm such a screw up, I will eventually fail at everything in my life. Therefore, I might as mess it up now. And that's part of the sabotage. But I want you to see the subtlety of that shame lie is, I'm pretty sure I'll fail at everything. I might as get it over with. Next one. And this now goes into a street level of shame. A street level of thinking, but it's how shame distorts respect. if you criticize me in any way, you are rejecting me. Or you think I'm worse than you. If you question my ideas, you think I'm stupid. what does it mean to show respect on a street level. You have to agree with me about everything I say. You can never challenge me. You can never criticize me. If you do, you're disrespecting me. If you ever offer me advice or challenge something that I've said and offer me a better solution, you're disrespecting me. That is shame. And shame is believing, the only way I can believe I have value is if everybody around me are yes men. They agree with everything I do, they never confront me, never hold me accountable. If they do, then they are disrespecting me. Next one, and this is a very subtle one too. People who are nice to me are probably saying bad things behind my back. Some of you may deep down believe that. Next one. Deep down, I think that everyone I get close to will eventually abandon me.

If I spend time relaxing or doing something that interests me, I am being selfish. some of you were raised that in such a way that if you relax, you feel guilty. If you take an afternoon off just to do stuff you enjoy, you are being selfish and you feel guilty for that. Next one, very subtle. No one will ever love me unconditionally. People may love me, but there's usually always a string attached somewhere. And that comes out of shame. And you're suspicious of all love and can't allow yourself to receive it because you can't believe it would ever be genuine. Next one. I should be happy with a relationship that gives me a few crumbs of love that's probably the best I can get. Again, shame working itself out. those are just some of the lies that come out of shame. And what I want you to understand is you may have been operating by those lies without even realizing it. And the whole point of what this exercise tonight has been is you can't change something until you become aware of it. But with shame, most of it operates at a subconscious level. I can't deal with shame until I grow in self-awareness about how shame has affected me and how it works out in all kinds of subtle ways. I'm not doing this to discourage you, to make you feel overwhelmed with how screwed up you are, though you might be feeling that. I am doing this you become aware of all the subtle intricacies of shame in your life. Because only as you are aware can you begin to change those lies and replace them with the truth.

I hope it has given you some hope but also greater self-awareness. Next week we'll start getting into the tools to heal those hearts. for the part tonight, I thought what I would do is talk about what are some of the tools that has given us to heal our hearts. What are some of the truths that says about who we are. let's get the most accurate mirror in the world, let's take a look at that and see what He says about who we are. And let that become the beginning, the framework of how we rebuild an accurate self-identity. And that is, I think, the most important thing. Because if I was to say you're a great person, you go, who are you. You don't know me. But if knows everything about me and every secret I have and even stuff I don't even know about myself, what does He still say about me. there is somebody I can rely on what they say as being accurate and truthful. And does actually say quite a bit about us. And I wanna develop it and show it to you. And hopefully you can begin to either memorize it, but make that part of your identity and your understanding. Romans 8 says this. You have not received a spirit that makes you fearful slaves. Instead, you received 's spirit when he adopted you as his own children. Now we call him Abba. And that word Abba is just an Aramaic word from that time, which was how a child said daddy. it was the most intimate child expression, papa, daddy. For his spirit joins with our spirit to affirm that we are 's children. And since we're his children, we're his heirs. What's significant about that is that doesn't just bring us into a relationship where we sit in the waiting room and wait for the appointment once in a while. No. If you got the president of the United States, we won't talk about him, but the prime minister of Canada, and you might have all these people waiting in line to talk to him, but if his kid wants to talk to him, he's got first access.",

He desires for us to feel safe enough with him and close enough to him that we can call him daddy or an intimate, trusting expression. And he's with us, he says, I'm going to make you the heirs of everything I have. you don't just do that for some jerk. You do that for somebody. You are invested in and have in. that's the starting point. Romans 15 says, Accept each other just as has accepted you. what is he saying. Accept each other unconditionally. Warts and all. Failures. That's how accepted us. What is that saying. He is the only person who has totally unconditionally accepted us, for who we are, body, soul, personality, emotional makeup, intellectual makeup. He designed us. He accepts us. We don't have to fear rejection or criticism from him about ourselves. That kind of acceptance doesn't exist in very many places, but it does exist with. Third one.

You might have had parents who had different trinkets and toys, but you knew that certain things were special possessions and you didn't mess with those things. Or you knew that other kids come to your house and play and mom and dad would give them attention, but when they looked, they looked at you, there was a twinkle in their eye that wasn't there for other kids. There was an excitement and a pride that you were their kid. And that's what he is saying is you are not 's trinket that he puts on the back of a shelf to collect dust because it has no value. You are a treasured, special possession that gets very special treatment. A very important truth. Next one. See how very much our Father loves us.

I got to let go of this thing, the unhealthy parts. And I have to find healthy. let me explain that. several aspects that come out of complex trauma. number one, we connect to things that aren't healthy. we have said over and over again that the greatest drive that a child is born with is to connect, to attach. Because a child can't meet any of their own needs. the only way they're going to survive and get their needs met is if they attach to somebody who can meet their needs. The bottom line with complex trauma is a child tries to connect with mom and dad or caregivers. But they're either too busy, too involved in their own issues, don't care, don't know how to meet the child's needs, don't know how to connect, don't know how to be present. And the child is not able to connect with those people. That then puts the child in a dilemma. Because they need to connect. They're driven to connect. if they can't connect with their caregivers, they will connect with something. here's kind of how it plays out in general terms. The first thing that the child will try to do is they still want to connect with mom and dad. And they'll use two methods to try and connect with mom and dad. If mom and dad won't connect with me when I'm authentic, they must find something wrong with me. Something that's my fault that causes them not to want to connect with me. Something that's my fault that causes them not to want to connect with me. Something that's my fault that causes them not to want to connect with me. that's a shame message. therefore, I will learn to fawn. I will learn to be what they want me to be. I will learn to read them, their needs, their priorities, their beliefs. And I will become what they want that then they will connect with me. I will become a people pleaser.",

And again, many of them have a mix of healthy and unhealthy. a child who might be naturally funny and that gets validation from their parents might just conclude they need to be funny all the time. Or a child might conclude that to stay safe, they have to always be in control. And they work to become control of everything and everybody. Or if they're going to survive and get their needs met, they need to be a people pleaser. They need to learn to read the room, read people, read their values, read their priorities, read their needs, take care of them first. Hopefully then the person will them and give them what they want. Some, they go, if I'm just a martyr all the time, poor me, life is hard. Then people feel sorry for me. People take care of me. they adapt and begin to do that. Others, they go to lying as a way to survive. And lying becomes their adaptation. Others go to, I'm not going to trust anybody. Everybody stabbed me in the back, betrayed me, let me down. Don't trust anyone. That's their adaptation. Others live with constant anxiety because there's always been danger around them. their adaptation in the brain is just to be constantly on guard, hypervigilant, always having a bit of anxiety. Others develop a strong inner critic where you're constantly judging yourself. And then others develop a critic that turns outward where you're looking at everything, finding fault with everything, being negative and critical of everything. That's your way of surviving. That's your adaptations. Others go to, I will be a flirt. I will be very sexual. I will have a perfect body. Very sexual. I will try to be the most desired person in the room.

That's their adaptations. Others go, I will suppress anxiety. I will suppress anxiety. I will suppress every negative emotion. I will deny my feelings. I will minimize my pain. In other words, I am going to use my brain to make everything go away that I don't feel. I will become a head, a brain on legs minus feelings. Others take their brain and the adaptation of the brain too. I will overthink everything. If I don't have a brain, I will overthink everything. I can figure everything out. Analyze everything to death. Then if I can figure everything out, then I can solve everything. And I'll fix all my problems just by thinking. And that's their adaptation. Others go, I will become invisible. I will have no needs. I will never make demands. I will never put myself out there. That way I'll never get hurt. I will never be a burden to anybody. Nobody will resent me. Others, I will be super compliant to a religious organization, to a group, and do whatever they want.

Their template for relationships is emotionally unavailable people. And what does the child do in their mind. They go, it must be my fault that my parents aren't attaching to me, that they're not available to me. the challenge then for the child is, I bet you I can figure out how to get them to attach. they continue to go. If I try this, maybe my parents will be available to me. If I try this, if I please them in this way, then they will want to be available to me. They place all the responsibility on themselves. But the key is that emotionally unavailable people become their norm. when they get to adult life, two things happen. When they meet an emotionally unavailable person, it feels normal. And they're actually attracted. They're attracted to it. But then part of them still is, I couldn't get mom and dad to attach to me. But now the challenge is all over again, what if I can get this person to attach to me. Let's try all of the different things. This now gives me energy that I want to try to get them to attach. Then there's another piece to this. And that is if they meet somebody and there is a very intense, feeling of connection. Oh, we're close. There's a chemistry. It's not real true intimacy.

Number one is cortisol, which then releases adrenaline. And that gives you energy to fight or flight. We got to get out of here or we got to fight this thing. Because that's our only way of survival. Then it releases a second thing called oxytocin. And if you're a woman and had a baby, you probably have heard of oxytocin. Oxytocin is the love connection chemical. It's what makes you after labor. And this child just tears you apart and causes you more pain than you've ever had in your life. Instead of wanting to kill them, you want to hug them. That's oxytocin. You can thank for that. Because now it just says, I love you. I want to connect with you. I don't care about how much pain you just caused me. I just want to connect.

Some even have experienced where their anger, they quickly go to a black rage. And what happens is that they're going to get a black rage. And what happens is that they're going to get a black rage. And what I mean by that is they're not, it's almost they lose consciousness of what is happening. They just get consumed by their anger that later they don't even remember what they did. It's they have a blackout regarding what happens in those moments. And that's a scary thing for them because they don't know what they did or who they hurt.",

    "output": "To get through the day. Others, anger becomes a bit of a shield. A radar system. A protective guard. the fear is when you live in danger, if I drop my guard, something bad will happen that I didn't see coming. What children learn is if I stay angry, I stay on guard. I don't drop my guard when I'm angry. let's stay angry because then I'll never drop my guard. I'll never get hurt. Then what people find is, when they're angry, their natural response is two things. They become self-righteous. They always feel and that feels good. Secondly, they always blame somebody else for their anger. It's their fault that I'm angry. And it gets the attention off of me. It gets the focus on others. It keeps me from having to look at myself honestly. I've always got to be honest. I've always got somebody else to blame. anger is an important tool in denying the real issues. In feeling good about myself instead of guilt and shame. I hope what you begin to realize is children coming out of complex trauma, they started with the use of anger. That got shut down. Then they developed all of these unhealthy uses of anger. recovery is going to require, relearning anger. Relearning that there's healthy anger. Relearning not to feel guilty about that. To learn to express that in healthy ways. To learn to manage that. To give up all of the unhealthy ways of anger. There are a lot of tools there. That's a big challenge. But it is an important part of growth and recovery. Because this anger thing, usually we end up damaging it. We end up damaging those we love the most. And that's why we want to grow in this area. Is to stop doing damage in intimate relationships.",

And then with a controlling type narcissistic mother, you weren't allowed to set boundaries. You weren't allowed to voice your opinion. And you struggle now with all of that. Or you weren't allowed to display certain emotions. That was considered not ladylike. To be angry, to express too much enthusiasm. You had to be very stoic, controlled. And you struggle now a lot with emotions. And then you might find you just really mistrust females. That you might have good relationships with men, but women, not women, that's a cat fight waiting to happen. And you don't feel safe with females. Some, you just start to feel disconnected from playfulness. Because women had to be constantly busy in the home, doing work, accomplishing stuff. They just couldn't sit around. They just couldn't relax. They couldn't have fun. That was very much criticized. Some become very disconnected from their own, natural nurturing energy. They've got much anger. They've got much distrust. They've had to fit into this mold that they lose who they are. They disconnect from those very important things inside of them. I don't know how that affects you. I think for some of you, you're going, you just described my life. And it's quite painful. Where do we go from here. How do we heal. How do we heal. How do we heal. I think it's hard to go from here. How do we heal mummy and daddy wounds, which pretty everybody has, some are deeper than others. And to me, it's realizing that there's degrees to the wound, but usually some of the deepest wounds that we have were inflicted by mum and dad. That's why they're hard to deal with. in our life today, that complicates it even more. But these are our deepest wounds. And we may not go to them away in our recovery, but eventually we're going to get to them.",

There are no perfect parents. The term that has developed is good enough parents. What does a child want in a parent. The child wants a parent who is present and wants to connect with them regularly. They want a parent who's humble, a parent who's willing to learn, a parent who's willing to admit their mistakes, a parent who's always growing and wanting to change. They want a parent who hears the child, sees the child, values the child just as much as they want the child to value and hear them. it's not a double standard. It's a mutual. And they want a parent who, when there's damage, works hard to repair it. And is willing to own their stuff. Let me say this as. All of us as parents have regrets. Nobody's a perfect parent. We live with guilt. We live with regrets. We can't go back and redo some of this stuff. we have to forgive ourself, accept that, but be willing to keep changing today. I can't go back and redo it, but man, I can make sure I don't recommit that today. I'm going to keep working on myself. And if our kids see it, they're going to say, And if our kids see it, they're going to say, And if our kids see it, they're going to say, Yes, continuing to grow and change, it affects them. They now feel we're safer than they used to be. They now feel, wow, maybe I want to reconnect with them. again, let me end with this bottom line. Being a good parent is not about just doing techniques. Being a good parent is getting healthy in every area of my life. Going through the process of continuing to grow. Owning my stuff. That's the greatest gift we can give to our children, is to do that. , I hope this is very helpful for you. For the children with mommy-daddy wounds and issues. For the parents who live with the guilt and struggle with facing some of the damage that they've done. We all can heal and grow. And I hope this will help you do that. Hi again.",

    "output": "It puts you into this situation where you go, I don't this feeling. It feels just bad. what, let's sabotage it all and go back to what feels normal. What feels comfortable. There's another reason people sabotage and that's guilt. I've dealt with many clients who their life starts succeeding and they go, I don't deserve this good life because of the bad stuff I've done. I need to sabotage all that's going. I go back to failing because that's what I deserve. sabotage becomes part of complex trauma because there's many fears that come out of the different ways that we live. And part of recovery is realizing, becoming aware of the times when my impulse to sabotage kicks in. And often it could start subconsciously, but I become aware of it and I go, whoa, I'm not going to sabotage here. I am going to trust the process and I'm going to get out of my limbic brain, get back into my cortex and stick with the plan. And that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to get out of my limbic brain. I'm going to get back into my cortex. I'm going to get back into my brain. And it's really a very strong plan and they become very thankful that they did. The next fear is fear of conflict. Most people from complex trauma don't deal with conflict. They hate conflict. in a healthy home, conflict, you realize conflict is part of every relationship. You don't always agree. You misunderstand each other. You have different tastes and preferences. You do things sometimes accidentally that hurt each other. conflict becomes. part of normal relationships, but what happens is the goal is we want to resolve it. We want to grow from this. Both of us want to grow. We want this to turn into improving our relationship, fixing a problem. you work at it with respect. You work at it out of love. You work at it with a desire to grow, and that's what happens. conflict turns into a very positive growth thing, not in complex trauma. Nothing good comes out of conflict in complex trauma. There's always going to be a winner and a loser, and the person who wins is going to punish the people who lose. you're not only going to lose the argument, you are going to get then shamed.",

And for many people, conflict is a bad thing. It is a bad thing. It is a bad thing. It is a bad thing. coming out of complex trauma, conflict to them is to be avoided at all costs. their commitment is keep the peace, never rock the boat, take care of the other person's emotions if they're starting to get a little upset that it doesn't result in conflict. do whatever they want to make them happy that they don't get mad. Tell lies, deny problems, sweep stuff under the rug, stick your head in the sand, just agree with who's ever in power, be a yes man, avoid conflict, conform to whatever rules and expectations they have to keep them happy. That's the only way to have peace. That's the only way to have any chance of happiness. Now that gives short-term truces but doesn't give true peace because you never feel safe. You can't be happy. You can't be authentic. You're not fully accepted and it doesn't truly work. in recovery, I have found for many people coming out of complex trauma that learning to enter into conflict, learning to do conflict is scary but once they start to experience it and learn the tools and see the benefits that come out of healthy conflict, they're going to be able to do a very important part of their growth. Now this is connected to the next fear. People coming out of complex trauma have a fear of angry people. an angry person to them is a person who is dysregulated and therefore has great difficulty controlling themselves. They're angry they have a powerful impulse that they cannot control to lash out and hurt people and some people are very angry. they're very angry. And there's each this Nightfall.",

But you'relik этот again, when they're angry, they forget all about those boundaries. They walk all over the boundaries they've set for themselves. And then when they're angry, if you try to set a boundary and say, you said you would never do this or stay out of my room, they do not respect your boundaries. an angry person loses all their filters, loses their ability to have internal boundaries and stick to them and does not respect the boundaries of others. And then they realized if you try to reason with somebody when they're angry, they can't be reasoned with because they're totally in their limbic brain with cortisol pumping and they are irrational. an angry person, you cannot resolve it. You cannot. Help them. You cannot help yourself. the only solution is stay away. Stay out of their way. Get as far as you can away from an angry person. today for many people coming out of complex trauma, when they see somebody angry, they immediately go into high alert. They immediately go into a strong desire to flight, to flee, to avoid this angry person. It is a powerful, important, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful. that's what their brain has concluded after years of seeing the damage that angry persons do. Now let's go on to the next fear. And it's the fear of losing what gives them value. we saw that shame results in trying to get value from the wrong things. your body, your possessions, your brains, your money, all of those things. here's what happens. think of a woman who's who's got her sense of value from her looks, her beauty and her body. And that's got her tons of respect. She's been able to get her needs met because of that. She gets what feels love often because of that.",

All my value comes out of the externals of my life. To I have value. If I lose my looks. If I have an accident. If the economy crashes and I lose my money. I can get through that. I'm still valuable.

    "output": ", welcome to another Friday night. We've been doing a little mini-series within our reparenting series on some of the lies that we believe, without even realizing it, that come out of either culture or complex trauma. And they actually set us up for a lot of things to fail in adult life. And part of recovery and reparenting is beginning to identify these lies that exist in our subconscious and begin to change them and actually believe the truth. today I want to look at some of the lies that come out of our culture and come out of complex trauma regarding dating and intimate relationships. And many of them are subtle because they're just culturally believed. They're culturally out there. They're in movies. We hear them in songs all the time. And they're just presented as if they're in a movie. And they're presented as if they're in a movie. And they're just presented as if they're in a movie. And they're presented as if they're in a movie. And they're just presented as if they're in a movie. And they're the truth. let me get into these lies. I hope it really helps you begin to think more clearly about some stuff about relationships. number one is it's common. Being in a relationship will fix my loneliness problems. And we've done a video recently on loneliness. And what I want people to realize is loneliness can be experienced within a relationship. Loneliness isn't about a relationship. It's about connection. And if I don't know how to connect in a secure, healthy way, I will be lonely even in a relationship. And yes, if I am lonely, yes, if I have the tools to connect, a relationship will be a helpful thing. But if I'm lonely and I don't have tools to connect, the relationship isn't going to help. It's actually going to make things worse. And the key piece is I got to learn to connect first with myself. Because somewhere in complex trauma, because of not being able to connect securely with mom and dad and others, I kind of abandon myself as and don't connect with myself. I just try to get out of my own skin and distract from my own feelings and thoughts. I need to learn connection.",

They can, we did just that because we're, if they're trustworthy, if their commitment to me is solid. And I feel some insecurity. That's normal. That takes time for living with a person who consistently lives out commitment and trustworthiness where that insecurity disappears. And I just have a confidence that, hey, they can talk to other people, but I know they're, we're solid. what happens though with a person with complex trauma is that they have this deep shame that basically believes that everybody, once they get to know me, is going to leave me eventually. now when they get in a relationship, they're pretty sure you're going to leave them. their jealousy now is not based on your behavior. It's based on their undealt with shame. now you talk to anybody and they're going to leave me, see they're cheating on me and they blame it on you, but it's their shame that's the issue. But they don't want to look at that. they're not willing to look at their true issues. They're not willing to sit in the discomfort of that initial insecurity and unknown in a relationship. As I get to know a person, as they prove their trustworthiness, I'm not willing to sit in those uncomfortable emotions. I try to make you responsible for those emotions and to take them away. And now I blame you for those emotions. Instead of either acknowledging that either, hey, this is the normal part of the early days of a relationship, or this is actually my shame, I try to control you. That's where most jealousy comes from.

    "output": "many people with complex trauma have a low-grade depression. There's just constantly a sadness that is there. I think it's important to understand that I think complex trauma contributes to depression in a bunch of different ways. we tend to think of depression, we kind of just put it in a general box. You're depressed. There must be a chemical imbalance in the brain. That could be true. But I think complex trauma helps us realize there's other factors that feed depression besides just chemical imbalance in the brain. think first of all of a child, what we talked about at the beginning, where your emotions basically exist in a negative environment. You constantly are feeling pain. You can't resolve. That pain is getting worse. Your needs aren't being met. You feel empty. You can't connect. There's all kinds of negative emotions that just grow, grow, grow. Then your circumstances, there's constant danger. There's constant stress. your circumstances feed these negative emotions. the negative of your life far outweighs the positives. That just takes its toll. That gradually grinds you into deeper and deeper depression. But there's something else. When a child is in complex trauma, they're constantly in danger or precarious. They're in perceived danger. they're in their sympathetic nervous system all the time. Their parasympathetic nervous system, whose purpose is to provide rest and healing and balance to your nervous system that you don't burn out, isn't allowed to kick in. And your go, go, go survival mode, energy mode without the necessary rest and healing. Over time, you're heading towards burnout. What we realize is that sometimes depression kicks in as a way to try and get you out of your sympathetic nervous system into your parasympathetic nervous system. It's trying to protect you from totally burning out. Another thing is this. When you're stuffing emotions all the time, it's trying to hold a beach ball. Under the water, it takes a lot of emotional energy to hold down anger, to hold down fear, to hold down all the guilt that you feel, to hold down all of the different emotions that you feel. You repress, repress, repress, and you just get exhausted emotionally. And that can result in depression. Dissociation is another element here that leads to depression. trauma, if it's trauma, it's a lot of stress. It's a lot of stress. severe.",

    "output": "The brain's way of protecting is to retreat to an internal world, to dissociate from the present. And often what it's saying is my nervous system is overwhelmed from this trauma. I need a way to escape my nervous system. And depression becomes a way to help a person escape living within their nervous system that is overwhelmed. Then there's another thing. What happens with shame is I don't myself. I hate myself. I'm angry at myself. I'm critical of myself. anger turns inward. And anger turned inward can lead to depression. And then, sadly for many people, depression has been their normal since they were little kids. Every day sucked. Every day they were in their sympathetic mode. But the idea of what loss really actually happens is that time as we leave our neural positive system is dropped into depression and we become addicted to emotion and shit.

Again, just understand that what's happening every time a person in addiction starts to come down and feel crappy is their brain goes, we need to go back and take another hit of the drug, and that'll fix everything. And when a person is in this cycle with an abuser, and every time the tension is starting to build, and there's fear developing, and their needs are not being met, and it feels crappy, their brain is saying, I need to go back to the abuser because they're the only ones who can fix this. The next piece to understanding trauma bonding is understanding the gaslighting element and indoctrination. if you look at a child in complex trauma, there's a huge gaslighting indoctrination component to their upbringing. when their parent is mad, their parent says to the child, it's your fault. Now that's gaslighting. It's not the child's fault. It's the parent's fault. The parent then makes the child think they need to put, their needs aside, make their parent's needs all important, that they need to conform to the rules that the parent has set, even though the child's gut says this isn't , this isn't fair. They need to do whatever the parent says. They need to let the parent think for them. They need to distrust their own thinking, their own emotions, their own gut. And they need to give their parents total weight in their life, total control of their life. They need to be totally dependent on their parents. parents for everything. That's part of the indoctrination. the parents get rid of critical thinking. They get you to distrust your emotions, your gut, and depend totally on them. That's what happens in adult relationships. The abuser tries to recreate that type of dependence. they gaslight you. They indoctrinate you. They begin to get you to not trust yourself. But here's where they have to begin, by getting you totally dependent on them. And they will say, you don't need your parents. Your parents are a bad influence. Your parents are sick.

Conforming is the recipe to happy relationships, doing what the other person wants. that means I need to lose myself, make myself small, put my needs aside, serve their needs, be attuned to their needs. That's the recipe for a healthy relationship. what you're seeing is that the child is beginning to believe that fawning is the correct ingredient, the only ingredient for a healthy relationship. I must be small. They must be big. I must please them. However possible. It goes further. If they're upset, if they're mad, if they abuse me, it's my fault. I've done something wrong to upset them.

    "output": "I've been thinking about two words that are often used, surviving versus thriving, or existing versus living. And when we talk about trauma, we talk about existing, surviving, being in survival mode. What we want people to do in recovery is to thrive, to learn to truly live, not just exist. And that's my desire for everybody when they come into recovery from trauma, is that they'll be able to move from this survival mode, just existing, to truly thriving. But it is a challenge for people from complex trauma. And that's what I just want to briefly talk about. But to give you a context on it, I've always enjoyed the fact that the Greek language has two words for life, bios, from which we get biology, and zoe. And understanding the difference between those two words really, I think, helps illustrate what I'm talking about. And I'm going to talk about the two words, I'm talking about. bios, from which we get biology, is one is physically alive. Their heart is pumping blood. Their lungs are taking in air. Their brain is functioning. They're physically alive. But I think all of us have had the experience of meeting somebody who's physically alive, has bios life. But you look into their eyes, and there's just a deadness there. There's an emptiness there. It's , it's blank. And you go, they're physically alive, but they're not alive. They might experience superficial pleasures in their life, but they're not deeply satisfied. They don't have true deep joy. And the pleasures they experience are just very fleeting. And they're always connected to just external stuff happening. It's not the result of a healthy internal life. bios is their existence, but they're not truly alive. And that takes us to the second word, zoe. And zoe means to be alive, not just physically, but to be alive internally, emotionally, spiritually. Your soul is healthy. Your soul is content. It means that in every aspect of their humanity, there's life, not just their body. they're fully human. Every aspect of their humanity, the needs are being met properly, and they are then thriving. They're alive. They feel a deep joy, contentment, and satisfaction. it's the result of their internal world being healthy and alive. somebody's contrasted it this way. bios, biological life. Zoe, spiritual soul life.",

The next thing that the brain comes up with is the only way people won't see my weakness is I have to be self-sufficient and never need anybody. I got to be able to handle every problem and never need anybody. I got to never depend on anybody else that I'm always strong and people always see how strong I am. They never see weakness or need. And some of you have tried that and that seems to work for a while, but life delivers problems at times that we cannot handle alone. those are some of the early solutions the brain comes up with to try to handle the problem. the first thing that the brain comes up with is the only way people will ever be able to handle the shame issue, the fear of abandonment, trying to hide but still get love and respect. Now I want to take that and I want to transfer that into how does that work itself out. I want you to think about shame and connection with people. one of the things that we talk about all the time is that our brain is wired with a need for connection. from birth, a baby desires to connect with mom and dad. It's built into us. When a baby's born, we desire as parents to connect with it. We have it driven for connection. As we get older, we long for a partner or a deep intimate relationship where we can connect at the deepest level. It is wired into us. , think of shame this way. Shame is the result of not being able to connect. what you might think of a time when you wanted to connect to mom or dad. Maybe you had a problem. Maybe you were hurting.",

I am no longer hungry. people are set up for opioid addictions, she is saying, because they didn't get connection in childhood. And many of you can relate to that. , then she takes it further. That's in part because of the striatum, which is our autopilot system. I talk about your default setting. , what it is saying is if you start putting opioids from chemicals, not from social interaction into your brain, it changes your brain's default setting. And the drug becomes the default state that keeps the pain at bay and the relief close, overriding the system that would otherwise prompt us to seek humanization. Her gripto talk that sometimes aside from the prevarication to bringing in substances epididymolast it has an alert set itself that motivates you to seek something based on your rang and down. , if you get an adult Sergey Zahle who's going through puberty in childhood, she's going to be strengthened by the production of new medications and they're going to have a Lebanese tax incentive. why is it that many addicts the more they use, the more they isolate. Because number one, medical detox and rehab. We're great at that. Number two, counseling and therapy. Both of those are thriving. What's missing. Number three, social connection. That's been ignored in our recovery world. Now she takes that even further,. The striatum is what gives us the source of hope here. your striatum is your default setting. what she's now going to say is this. Your striatum, which has been changed to now say, I don't need relationships, I just want drugs, it can be rewired. It can be reprogrammed by starting to give it deep social connections that it longed for in the first place. you can retrain it that it longs for deep social connections again. And if we do that, we need to practice social connections, not reactive behaviors instead of compulsive behaviors. It's not enough to just teach healthier responses to cues from our social reward system. In other words, it's not enough just to give people tools to cope. We have to rebuild the social reward system with reciprocal relationships to replace the drugs which relieve the craving.",

    "output": "Our culture and communities either create environments that are either full of things, or they're not. They're full of things that cause addictions to thrive, or full of things that cause relationships to thrive. I think that's powerfully, very said. But the problem, as I come to the end of that, is our culture today is programmed to make addictions thrive. And we, if we are going to help people change, we have to create subcultures which are countercultures, which reintroduce social connections. And that will reprogram the brain. And as the brain is reprogrammed, and people are getting meaningful social connections, the desire for the opioids disappears. And that, I think, is very significant. But here's the trick with shame. Shame says, I want to connect. But as soon as you say, I'm going to try and connect, fear comes up. And it says, -oh, what happens if they find out I'm not perfect. -oh, what happens if they find out who I really am. what you're doing in recovering from shame is saying, I will risk connecting by walking through the fear of being found out. And I will trust that if I connect with the people, it will help me to heal. But that is a scary step. , second thing. How does shame affect relationships. We just did a series on codependency, I don't want to go into great detail. But I want to recap for you how shame affects relationships. one way to understand codependency is it's two shame-based people trying to have a relationship together. That is the best definition of codependency. what happens. It's two people trying to hide who they really are. Two people of masks and walls who are trying to get their needs met, trying to get love and respect without revealing who they truly are. And that's why codependency has been called the dance of two shame-based people. Because they're dancing around, trying to get their needs met, trying to not get the other person too angry. And that is an offense. And that is an ongoing thing. what we have said is shame basically says I have no positive feelings about myself. Because I don't believe I have value or I'm lovable. if I am going to have any positive feelings about myself, they must come from others. I must put on an act,.",

    "output": "But one of the things the brain says is if I'm in a relationship, that proves somebody me. That proves that I must be lovable. therefore, to deal with my shame, the brain says the solution is be in a relationship all the time. Because that will give you proof that somebody loves you, you must be lovable. What then is the problem if you're not in a relationship and you're alone. Your brain goes, -oh, this is proof I'm not lovable. Therefore, I've got to run into a relationship. the brain says, -oh, this is proof I'm not lovable. that's why many shame-based people, when they feel their relationship is falling apart, they don't just break it off and sit alone for a while. They don't break it off until they have somebody else ready. Because they can't be alone because that would prove their deepest fear that they're not lovable. here's how it works out. you've got shame in the rectangle on the left, the blue rectangle. Then people respond. People respond to shame in different ways. some people respond by going to the gray oval at the bottom, the inferior position. I'm a nobody. I'm no good. And they just walk around with zero self-image. Others respond by trying to compensate. And they act they're better than everybody. And they go in the direction of being a narcissist. what you need to understand is those two people, they're not just trying to find each other, because what does the superior person want to fix their shame. Not just that I walk around feeling better. I need people to tell me I'm better than others. I need to rescue people. I need to find people who are messed up and help them out. Because what do they do when I help them out. They say, you are wonderful. You are fantastic. And that heals their shame, they think. And then how does it help the person who feels inferior to stay that way. , there's always a knight in shining armor that's going to come around to rescue them. And when they come and rescue them, they go, I'm going to give you all my time. You're worth it. Here, here's some gifts. Let me spend time with you and do stuff for you. And they go, I get much attention from being inferior.",

In the beginning, the superior person sacrifices all their needs for this inferior person. They make the inferior person the center of their universe. But that's about to change. Because what happens once they do that, the superiors rescuing the inferior, the inferiors feeling rescued and they're both feeling good, but they're not dealing with their shame in a meaningful way. they're both discontent at a deep level. And pretty soon, the superior person starts to get annoyed with the inferior person and say, why don't you carry your weight around here. I'm tired of doing everything for you. And all of a sudden he makes himself the center of the universe. And the other person has to give up all their and needs. And take charge. And take care of them. And then the inferior person, they go, why am I not getting the attention I used to get. And they start pouting and whining and creating crisis to try to draw the other person back. And you get more and more tension. And then the superior person, they start getting abusive. They start getting controlling. They start thinking, the way to get all the love that I need is to cut everybody else out of that person's life I'm the only one left. Then they'll give me all the love I need. they try to isolate them from all their friends and family. Trying to solve their shame. And then the relationship is drifting. It's falling apart. And both of them start to fear abandonment. they can go back to the honeymoon and say, let's try harder. And let's be on our best behavior. The inferior person can say, I need to keep them happy. I've been too demanding, too needy. I need to do more things for them. And they become a caretaker. And they give up more and more of their. But it's not solving shame. And the relationship keeps breaking down. What I want you to see is as long as shame is not dealt with, you can never have a healthy relationship. Shame has to be dealt with to some degree.",

    "output": ", welcome to another Friday night. Tonight we come to the last of our 85 characteristic talks. And what I'm going to cover tonight are the characteristics that have to deal with relationships. Now we've covered a bunch of different relationship stuff already. These are kind of the loose ends that need to get tied up. the first one is people coming out of complex trauma have grown up usually with double standards in relationships. they grew up where dad could be angry, but nobody else could. Mom could have snacks, but nobody else could. Dad would swear, but the kids couldn't swear. Kids had to give mom and dad respect, but mom and dad didn't have to give the kids respect. that double standard basically said to them that if you're an authority, you don't have to follow the rules. The rules don't apply to you. You can do whatever you want. You're kind of above the law. really two things come out of that. That to me, are really important to understand. that leads most people coming out of complex trauma to be very hypersensitive to injustice. Because living by double standards is basically life isn't fair. It's one set of rules for one person, different set of rules for another. There's not a fairness. there's a real hypersensitivity to any injustice in their adult life. But secondly, what many don't realize is that though they hate the double standard stuff, though they've been hurt by it over and over again, when they get to be adults and then in positions of authority, often in relationships, intimate relationships, where they're in a position of power, they often slide into this double standard without even realizing it. now that they're the boss, they get to make their own rules and, and they get to make rules for others. And often there's a difference. And. It's important to realize that what really is going on with this double standard that causing this injustice sensitivity is this isn't love. This isn't treating others the way you want to be treated. This isn't treating everybody equally. This is not love. And if we're going to get healthy, we have to live by this love, not double standard. The next one is most people coming out of complex trauma. And we're going to get healthy, we have to live by this love.",

    "input": "I've been dealing with complex trauma and I don't know how to heal from it. What should I know?",
    "output": "Then you start to consistently meet your needs, keep your word to yourself, keep your promise to others, and you become trustworthy to others and to yourself. And you're able to start trusting yourself again. Now there's something else that I need to point out here. A lot of people coming out of complex trauma have in their adult life made a lot of bad decisions. And they've let a lot of people down. And people just don't trust them anymore. Their kids don't trust them. Their family doesn't trust them. Their friends don't trust them. And the danger is to come into recovery and go, I am committed to change. I am going to be trustworthy. trust me now. And kind of demand that everybody trust you away. And then be offended that they're still not trusting you, that they're still looking at you with suspicion when you say you're going to go out with friends and they're,, , we know what that means. It means you're going to make a bunch of bad decisions. understand that for most people who've had their trust violated, it takes two to five years of a person being trustworthy before you're able to trust them totally again. You have to just accept that's part of the consequences of all my past untrustworthiness. I have to accept now that to rebuild trust, people are going to be able to trust me. People are going to be a bit suspicious of me for two to five years, and I can't get all offended by that. That's just the reality I have to accept. rebuilding trust is important, but it takes a lot of time, and it takes becoming trustworthy as a key piece to that. The next one is that most people coming out of complex trauma have authority issues. basically, everybody in their life who's been an authority has let them down, has hurt them, has not met their needs. authority to them has meant unjust treatment, betrayal, being lied to, broken promises, needs not met, unjustly punished. authority equals being hurt. what comes out of that for some people with complex trauma is oppositional defiance disorder. It's frequently diagnosed now in children. let me give you some of the reasons why oppositional defiance disorder comes out of complex trauma.",

    "output": "And in every situation, you look at what's my responsibility. What's their responsibility. I can change what I want. If they don't change what they should be changing, what is their responsibility, then I need to make decisions about my next move. The next characteristic. People from complex trauma tend to be attracted to emotionally unavailable people. And that's because in complex trauma, the significant people of your life weren't emotionally available. They were too busy. They were angry. They were depressed. They were involved in addiction. They were workaholics. They had their own trauma that made it difficult for them to be present to people in relationships. And a child basically does not then have secure attachment. Their template for relationships is emotionally unavailable people. And what does the child do in their mind. They go, it must be my fault that my parents aren't attaching to me. They're not available to me. the challenge then for the child is, I bet you I can figure out how to get them to attach. they continue to go, if I try this, maybe my parents will be available to me. If I try this, if I please them in this way, then they will want to be available to me. They place all the responsibility on themselves. But the key is that emotionally unavailable people become their norm. when they get to adult life, two things happen. When they meet an emotionally unavailable person, it feels normal. And they're actually attracted to it. But then part of them still is, I couldn't get mom and dad to attach to me. But now the challenge is all over again, what if I can get this person to attach to me. Let's try all of the different things. This now gives me energy that I want to try to get them to attach. Then there's another piece to this. And that is if they meet somebody and there is a very intense feeling of connection. Oh, we're close. There's a chemistry. It's not real truth. It's a connection. It's not real true intimacy. It's just intense oxytocin. Then they go, Oh, I think this person must be emotionally available. When usually the opposite is true. They've developed the ability to create intense feelings of connection because they're emotionally unavailable.",

    "output": "People coming out of complex trauma tend to have control over their own life. They tend to have control over their own needs. They tend to have control over their own problems. They tend to have control over their own issues. when you think of a child in complex trauma where their needs aren't being met, where there's chaos, where they're getting hurt, where it's inconsistent, you can see that control, being in control, is quite attractive. It seems to meet a whole bunch of complex trauma issues. if I'm in control, nobody's going to see my shame. Nobody's going to see how bad I think I am. If I'm in control, I don't have to worry about trusting anybody. If I'm in control, I'm not going to get hurt again. If I'm in control, I don't have to be afraid of change or the unknown because I'm in control of every detail. If I'm in control, that'll fix my anxiety. If I'm in control, nobody's ever going to abandon me. If I'm in control, I'll never feel helpless. I'll have a feeling of power. The thing I never had as a child. If I'm in control, it's going to help me be perfect. If I'm in control, that's going to make me feel better about all the internal turbulence that I live with and feel all the time. It's going to help make it feel less. being in control is very attractive to people coming out of complex trauma. But all the damage it does. It destroys relationships. It destroys parenting children. people, while I'm very organized, I don't think I'm a control freak. What are the characteristics of unhealthy control. let me very quickly give them two. You tend to micromanage others to make them fit your expectations of how things should be. And those expectations are often realistic. You don't believe in imperfection and you don't think anybody else should either. Everything needs to be perfect. Everything needs to be done perfectly, which is the way you want it to be done. You spend a lot of time trying to change those closest to you. You believe that if someone would change one or two things about themselves, then they'd be happier and you'd be happier. And you try to help them change their behavior. And it's not about really what's best for them.",

    "output": "And it's partly , but there's a whole bunch more things other than physical that deplete us. And that's where we're going to get to. But let me give you a bigger context here. Any time, we've got our sympathetic nervous system, which is our activity and our parasympathetic nervous system, which is our rest. They need to be in balance if we are going to keep our gas tanks full, to stay healthy, not burnout. if my sympathetic nervous system is going too much, and my parasympathetic nervous system is not allowed to bring in rest, and healing, and rejuvenation, I eventually am going to become depleted. And for people from complex trauma, this is why we become depleted easily, because we're used to being in our sympathetic nervous system all the time, because we are in survival mode. And it's easy to slide back into that. That's been the default setting for years. And big picture, what we're looking at with depletion is, learning when I'm in my sympathetic nervous system, when I'm back in survival mode type of stuff, and not in my parasympathetic in the balance. That is the big picture of what we're looking at. Now let me just say this. When we go into our sympathetic nervous system, it actually for many people feels good, because we get an adrenaline rush. We get more energy. We feel more alive. We don't feel depleted. And we go, this is a good thing. But what you don't realize is, if you don't get to the parasympathetic in the balance, being in your sympathetic too much feels good for now, but it's slowly taking its toll, and using up gas that you're not replenishing. And pretty soon you're going to burn out. You're going to be depleted. I'm going to give you some of the physical, physical things that they're finding. besides just overworking, over go, go, go all the time, not getting enough sleep. What they're finding is a person who loves multitasking. And they're always wanting to multitask. That takes a lot of energy. And it can deplete us more quickly than a person who just does one thing at a time. Another thing they're finding is people that live, in cluttered, messy spaces, without realizing that's actually depleting them. That's taking energy out of them just to live in that space.",

    "output": "Another one is being cooped up inside, all alone. you don't go out, you don't connect, you don't interact with people, you don't do anything social, you just stay cooped up. That takes a lot of energy. Other ones, not drinking enough water, dehydration. Another one, people who live with chronic physical pain. just living with pain takes a ton of energy. those people get depleted. People that are fighting a sickness, an infection, a virus, get depleted because it takes a lot of energy to fight those things. People recovering from surgery, where their body's doing a ton of healing physically, are very tired. And then, people who go through a major move, or a major change in life, job-wise, moving to a different city, a new relationship, a child moving away from home, a new baby, a ton of energy required. And they can become very depleted because of that. those are all physical things. But what I want you to realize is that's only a small part of what depletes us. One of the things that depletes us, probably more than anything, is emotions. let's talk about that. Because for people from complex trauma who've suppressed emotions, disconnected from emotions, they don't realize how much energy emotions take. And what we find for many people who take our LIFT program, or REACT program, is after a couple weeks, they're just exhausted. And they go, why. I haven't been doing anything. And they're still thinking in terms of physical activity is the only thing that makes you tired. And I go, no, you're doing human's work when it comes to emotions now. And you're exhausted because of all the emotional work that you're doing. And that's a new concept for them. , things that deplete us in the emotional world, and it's fascinating to me what they're finding out, is when you have stuff emotions all the time, you've got anger coming up, you stuff it down. You've got fear coming up, you stuff it down. That's intense emotional stuff that you're stuffing. If you go through loss, and you stuff it down. It's holding a beach ball under water. It takes a lot of energy to stuff down an intense emotion. And you get to play. And because of that.",

    "output": "You just fly off the handle, and you go on a rampage in your triggered, dysregulated state. You're going to be exhausted afterwards. Giving in to that trigger and going to your limbic brain and just letting it fuel a whole bunch of behaviors takes a lot of energy. Another one they're finding is if you are constantly just negative, in a negative place in your head, criticizing everything, being negative about everything, complaining about everything in your life, it takes a lot of energy. It depletes you. And part of that is because you're not giving your brain the good chemicals it needs, the serotonin, the dopamine, the oxytocin that it needs to feel good, to get energy, you're depriving it of that by just focusing on negative all the time, and it depletes you. If you become involved in a cause, a very important cause, let's say climate-related, racial-related, inequality of the sexes-related, injustice at work, whatever, if you become in a cause that is passionate to you, it's going to stir up a lot of intense emotions, and that can be very draining, especially if you then spend time on social media, on the internet, researching the cause, listening to what other people say about the cause. It keeps stirring up intense emotions, and that can be very draining. If you are a perfectionist, or if you are a bit of a control freak, you just always want to control everything in everybody's life, that takes a lot of emotional energy. It takes a lot of energy, and there's going to be a depletion that can come out of that. Now let me take this a little bit further into deeper complex trauma. Most people that come out of complex trauma have what I call a default setting. It's where their brain naturally just has become used to, and is their normal. that could be fear, that could be shame, that could be feeling guilt. All of those just, that's the way they've lived. All their childhood is feeling those emotions, and now that's just their normal, their default setting. if you have a default setting, of shame, I'm not good enough, my life sucks, I'm not valuable, I'm not lovable, that's going to result in a default setting where you're always seeking validation maybe, or approval from others. That's draining.",

If they listen to their gut, it just causes more internal tension that nobody's going to listen to. Nobody's going to respect. just ignore their gut and go with their uncle. And then they get molested. But they've trained themselves to shut down their gut. Their intuition, their gut. And now what happens is they go into adult life. They go into dangerous situations with dangerous people. Their gut, their intuition is trying to tell them this is dangerous. And they've ignored their gut for long, they don't listen to it. And they end up recreating the very thing they hated in childhood. Another part to this is when you've been in unhealthy situation, you're not going to listen to it. You're not going to listen to it. You're not going to listen to it. you've been with a narcissist as your dad was a narcissist. Your mom was a narcissist. You couldn't get away from that. They were toxic. They were cruel. But you learned to live with it. You learned how to manage it. You learned how to survive with a narcissist. You lived with that every day. That became your normal. That became your skill set. That feels. Now without realizing it. Though you hate narcissists, when you get into adult life, you are actually attracted to narcissists because it feels normal. Something in your brain goes, I know what to do with this. I'm attracted to it. And you end up back where you were trying to avoid the thing you hated. There's another piece here that's very subtle. And it's when you begin to realize that complex trauma is having to do with the fact that you're not going to listen to it. You're not going to listen to it. You're not going to listen to it. You're not going to listen to it. You're not going to listen to it. You're not going to listen to it. You're not going to listen to it. You're not going to listen to it.

You hate it because you got hurt, but their influence over you, how they trained you, how they indoctrinated you, your brain just learned all kinds of tools. now in adult life, you just automatically do those tools. You automatically adopt those viewpoints. You automatically adopt those perspectives, those biases, and you end up in the very same place. There's another thing that causes this. many people coming out of complex trauma fall into wrongly diagnosing why they're experiencing pain in adult life. And when they wrongly diagnose, then they come up with the wrong solution. if they're disrespected, they conclude the reason is because they must be different. Therefore, I need to wear masks. they conclude I'm the bad. That's why I'm disrespected. They don't see it as the other person's problem. they actually see shame. They believe shame lies. They see the solution then as wearing masks. they got the wrong diagnosis that I'm the problem. They got the wrong solution, wear masks. Never say no. Be a people pleaser. All of that.

What you don't realize is by being a people pleaser, by wearing masks, people see through that and they lose respect more and more for you. you're trying to avoid disrespect. You wrongly diagnosed, came up with the wrong solution, seemed to work, but it actually led to greater disrespect in the long run. there's a pendulum swing. You get it also with people who grew up with a dad who was a military general and he just autocratic rules, harsh discipline, no nurture, no love. Everything was conditional. You go, I'll never be my dad. I am going to go to the opposite and I'm going to be super kind to my kids. Let my kids make their decisions all the time.",

    "output": "For the first time in your life, you're taking care of your own needs and saying, my needs matter just as much as yours. But to them, that's you being a narcissist and you start believing that you start second guessing yourself and you go, maybe I am a narcissist. , it kind of feels it because I'm standing up for myself and you get all confused and you start second guessing yourself. And you hit this new level of, am I. Am I wrong. Am I wrong. Am I getting healthy. Maybe I am what my family says I am. And that confusion and doubt just feels terrible inside. And what happens for pretty everybody in recovery is they come to this place where recovery starts to feel negative. It starts to feel a lot of work. It starts to have more negative results than felt positive results. And they begin to go. I wonder if I made the decision and coming into recovery. I wonder if recovery is actually worth it. Maybe I should go back to the way things used to be. And they sabotage their recovery. growth and change creates a desire to go back to the old way. It creates fears and stress that they weren't anticipating. And what I want you to realize is those first three to six months of recovery. Start with positive. Then they hit a real negative stretch. Growth becomes very fragile. It's really easy to regress to old behaviors. But if it pushes you to realize this is temporary, this is forcing me to face fears and issues I never realized I had, it will lead to even greater growth. fear is such a big issue with complex trauma. We spend a whole day thinking about it. We spend a whole day thinking about it. We spend a whole week in our LIFT program helping people begin working through these painful emotions and their fears. I hope this just helps put words to some of what's been happening in your subconscious world. I hope it helps you realize I need to get some help. And these fears you can deal with, these fears you can get much help with. I hope you'll do that. I can do anything and this will help, next time don't forget the whoeverde you are with us.",

    "output": "you tend to reenact old dynamics. you are attracted to a narcissist, you put up with red flags and stuff in the relationship that you shouldn't, and pretty soon you're back into a narcissistic relationship. , welcome to another little chat with Tim. I want to do a little mini series, short chats on some more narcissism stuff. I've done talks on narcissism in the past that I've really tried to explore it in depth, but I just wanted to add a few things that I've picked up over the years that I thought I'd put into short videos. Today I'd to talk about what's the results of being in a relationship with a narcissist for a period of time. How does it affect the person. And this could be, being in an intimate relationship where there's a partner, a husband, a wife, whatever, or it could be a parent or grandparent that you were in a relationship with for years, or it could be a boss or a religious leader that claims to represent , and then you do all you can to please them and have a relationship with them as your or leader. How does that affect you. And I would say there's a real good chance that you have complex trauma or complex PTSD as a result of that. Because what happens when you're in a relationship with a narcissist is that you're always on guard, you're always feeling a certain element of lack of safety or danger or something might happen. And over time, that begins to take its toll and you get complex trauma. Now, some of you might get, a little bit resistant to that and go, I don't think that's going to, that's what happened to me. And what I'd to do today is just to give you a very basic test that you can apply to yourself, hopefully with an open mind, just to see if these characteristics apply to you. And then at the end, we'll talk a little bit more about it. what are the indicators that a person has complex PTSD. And if you come out of a relationship with a narcissist, you're going to be a narcissist and you have these characteristics, then you go, where did these characteristics come from. the first is just basically you've been exposed to actual or threatened violence.",

To heal you. To value you. And then you find you have difficulty trusting. The narcissist has caused you to distrust everybody. And now when you meet new people, you just assume they're going to manipulate you. Betray you. Abandon you. Use you. trust has been terribly damaged. And then you find you just have this deep, deep anger inside. For all that you've done. All that you've been through. The mistreatment for not being seen. For your needs not being met.

    "output": "welcome again. Tonight we're coming, believe it or not, to our last talk on shame. And it is all going to be positive this week. It's going to be healing shame. And last week we started healing shame and it was actually kind of painful, but it was part of the healing process is the self-awareness. let me begin by saying this. One of the questions that I get asked all the time when people start realizing what shame is, is they ask me, am I ever going to get over this. Will I ever heal from shame. And what they're hoping I'll do is say, yes, on this date in 2020, you will be over your shame. And what they are really realizing though, as they get to understand shame is how deeply rooted it is, how much it affects every part of their life. And they begin to realize there's going to be a lot of shame. And they begin to realize there's going to be a lot of shame. And they begin to realize there's going to be a lot of shame. And they will start to realize where they live. And the other thing that I'm hearing asking is how solid is this relationship that you and I are going to see, those processes, those events, those conversations. And those experiences that you and I are going to see, those conversations has a lot of meaning. There's this sort of emotionalization or emotion about the world overwhelmed with the kind of pain that we're experiencing, STUDYahon. Food is proud of. I'm going to have wonderful ë conducting a And then if you're healing, the triggers become less intense, and then you're able to process through them more quickly. currently it could be that once your shame is triggered, you're wiped out for two days in your head and in all your dark places. As you heal and grow, you can begin to work through stuff in five minutes, an hour, and you become kind of amazed at how quickly you get through stuff. it is possible to make lots of healing steps forward, but probably the journey will go on at some level, to some degree, for the rest of your life.",

    "output": "But I don't want that to be discouraging, because as you start to feel the healing, you'll be surprised at how much better you feel overall. you will begin to experience benefits very quickly as you start to feel the healing. And then you'll finally begin to deal with it. Part of what determines how long the journey is going to be is how much shame is there in your life, number one, how many triggers do you have, and how safe are your relationships. You can't heal from shame in an unsafe environment. you need to have safe people, safe environment, or else if you're with unsafe people, you just keep getting shame messages. the better you are, the better you are. The better you're able to have safe people, the faster you can heal from shame. Next thing I want you to understand is this. The initial healing from shame is very real, but it's very fragile. Some of you might have this experience. You've been working on yourself. Let's say you've been coming to Finding Freedom, React, and you're starting to feel better about yourself. You're actually starting to respect yourself and accept yourself, and you're feeling really good, and then you go and spend the day with mom. And you come there going, I didn't think, I guess I never learned anything. I'm back to feeling crappy about myself. And the point is this. You grew, but that growth is fragile. It's new leaves on a brand new baby plant. And the slightest thing can destroy them. part of what you have to do in recovery is really set boundaries to protect that growth it can solidify and become stronger and stronger. that is just upfront that you need to be aware of. , I want to give you the four steps of healing that we've talked about far. And you may not have realized I was throwing some of these in as we went along in the first five talks. But over every talk, there's been an element of self-awareness. And what we focus on is self-awareness. Self-awareness is the ability to be more self-aware. Self-awareness is the ability to be more self-aware.",

    "input": "Can you explain how trust affects someone and what the path to recovery looks like?",
    "output": "Now let me add one piece to this. The problem with complex trauma is that failure becomes something that the person sees as only bad. Failure never led to anything good just to pain and punishment. But what was the actual design of failure. It was positive. It was to be an example that you could learn from. failure was to be turned into a positive. That was the design. But if you come from a background where failure was always bad and always was painful, you're afraid of failure. And what you're doing in recovery is changing your thinking there and saying, I'm going to fall on my face. That's not the end of the world. That doesn't mean I'm a total failure. That means I now have something I can learn from. I don't repeat that again. And it turns into a positive learning experience. Number eight. And you're going to see these all begin to overlap a little bit. But you have to forgive yourself for what you've done in the past. And when you fail today, you have to deal with it, change, and forgive yourself. what happens for a child that comes out of complex trauma. When you do something wrong, there's no way to fix it. You get punished for it. You get thrown in your face. And you learn that if you fail, beat yourself up. Beat yourself up. Get down on yourself. That's how you were parented. That's how you now parent yourself. That feeds shame. Now let me take it a step further. You have done a lot of things that you're greatly ashamed of. Stuff that has hurt your children and created trauma in them. You made a lot of mistakes in your teens and twenties that you wish you could redo and take back. But you have to, with complex trauma, go back to the child who's living in danger that they cannot resolve. They cannot fix. They cannot get out of to a healthy place. What was their only solution. Fight, flight, death. Fight, flight, freeze. Survival. The very tools needed to fight, flight, freeze, lying, not trusting, wearing masks, they messed up your life. But don't punish the child for trying to survive. Don't punish the child for using the only tools they had available to survive. You can't go back and change that child's decisions.",

    "output": "don't punish them and don't punish yourself for those survival decisions. You can change them now and you need to do that. But stop beating yourself up for the things you did to survive. That is the point I want you to get. Now let me take it further. Many people think of forgiveness as a feeling. A limbic brain think, I'll feel or I'll forgive myself when I feel that I've paid for my crimes. guess when that's going to happen. Never. Because you'll keep beating yourself up which will lead to more failure, which will lead to more beating yourself up, etc. It becomes a vicious cycle that is spiraling downhill. what you have to do is this. I choose to forgive myself. And what that means is if I fail or if I have a memory of a failure, instead of going to the negative take-home, I'm going to the negative tapes in my head where I beat myself up, I say, no, not going there. I forgive myself. I choose to change. I choose to learn from that and become better because of it. But I'm not going to go beating myself up. That's what forgiveness is in forgiving yourself. Absolutely essential if you're going to deal with your shame. Now the next two are tied together. Remember we said that shame is a child looking into the mirror. The child is looking into the mirrors of the people in their life. And the people of significance in their life reflect back to them by what they say and do the value of the child, who the child is. if the child's neglected and abused and abandoned, what's being reflected back to them is you're a zero. You're not worth love. You don't have value. those are the mirrors of their life, but they're all distorted mirrors. What you have to do now if you want to heal your shame is you've got to surround yourself with more accurate mirrors. People that will reflect back to you a more accurate picture of your value, of who you are, that you are lovable, that you are significant. But then with that, you need boundaries with unhealthy mirrors. you might have to say, I can't hang around with my mom for now. Because the growth and the healing is too fragile.",

    "input": "What should someone know about complex trauma and how it affects their relationships and healing?",
    "output": "a couple things that I want you to think about. One of the things that you're grieving with shame is you didn't get a healthy childhood that you should have got. you're grieving something you never had but you should have had. you've lost something that you've never had but you've lost something you should have had. And part of what happens as people get to know about complex trauma and their shame is they begin to realize how much their childhood affected them and they start to go, I wish I had a different childhood. I wish I didn't go through that. And then they start grieving what they didn't have. Secondly, you grieve the many losses that you did have. The loss of connection. The loss of certain friendships. The loss of certain things because of choices by family or yourself. there's a grieving part that is part of the healing process. Next one. You have to have a clean conscience. what we talked about in the first talk was this. Guilt is about what I do. Shame is about who I am. The problem with complex trauma is when you do something bad, they say you are bad. they blend guilt and shame. And what happens now when you fail, you do something morally wrong, you tell a lie, you cheat, whatever, it feeds your shame. And you walk around saying, not only did I fail, I'm a failure. And it feeds your shame. if you do something morally wrong and your conscience bothers you, clean it up away. Because if you don't, it's going to keep bugging you and it gradually is going to pull you into deeper shame. that becomes an important piece. Next one. Service. And what I want to say about this is for many people, service is important in finding out what I'm good at. What I can offer people and it helps me heal to realize I have something to offer. But for some people it's very dangerous. Because if you got your validation as a child from helping everybody and you were the perfect little servant around the house, and that's where your validation came from, to step back into a service world, could really mess you up. Because it could pull you back into looking for validation which comes a drug.",

    "input": "I've been dealing with validation and I don't know how to heal from it. What should I know?",
    "output": "if that was part of your validation growing up, be very careful as you get into service. Don't go there unless people in your life think you're ready for it. Because it's very easy to get there and then once you're there, you start to get into service. You stop working on yourself, you get wrapped up in all that you're doing, and then if you're struggling, you're afraid to say anything because now everybody's looking up to you and it becomes a disaster. Next one, many people find there's a value in healing shame in the spiritual thing, in a higher power, in a new belief system that is a better definition of happiness, of value, of what makes life work. All of that can be important. If you do have or a higher power, that becomes for you a mirror that you believe is the most accurate mirror in the world. And that tells you the truth about yourself better than anybody else. that one is important. Next one, humility versus humiliation. Now here's what I want you to understand. A lot of people, cultures, religious people, have defined humility as shame. Now I want you to understand that. If you go to many places and ask them to define humility, guess what they'll say. You're worse than everybody. You never walk around and say, I accomplished something. You see yourself as less than. And if you ever feel good about yourself, shame on you, you're proud. You should be walking around saying, I'm a nobody, I'm no good. And that's how they define humility. You realize that is the wrong definition. And if you're going to heal from shame, you need the definition of humility. And the definition of humility is this. You see yourself accurately. And what does it mean to see yourself accurately. I'm not better than or worse than anybody. Humans, we're a level playing field. We all have equal value. Secondly, humility says, I want to learn. I want to keep growing. I don't want to get locked into this place where I can't risk trying anything for fear of failure, or I can never be wrong because I might be humiliated. the fear of people from complex trauma is if I humble myself, I will get humiliated. And humiliated was terrible. Humility is totally different. It is seeing myself accurately.",

Now we spend a lot of time at React. Let me just say a few things. Inner child for a lot of people, they go, oh, that's hokey. That's just weird. What are you going to ask me to do. here's how I talk about it. I think everybody that I deal with from complex trauma, if I say, do you still sense there's a little child in you somewhere. They all agree. And then I go, let's just focus on that little child inside of you, which is a younger you. What emotions is in you that child is feeling. And they'll go, wow, they're hurt. They're sad. They're angry. They're full of fear. They got tons of shame. And they hate themselves. I say, that child, that inner you, that little you, has nothing but negative emotions. How does that child look physically. They got their head down. They're curled up in a fetal position. They can't look at people in the eye. They can define and describe that child. , how does that child feel about you, the adult. Ooh, he doesn't trust me. Why. Because I abandoned that child. I hated that part of me. I didn't want anything to do with that part of me. I was impatient with that part of me. I was embarrassed by that part of me. , that child feels abandoned by you and doesn't trust you. But that child is you. It's a part of you. healing from shame is taking that part of you that you've rejected and been embarrassed by and accepting it and nurturing it that it feels loved and it can heal and become part of the adult you. that's what this is about. then I say, let's just say one of your biological children spilled their milk or fell off their bike and tore a hole in their brand new pair of pants. What would you do to that child as they're crying and angry at themselves. You would hug them. You'd say, it's. It's just things, et cetera. You would nurture them and comfort them.

You start to journal a bit, and then what you realize, though, is I don't what I'm having to live with. There's a lot of painful emotions. There's a lot of negative thinking. And it's not comfortable, and I don't know how to resolve it. And your brain subconsciously says, let's shut her down. Let's disconnect from ourselves that we don't feel anything. And what you need to understand about this, if you've been going through it, is this happens subconsciously. And that's what makes it dangerous for people in recovery, is that this disconnection can be happening without them even realizing it. And sometimes they don't begin to realize it until it's too late. And that's why I want to talk about it, because to me, not being aware of what's going on inside of you is one of the most dangerous things for a person with trauma and recovery. why do people from complex trauma disconnect from themselves easily. And I think there's two reasons for it. First of all, it happened in early childhood. If you weren't able to. You weren't able to connect with your parents. You tried to form a bond. You tried to attach. You tried to talk about stuff and you got laughed at. You got put down. And what happened in all of that as you were neglected or abused is that you began to say, if my parents don't want to connect with me, I must be a really bad person. I don't want to connect with myself. Because to connect with myself would be torture. It would be connecting with myself. It would be connecting with myself. It would be connecting with myself. It would be connecting to somebody that I'm starting to hate. And because of that, the brain at an early age for most people begins to say, connecting with self is a terrible thing because I need to get away from self because nobody else self and now I don't even myself.",

    "output": "The second thing that can happen in complex trauma is the challenge or the dilemma that the brain has with all of these negative emotions that it can't handle. It can't handle. It can't handle. It can't handle. It can't handle. It can't resolve. you have anger. You have fear. You have depression. You have anxiety. And the brain's trying to find solutions and it can't. And at some point, the brain says, I can't continue to live with all of these unresolved negative emotions since that's what I'm living with 99 of the time. The only way I know how to resolve these painful emotions is to shut down, to disconnect from my emotions. To stop feeling. To stop feeling. To stop feeling. To harden myself I don't feel anymore. And that's what makes drugs and alcohol attractive for people with complex trauma. Because once they find drugs and alcohol, they go, I have just found the perfect solution for my unresolved negative emotions. Now I can numb them and escape them and go to pleasure places. That I wouldn't be able to get to in the natural world. And drugs and alcohol become the main way of numbing and avoiding, of escaping all of these negative unresolved emotions. what is the result of disconnecting. Because a lot of people will say to me, what's the big deal. I don't care. I disconnect. I it that way. I don't think it causes me any problems. let me give you some of the problems that come out of disconnecting. The first, and this is something that I've learned in studying for this, is there's a new type of mental health category, at least to me that it's new, and it's called depersonalization disorder. And some psychologists consider it to be the third most common disorder in our world today outside of depression. And what we're going to do is we're going to look at the three main types of depression and anxiety. they would say depression and anxiety are the most common and the most devastating. And then DPD, depersonalization disorder. A guy named Jeffrey Bugle, I believe is how you say it. He's a medical journalist and he's written a book called Stranger to Myself. And it's about depersonalization disorder. And what he basically says is that people who have trauma and they become a stranger to themselves.",

    "output": "if your life all of a sudden goes from, I just want to go to the bathroom, to just a quiet routine, to all kinds of commotion, all kinds of activity, drama happening because your kids are around, because you got to take care of all these extra needs for them. All of a sudden you can find yourself disconnecting without even realizing it. And extra drama and commotion triggers it. Another one is as stress increases, what people find is that it reaches a point of tolerance and then your brain disconnects if the stress goes beyond that point. And that's your brain saying, I can't deal with this, it's time to disconnect. stress can cause disconnection. Depression is another thing that can cause disconnection and anxiety. what the brain is saying, I'm living with depression and anxiety, I can't resolve this, I don't it, it's painful stuff, and I just want to disconnect. And I just need to disconnect. That's the only way I know how to live with this. Now something that I want you to realize is that those first ones that I just mentioned to you all involve cortisol in the brain. Anxiety, that's a fear. Depression, extra busyness and stress. when cortisol is in the brain, you disconnect from a lot of things because you go into survival mode. And survival mode, requires disconnection from emotions because you don't have time to deal with that. You just have to survive. be aware of that. Other things are other unresolved emotions. if you can't resolve depression and can't resolve anxiety, the brain starts to disconnect. The same is true if it can't resolve boredom or loneliness. All of those things, if it tries to resolve it and it can't, the brain will eventually say, it's time to disconnect. That's the only solution to these emotions that I can't resolve. Change can trigger disconnection because now you're in a new circumstance. You're on heightened alert. Your limbic brain is triggered and you start to disconnect. Also being overtired. You just have no energy. You just are trying to get through an issue. You're trying to get through another day. And for a lot of people, they disconnect because it takes energy to be self-aware and that is a dangerous time. Another thing that people can do is procrastinate.",

If you're disconnecting, most people will feel a certain amount of discontent. They feel antsy. They feel unsettled. They can't just relax. With that, for many people, they just all of a sudden notice they're more irritable, more edgy, crabby, even a bit depressed. All of those things could be signs of disconnection. Or you go to the other extreme and you're just totally out of touch with how you feel. You don't even know what your mood is. You're just out of touch. Others just check out. They're in a group. They get bored. They're checking out. And that can lead people to start go back to addictive behaviors. The final one that some people will have as early warning sign is they start to realize that they're disconnecting from others. And that can be a sign that you're also disconnecting. from yourself. those are very important things. And I hope you realize that for most people in recovery, if they start disconnecting, many will relapse within a day or two. If they've been in recovery for a while, they might last for a week or two. But the longer they stay disconnected, the greater the danger is for them. And this is such an important thing to stay connected. how do we do that. What are tools that will enable me to connect and stay connected. we're going to just focus on connecting with yourself because that's where all of this starts. And there's an element where you have to deal with your shame because shame says I don't myself. The reason I was abandoned or neglected or abused by others because I think I'm unlovable. And I've been running from myself all my life. And you have to begin to say, I got to go. I got to work on that and heal my shame because I know I have value and I know that I am worth something. you begin dealing with shame. the goal is to develop a relationship with yourself. That's what connecting is all about. Becoming your own friend. what I'd encourage is that you begin to set aside some time every day where you can be with yourself quietly. And that can go for five minutes, 15 minutes, an hour.",

Some who are aware of their anger issues are afraid of their own anger, and they are afraid that if their anger gets triggered, where it might take them. And that for them makes this a very important topic. And what I have seen is when it comes to guilt in people dealing with trauma and who are in recovery from addiction, their greatest amount of guilt usually comes from stuff they did while they were in the problem, using, what they did to their kids, etc. But the second greatest cause of guilt is usually what they've done when they've been angry. Things they've said, things they've done to their kids, to their partner, to friends, to family, that they can't take back. And the damage has been done, and they see the damage, and it causes a ton of guilt. Most people aren't controlling it very and are doing things that they deeply regret the next day. But it's too late to take it back. What makes it difficult in complex trauma is that when you get triggered to get angry, or something triggers your anger, you have a nanosecond in which to make a decision about, how to respond. Because your anger in a nanosecond goes from zero to a hundred, and you make decisions that take you in old pathways that are very hard to stop once that anger gets triggered. That leads to the trigger stuff. If you're from complex trauma, you probably have hundreds of things that trigger your anger. If you get disrespected, and you can get disrespected hundreds of different ways, each one of those will trigger your anger. If you get disrespected, and you can get disrespected hundreds of different ways, each one of those will trigger your anger. If there's injustice, it will trigger your anger. If somebody lies to you or cheats on you, that triggers your anger. You got trigger after trigger after trigger. you have two good days and you think, I got my anger under control, and then in one day you get five triggers, and you go through to the moon and back with your anger.",

But when you come out of complex trauma, a good part of your anger is directed at yourself. And that can come from guilt. That can come from shame. That can come from all kinds of different things. But there's a ton of anger that has never been resolved towards yourself. let me give you the questions that I would ask. Scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being absolute none, 0, next to nothing. 10 being crazy, high, through the roof. How much anger was in your family of origin. Now I don't want you to think just in terms of explosive anger with dad yelling and throwing things and hitting things. What I want you to think about is how much anger and tension, how much anger and tension, and awkwardness did you sense. Because some of you just lived in constant fear and walked on eggshells for fear that somebody was going to get anger. There was much tension in the air. that would be a 9 or a 10 in your growing up world. it could be violent anger. It could be just supercharged tension environment. Second question. As you look at yourself, as you look at your own life, in the past 10 years, on average, where would you put your anger. Zero anger or living with the needle in the red, constantly ready to blow a fuse and explode at any moment. that's an evaluation for you. And then in the last two months of your life, where would you rank your anger. Would it be the same as your average over the last 10 years. Or is there a lot less anger in your life these days. Give yourself kind of a comparison point as you look at your own anger. And then what has been your latest anger experience. Some of you, it was coming here tonight. Some of you, as soon as you saw somebody here tonight. Whatever. Some are agreeing with me on that. What I want you to understand is what triggered it and how intense did it get. that's your answer. that's your latest thing to kind of tap into. that's a bit of an overview introduction around anger.",

And a volcano has all of the lava that is down below the surface. That is seething, bubbling away all the time. And then every once in a while there's an eruption. anger one is the lava. Anger two is the eruption. Most anger management courses focus on the eruption type of anger and how to control that. The difference with complex trauma is that the lava anger is the main issue. And unless you deal with the lava anger, you're going to keep erupting no matter how many courses you take. understanding the lava anger is critical.",

    "output": "over 90 of people with complex trauma end up with anxiety and depression, and the two usually go together. if you were to reduce a definition of anxiety or understanding anxiety, think of it through the eyes of a child. You feel anxiety when you don't have resources to handle a situation. Anxiety or fear then is actually a gift, because what happens when you don't have resources as a child to handle a scary situation. You feel fear, but what does fear make you do. It makes you run to somebody who's bigger than you, who's stronger than you, who can protect you, and it makes you want to connect with them, and if you connect with them, and they then come in to protect you and help you with that circumstance that's too big for you, then you relax, because the problem is now resolved. You've connected to somebody stronger than you that loves you. fear is a gift that drives you to the person for protection, and that the situation is resolved. But what happens in complex trauma. The child's in a situation that they can't handle. They're afraid they're going to get hurt. They run to mom and dad to connect, and no connection is available. Dad's too busy. Mom's got her own mental health issues. They're angry. They lash out, all kinds of different things, but they're not able to connect with the people they should be able to connect to. They're afraid. They're afraid of the people they should be able to connect to. Therefore, they're not able to resolve the fear. The problem doesn't go away, and the fear now is constantly there, because they feel all alone to face a scary, big, bad world. They feel abandoned, and fear becomes a constant, and it now begins to control because basically if I can't connect with anybody, I better figure out how to do keeping myself safe, and fear just constantly becomes this controlling emotion for them.",

The next one that's important to understand is people with complex trauma want to hope, but they're afraid to hope. the graph shows what happens for most people coming out of complex trauma. They get their hopes up that, dad just rejected me. Dad didn't have time for me. I couldn't connect with dad and I tried. I didn't get my needs met. hopefully if I just change, it must be my fault. I'll do more chores. I'll be kinder to dad. I'll do extra things for dad. And then hopefully then dad will accept me and want to connect with me and meet my needs. that's where they go in their head. they start doing extra stuff and it seems to be going. Dad seems to be. He's not rejecting them. He's kind of meeting their needs. they start to get. Their hopes up. And then all some something triggers dad and it's back to disconnect, not meeting needs, rejection, hurt.

But secondly, they got their hopes up in their hopes for dashed. That's really painful. That's a second. Painful. Pain that got added onto it. But the child has this amazing capacity to keep hoping. And they keep thinking, it must be my fault. I got to figure out what I'm not doing. And I got to change that. maybe if I wear this mask, maybe if I become a hero, maybe if I become a comedian, maybe if I get involved in sports because dad sports and they just keep trying one option after another.

The issue in complex trauma is a child is in circumstances that aren't fair, that are painful, that aren't safe. And they're trying to fix them, but mom and dad aren't allowing that to happen. Or the teacher at school isn't allowing that to happen. there's no way for them to solve their own problems. It doesn't matter what they try. It doesn't improve their situation. They remain in ongoing pain. And the brain is looking for ways to escape that problem-filled life. Since nothing healthy is working.

For people in extreme abuse. The brain has tried everything to relieve the abuse. To make the situation better. And nothing has worked. And the abuse is severe. That the brain just takes over in trying to protect the child. And it will actually dissociate. From the events that are around that child. that the child can have an out of body experience. They can be they're on the ceiling looking down. And that's happening to somebody else. Or they can escape to some place that is safe. But it's a subconscious thing. They're not consciously doing it. The brain just does it as a last ditch effort to protect this child. And that begins your dissociative disorders. But let's go back to a person that escapes of their own choice to a fantasy world. What you need to understand is that their current situation is creating a lot of negative emotions and pain in their limbic brain. And what the brain is wanting to do is find something that will overpower the negative limbic brain emotions with positive emotions. Instantly. And escaping to a fantasy world is a way to take all those positive emotions and make them feel they're happening. And overpower the negative emotions of their current situation.

I live with the pain of constant shame. I don't myself. And in some cases I hate myself. And now people escape to fantasy they don't have to live in their own skin. they can imagine a different them.

    "output": "you give them gifts. You're super nice to them. You do things for them. All of that to get them to trust you, and then you abuse them. Huge betrayal. And then sadly, many of you have gone through infidelity, where you've been in a relationship with a partner who said they've loved you, and then they've cheated on you. And that can be physical, cheating on you, or they can have an emotional affair. They can get involved. They can get involved in a relationship with somebody where they're sharing very, very deeply, vulnerably, not telling you much of what's going on in their life, but telling somebody else. That's a deep form of betrayal. Or you find out that your partner is deeply involved in sexual addiction and looking at pornography all the time, and that feels a great form of betrayal to you as. Then you're going to get the situation where you're going to get a lot of people who are going to say, let's say somebody has cheated on you. And they come back and they are sorry. I'll never do it again. Give me another chance. And in that time of crisis, they take a program. They ask for help. They go for counseling. And you decide, I'll give them another chance. And you do. And it looks for a while, they have changed. But then they do it all over again. And it's a second type of betrayal. A second time of betrayal. And it hurts just as bad. Another one many of you went through is if the family kind of saw you as the scapegoat. if something went wrong, you got blamed for it. Even though you had done nothing wrong, even though it was somebody else's fault, it was made to be your fault. That's a form of betrayal. When you're blamed for everybody else's mistakes. The final one I want to give as an example is anytime that you're in a relationship with a narcissist, you will end up betrayed. Because the narcissist doesn't know how to love people just to use people. The narcissist is ultimately what matters. Even though they say they love you and that you matter, ultimately what matters to them is they themselves getting what they want. And any relationship with a narcissist, you will eventually at some point experience betrayal.",

You are in shock. You just can't believe it. Then you can go to a deep grief. You are just overwhelmed with a deep sadness, often even a hopelessness. Life just is negative, painful, dark. But then you can go to that deep anger, rage. Then you can go to just fear. What now. What's going to happen in my life. And everything is scary. And then you can get paranoid and almost have this kind of terror that you live with. Some go to guilt. I must have done something wrong. It's probably my fault. And that's that self-blame stuff that we just talked about. Others go, it triggers their shame at a deep level. See that proves I'm not worth anything. I'm not lovable. I'm not valuable. If I was they wouldn't have done this. And it just reinforces the deep shame messages. Others just go numb. It's too much to take in. They just go to not feeling anything. And they detach from, others. They just don't want to be with anybody. They just want to be alone. And they're just numb. Then it can lead to just this haunting loneliness. That the person I thought loved me has betrayed me. I am all alone and it is overwhelming. And then often a deep feeling of being violated. Then another thing that begins often to happen emotionally with people is, after they've been betrayed, they have a great deal of difficulty regulating their emotions. all of a sudden they have massive mood swings several times a day, or they get triggered and they just go from zero to hundred in a nanosecond and they can't stop it. emotional regulation becomes a problem. Others then begin to struggle with depression, anxiety, worry, panic attacks. Some go to this apathy. They lose all motivation for life. The things that they used to enjoy, they don't do anything for them anymore. They're just blah. Some go to suicidal ideation.",

You can never say no to me. You can never say you need some personal space. And they resist boundaries. And boundaries to them proves you aren't loyal. You don't love me. You don't care. what you can see is betrayal trauma sets a person up to have great difficulty in future relationships. And that is what most people realize is their biggest challenge as they come out of betrayal trauma. There's one other thing that happens. There's one other thing that happens with betrayal trauma that includes sexual abuse. And that is there's sexual symptoms in the future. And there can be an aversion to sex. Sex just makes me feel dirty. Sex makes me feel awful. It's disgusting. And it just triggers much painful stuff. I don't want sex. Or if I do have sex, it's just I do it out of obligation. It's not something I enjoy. But I do. I do it out of obligation. Some become just uncomfortable with any physical touch. Sexual touch doesn't even have to be intercourse. It's just touch me in any way that feels sexual. And I just feel this revulsion inside. Some aren't able to ever achieve orgasm again. Some during sex, they just check out of their body. They feel distant. They dissociate. Others. They regularly have sexual flashbacks. Dreams about the sexual abuse. Intrusive thoughts about the sexual abuse. Others have actually physical pain in their sexual organs. That is an ongoing thing. And then others have shame. Sexual shame about what happened. Body shame about what happened. And there's huge ongoing results or ramifications. That come out of betrayal trauma related to sexual abuse. There's one other area that is significant for some. And that's where that betrayal trauma is experienced in your relationship with your higher power. That you feel has let you down. has betrayed you.

I hope you're really getting a feel for the fact that this betrayal trauma is huge. And it has massive ramifications. It's not just painful. It just messes up a whole bunch of life. For years and years and years. And what I hope you begin to realize is. Wow. You can heal from this. But it is going to take some work to heal from this. And it's going to take some special tools to heal from this. what are some of the tools that help people heal from betrayal trauma. And again I want to emphasize there's no quick fix. Healing from betrayal trauma is a slow, slow process. And it takes consistent work over a period of months. And years to begin to heal from this. number one. Acknowledge the betrayal. Don't keep trying to minimize it or avoid it. you have to start by validating I was betrayed. And it hurt crazy. start with that honesty. That sees it accurately and acknowledges it. That is painful. But that is the first step in beginning to heal. Secondly. Don't blame yourself. For a child to be betrayed is never the child's fault. don't blame yourself. develop self compassion. To that child and to yourself today. That is absolutely essential. Now if you've been betrayed. In adult life. And you are going back and wanting to heal from being cheated on. Your partner having spent all your money and didn't tell you about it. Learn from it. Go back and go. Why didn't I see the warning signs. Why was I attracted to somebody who's dishonest and who's that. What is it that I can learn from I don't repeat this in adult relationships. And is there something in me that's attracted to somebody that I need to look at. turn this into a huge growth opportunity. A time. A chance to really learn. Next thing is. Once you fully validate it. See it accurately. Expect. Now you're going to go through the stages of grief. You're going to go through shock. Anger.",

That's going to take months to get through. But it will follow the stages of grief process. The next thing is. Because what happens for children who've gone through betrayal trauma. Is they have to become blind to what's happened. They have to shut down emotionally. Disconnect from the emotions of it. They have to really learn. How to feel emotions. Identify emotions. Accept emotions. Value emotions. Express emotions. They have to learn emotional intelligence. And that begins by beginning to practice identifying your emotions. Naming your emotions. Feeling them in your body. Feeling them in your emotional world. And then accepting your emotions. begin to do that. I want to give a caution here. For a lot of people when they realize that they've been betrayed. They'll get a response from many -meaning people that want to pressure them. You need to forgive that person. And my response to that is. Don't let somebody pressure you into. You need to forgive. It doesn't work. What you need to do is. Allow yourself. To grieve the pain. Allow yourself to process through the pain of that betrayal trauma. Eventually you'll get to forgiveness. But after it's going to be the result of having worked through all of the pain honestly. And just be cautious of people that try to rush you to forgive before. Actually your brain is ready to forgive. The next piece is. Accept the fact. That rebuilding trust. And learning how to find safe people is going to be a slow process. You're not going to be able to meet somebody and immediately be able to go. , I can trust you 100. Not after you've been betrayed. You need to gradually get to know a person. And that's going to take months. And you're going to gradually trust them a little bit to see if they're trustworthy. If they are, then you're going to have to trust them. If they are, then you trust them a bit more. And then a bit more. And gradually trust builds. And we don't that slow process. Because when we're in that process. There's an element of the unknown. Are they going to be fully trustworthy. Are they going to maybe still let me down.",

You need professional help. Now I just give you a caution. That one of the things that if you get in a support group, which I hope you will, is that then you can be in danger of trauma bonding. you find out somebody else that's betrayed deeply in similar ways to you. And you have a connection. And all of a sudden you go, Oh, I just feel close to this person. But they're messed up. You're messed up. And you get in this relationship. And then you get betrayed again. just be aware of trauma bonding that can take place between two people that have gone through betrayal trauma. , this has been a tough topic.

    "output": "money in general for people no matter how healthy they are is a challenge money is this thing that's just a necessary part of life you can't live without it but it is very tricky to manage it might seem it's kind of an insignificant thing but you begin to realize that it is connected to just about everything we do and we can go wrong with money in a thousand different directions and the number one or number one cause of conflict the studies say in marriages today is money it causes all kinds of issues money is very easy to misuse and it's also very easy to develop the wrong attitude toward no matter who you are what i have learned over the years is if i want to know the priorities of a person watch what they spend their money on money reveals a lot about you and what's important to you that's just in general money is a challenge for everybody but it's an even greater challenge for people in recovery and i got quite a long list and some of you will relate to every single one of the points that i'm going to make but the first major issue around money in recovery is that money can be a true trigger to use and what i have seen over years in working with people in recovery is that for some people that very first payday once they're in recovery also becomes relapse day because they get that first paycheck and their brain goes to boy let's party the second thing that can happen with people is just even having money in your pocket is a trigger i know some addicts who when they get their paycheck they spend it all just to get rid of the money they're not going to be tempted they don't have any money left for groceries but they spend it all and the temptation is gone and money can be a huge trigger especially when you begin to look at meth being sold for less money and even having a little bit of money can be a problem but not just having money can be a trigger not having money can also be a trigger for some people and if you don't have money it can be a trigger to start your boosting career up again and getting some money or do a few bit of dealing deal some drugs get some quick money or turn a couple tricks and get some fast money and not having money can be a trigger and then for some people having a credit card or a debit card is just too big of a trigger it is something that they cannot handle if you're in recovery you probably relate to some degree to that and then on top of that is gambling addiction shopping addiction and all of that is money related now let's say you get in a relationship then you have money becomes this cause or source of conflict but also stress i don't know many people coming into recovery out of addiction who don't have debts they don't have a huge saving account that's all been gone they got a lot of debt and debt adds a lot of stress to life then for many people coming in out of complex trauma your brain is still in a state of constant gratification and part of what you've done in your life is just make lots of impulsive decisions you buy stuff before you've thought about it just because you feel buying it in that second of time and impulsive decisions can mean coming home with a new tv and laptop but then the stress that comes up after that and the conflict that comes after that is great and then some people get in a relationship and they spend a whole bunch of money and they come home and they didn't ask the other person if it was to go and spend 500 they just did it and now they've got a huge conflict i have found that the majority of people in recovery would brand themselves as poor money managers there's some that manage money but those who are not are not going to be able to manage their money and they tend to waste money and then struggle to pay bills all of that adds stress and creates conflict some who come out of complex trauma have hoarding issues and i'm going to talk about that a little bit later but that is tied in with the money thing and that can become a real problem for people who are in a complex trauma situation and i'm going to talk about that a little bit later but that is tied in with the money thing and that can become a source of great conflict not just with a partner but with family and friends as and then many people that come out of complex trauma even poverty and addiction can have a very distorted view of success and they can come into recovery thinking that if i just get enough money to buy what i want then i'll be happy their definition of happiness and success is tied into getting lots of money and they set themselves up for disappointment i also have encountered many clients who grow up in a family where parents have defined success by the possessions you own the house you live in and the child still gets pressure from the parent to have certain things to prove that they're successful and the parent wants the child to have it because that child is an embarrassment to the parent if they don't have it they get lots of pressure and our culture gives us the same message i have also found that many clients coming out of complex prom trauma and poverty often look at people with lots of money and because they wear a smile in public they think those are happy people and then they're envious of them and they walk around saying if i just had what they had then i would be happy and i often say do anything about their private life because just because they wear a smile doesn't mean they're happy but that is what can easily happen and one of the things that's really important to understand up front is this money is a big part of what is necessary to help my children that's what is needed and what is very easy to think is that more money is the solution to my problems i hope that's a lie that just having external things does not make me a happy person that happens from a healthy internal life not from more things now it's really hard for people in addiction to manage money when they come in and then they go out of their house and have to work again into recovery.",

You're not sure what mood dad's going to be in today. that is iffy all the time you walk on eggshells. Some of you don't know if you're going to have food to eat on any given day because mom and dad spend it all on drugs and alcohol. there's lots of fighting that makes life unstable. Parents aren't consistent. They're not a rock. And your life is marked by instability. And that is what creates some of the trauma. Because you feel a little child all alone facing all of this instability and you don't feel strong enough to handle it. you're traumatized by it. What is easy for people to do as they get older is think that if I have lots of money in the bank, then that will be what gives me stability. That is a lie. But it is really easy to think that because if you got lots of money in the bank, then you think I can handle anything that comes up that might make my life unstable. But again, it's looking for stability. In external only. And that will let you down. And many people begin to think, especially in our culture, that if I want a safe and stable and secure future, I need to squirrel all my money away that I'm prepared. Now it's wise to be prepared financially for the future if you can.

And that's what I want you to be aware of. , third thing that happens with complex trauma, you feel this constant emotion. Emotional emptiness and pain. And guess what money lets you do. Buy medication. You can buy drugs, alcohol, and activities and have endless distractions that take you out of the pain and give you some pleasure. And again, people can think money is the solution to my pain and money is solution to my emptiness. And then whenever you're discontent, money buys you stuff to do. Money gives you that high for a little while and it seems to fill the emptiness inside of you. Now be aware of another part of complex trauma, and that is you create a complex trauma in your kids, most likely. And what happens with that is you carry this guilt. And what can happen if you are discontent with that you feel you're going to have to pay back. , you're going to have to pay back. You're going to have to pay back. You're going to have to pay back. You're going to have to pay back. You're going to have to pay back. You're going to have to pay back. You're struggling to pay the bills.

    "output": "that's the first solution. With that, you then put on masks. they can't see the real me, I need to present to them something that they will or respect. I have to do an act or a role that they will say, wow, I that person. I want to be with that person. And you become a mask wearer. Some of you relate to being a chameleon. You wear a mask, a different mask for each person you meet. how to adjust your behaviour to get this person to you and how to make a different adjustment to get this person to you. You're very good at wearing masks. We teach about the roles that children develop as they grow up. you can see, you talk about the hero and the jester and the invisible child and the scapegoat child. I want you to think about those roles in terms of shame. Because one of the purposes of those roles is not just to help the family have less pain, it's to provide a solution to shame. the hero child says, they can't see the real me, mum and dad, because they will reject me. They will neglect me. I will be a hero. I will be super responsible. I will never cause problems. I will do extra chores. I will be cooperative with everything they want. I will never rebel. I will help out. Then mum and dad will love me and respect me. the child is trying to get love and respect within the family while hiding what they think is their real self. They are hiding what they think are defects. The second child is that invisible child that says, I don't want to be a burden to mum and dad. That's why they don't me. That's why they abuse me and neglect me. I will have zero needs. I will never ask for anything. I will never share with them my dreams or desires or wants. Because then I might be a burden. I have to somehow fade into the wallpaper and have zero needs or desires. Then maybe mum and dad will say, that's a good kid. And they will respect me and love me. still trying to solve shame. Then the jester child or the comedian says, I will hide behind humour. People won't see the real me.",

When a baby is born we desire as parents to connect with it. We have it driven for connection. As we get older we long for a partner or a deep intimate relationship where we can connect at the deepest level. It is wired into us. think of shame this way. Shame is the result of not being able to connect. what you might think of a time when you wanted to connect to mom or dad. Maybe you had a problem. Maybe you were hurting. Maybe you had a question and you went to mom and dad wanting to connect and talk about this deep issue that you were struggling with and they didn't reciprocate. They didn't let you connect. They didn't connect back. They were maybe too busy. Preoccupied. They just weren't interested. you tried to connect but there was no connection. What did you feel. Must be my fault. Maybe something's wrong with me that caused them to not want to connect with me. shame always results when a child is unable to connect with a significant authority figure in their life. what happens when a child is unable to connect with a significant authority figure in their life.",

    "output": "The first two, we do really in our culture. number one, medical detox and rehab. We're great at that. Number two, counseling and therapy. Both of those are thriving. What's missing. Number three, social connection. That's been ignored in our recovery world. Now she takes that even further,. The striatum is what gives us the source of hope. your striatum is your default setting. what she's now going to say is this. Your striatum, which has been changed to now say I don't need relationships, I just want drugs, it can be rewired. It can be reprogrammed by starting to give it deep social connections that it longed for in the first place. you can retrain it that it longs for deep social connections again. And if we do that, we need to practice social connective behaviors instead of compulsive behaviors. It's not enough to just teach healthier responses to cues from our social reward system. In other words, it's not enough just to give people tools to cope. We have to rebuild the social reward system with reciprocal relationships to replace the drugs which relieve the craving. Our culture and communities either create environments that are either full of things that cause addictions to thrive or full of things that cause relationships to thrive. I think that's powerfully very said. But the problem as I come to the end of that is our culture today is programmed to make addictions thrive. And we, if we are going to help people change, we have to create things. We have to create subcultures which are countercultures which reintroduce social connection. And that will reprogram the brain. And as the brain is reprogrammed and people are getting meaningful social connections, the desire for the opioids disappears. And that, I think, is very significant. But here's the trick with shame. Shame says, I want to connect. But as soon as you say, I'm going to try and connect, fear comes up. And it says, -oh, what happens if they find out I'm not perfect. -oh, what happens if they find out who I really am. what you're doing in recovering from shame is saying, I will risk connecting by walking through the fear of being found out. And I will trust that if I connect with the people, it will help me to heal. But that is a scary step. , second thing.",

    "output": "How does shame affect relationships. We just did a series on codependency, I don't want to go into great detail. But I want to recap for you how shame affects relationships. one way to understand codependency is it's two shame-based people trying to have a relationship together. That is the best definition of codependency. what happens is two people trying to hide who they really are. Two people of masks and walls who are trying to get their needs met, trying to get love and respect without revealing who they truly are. And that's why codependency has been called the dance of two shame-based people. Because they're dancing around trying to get their needs met, trying to not get the other person too angry, and that is an ongoing thing. what we have said is shame basically says I have no positive feelings about myself. Because I don't believe I have value or I'm lovable. if I am going to have any positive feelings about myself, they must come from others. I must put on an act but one of the things the brain says is if I'm in a relationship, that proves somebody me. That proves that I must be lovable. therefore, to deal with my shame, the brain says the solution is be in a relationship all the time. Because that will give you proof that somebody loves you, you must be lovable. What then is the problem if you're not in a relationship. And you're alone. Your brain goes, -oh, this is proof I'm not lovable. Therefore, I've got to run into a relationship. that's why many shame-based people, when they feel that their relationship is falling apart, they don't just break it off and sit alone for a while. They don't break it off until they have somebody else ready. Because they can't be alone because that would prove their deepest fear that they're not lovable. here's how it works out. you've got shame in the rectangle on the left, the blue rectangle. Then people respond to shame in different ways. some people respond by going to the gray oval at the bottom, the inferior position. I'm a nobody. I'm no good. And they just walk around with zero self-image. Others respond by trying to compensate. And they, they act they're better than everybody. And they go in the direction of being a narcissist.",

I have zero shame. Do you realize they got just as much shame as the other one. They're just hiding it better. And at some point if they don't start to see that they have shame too, they will keep needing the other person to be inferior. if the inferior person starts to deal with their shame and get healthy, that messes up the way the superior person wants this to operate.

    "output": "tonight I want to start a new series on shame. And I want to just give you a little bit of why I want to do this series to get you're understanding where I'm coming from. Fifteen years ago when I started working in the addictions industry, I was asked by my boss to prepare a brand new workshop for the treatment center I was in on the subject of shame. And I didn't have a clue what it was, I read the books that were available on shame and I put together a workshop. The first time I taught it, I saw the impact it had on people coming out of addiction and trauma. And I thought, wow, this is a big topic. But I also saw that it was a super heavy topic. By the end of the workshop, people were having all kinds of memories stirred up by the stuff we were talking. They were feeling pain at a deeper level than they had felt for a long time. And for a lot of people, it just became too much. It was overwhelming for them. The second thing I noticed is that some of the people before the workshop started said, I don't have any shame. And I started asking clients at the beginning of the workshops from that time on, how much shame do you have. And most of them said, I don't have any shame. And by the end of the workshop, they're saying, I got all kinds of shame. And what I realized, it was a topic that people didn't understand and were very unaware of any of it in themselves. But it was once they became aware of it, they began to see how it affected every area of their life. And they began to realize that this was going to be one of the most important areas for them to deal with. If they were. Going to make it in recovery. that's part of why I want to do this series, because what I have seen since react started and three years ago yesterday react began and what I have seen is the week that we do on shame for many people is one of the toughest weeks, but one of the most important weeks of their time at react. it is a poorly understood issue.",

Everybody from complex trauma has some shame. we're going to start the series, but I want to put this out up front. This may stir up some very painful stuff. If it does, you have my permission to tune me out for a while. you don't get overwhelmed. I can't do all of the. Material and one night I can't give you all the tools for healing in this first night, but those tools will come in ensuing nights that we are spending on this topic. if you are feeling overwhelmed, feel free to just tune out for a little while. Now, what I want you to understand is shame by definition is not an emotion. It is a core belief about yourself. It is a core belief about who you think you are. There will be emotions that go with that, that we call shame emotions, but at its core, by definition, shame is a core belief about myself. Who am I. That is the question. And what shame means is I have a negative view of myself. I see myself as not having a lot of value, not being very lovable. Therefore, I see myself as not being good enough and therefore less than others around me. I would say 100 of people with complex trauma have some shame. The greater the complex trauma, the greater the shame. But everybody with complex trauma has some shame. In other words, complex trauma affects your core belief about your identity. And it makes it a negative thing. I want to develop that tonight and just kind of give you some groundwork to help you understand this concept that you can begin to see the shame in yourself. what I do when I teach this week at REACT is I say to the clients, think of times when you feel not good enough. Think of times when you feel not lovable, less than. How would you draw a picture of yourself at that moment in time. And they'll start giving me their answers, but usually they go along the lines.

And I felt something was wrong with me why they had to buy me off with gifts. Second, why did nobody care enough about me to say no. If they really cared about me, they would have said no to some of the stuff. The fact they never said know makes me feel that I don't matter, that I'm not cared for. And that sends a negative message. We always talk about the four environments of complex trauma. neglect, parents who meet your physical needs but aren't there emotionally for you, that sends a message to you that something must be wrong with you. That's why they don't want to connect emotionally to you. Or you try to connect and you hit a wall and you conclude what's wrong with me. Then you might have come from a family where it was all about image. at home everybody hit each other and yelled at each other and fought. As soon as you went out in public, be polite. Treat me with respect. Don't have a hair out of place. Look good. And you began to feel, I'm just a trophy on dad's arm. I'm just here to make him look good. I'm not here because I matter for me. I'm here because it's all about him. And that sends a shame message to you. If you're not nurtured or your needs aren't met consistently, we talk about that all the time.

I must not be good enough. abuse sends one of the loudest, mere messages that something is wrong with you. And then abandonment, in my mind, sends the greatest shame message. if you think of the two people that gave you life, mom and dad, biological parents, if they don't want you and get rid of you, what does that say about you. If the two people who are to naturally have a built-in love for their offspring don't want you, that must mean you're a zero. And that nobody will want you if they get to know you. abandonment sends the heartache. I'm going to go ahead and read the first part of this. The first part is the most precious, deepest, most painful shame message. Conditional love is another one. Some days you're showered with love. Other days they withhold love, and you feel it's your fault. Shame-based parenting, that's when mom always is going, shame on you, shame on you, shame on you. She thinks it's going to motivate you to do better. But if that's all you hear, you're not going to get the message. You begin to believe you're just a screw-up. And it begins to be your belief system. A subtle one, and I want to go into a couple subtle ones now. Your parents' value system affects how you see yourself. if mom is all about still looking a 30-year-old when she's 50, you are getting a loud value message that says, women only have value if they're a great sex object. And that can come through loud and clear. Secondly, if dad is obsessed with his car, and it is his baby, and you can't sit in it, if you've got the speck of dirt on you, then you go, that car matters more than me. His value system is a fancy car. Where do I fit in. And that sends a message.",

I'm going to take you then, what does that do to a child. What emotions does that then create when they're made to feel not valuable, not lovable, not good enough. , you can imagine there's pain. Lots of it. There's fear. Will anybody want me. Will anybody respect me. And they have a lot of anxiety now. As they make friends, a lot of insecurities are now there. Many, with shame, become depressed because they don't themselves. Life sucks. They hate themselves. They are very hard on themselves. Some begin self-harming behaviors because they hate themselves much. They find out there's a lot of anger in there. They're jealous. They're jealous of anybody that has more attention than them. They're envious of what everybody else has. They get very negative about themselves and everybody else. And they're very discontent. And for some, they get to a place where they feel hopeless. I am a total screw-up. I don't see any way out of this. What's the point. what I want you to understand is shame does nothing but produce negative emotions and powerful negative emotions. Not mild ones, but powerful ones. And the emotional world of a shame-based person is predominantly negative emotions. And that is a difficult thing to live with because what happens with shame is you don't know how to fix it. You find no way to resolve it, there's no way to resolve the negative emotions. But let me add one more piece here. what happens to a child is if I do something that's below the standard,. let's say I go to school with a big pimple. I am going to be made to feel ugly, and that'll feed my shame, but it won't stop there. I'm going to get teased. I'm going to get a new nickname. I'm going to get made fun of.

Now if you're told through the mirrors that your real self is no good, that you're less than, that you're not lovable, you develop the gray area outside of that, the other circle, which is the shame-based self, and that's the critic.

You're never going to attain it. it compares what you're doing day by day with this ideal self, and what's the conclusion it's drawing.

Your brain just says, you loser, and they repeat all the things that your parent said. your parents once criticized you, but guess what happened as you grew up. You took your parents and stuck them into your brain, we call it an internal parent is now in your brain, and it's a critic. regardless of what you do, it will never be good enough to your brain. it's another way that shame sets up systems to prevent you from ever escaping shame because now you have your parents living in your head, judging everything you do with a shame message. Another way to understand that is as you grow up as a child, your parents said you're too sensitive. you say, I hate that about myself. And you say, I wish I could just find a way to cut that out of myself and throw it away. you say, I'm just going to shut that part of me down and never be sensitive again. I hate that about myself. And then a little while longer, you're angry nobody to be around you. Oh, now you, I hate my anger. I wish I could just get rid of my anger. And you shut that part of yourself down. Over time, guess what's happening. You're hating more and more of yourself. You're wishing you could take those parts, shut them away in a closet, and never have to do it again. You're going to have to deal with them again. you are taking your parents' messages and now you're shaming yourself. You're keeping it going. And that's the challenge with shame. Final thing and then we'll end. What's the difference between shame and guilt. Very important question. Guilt is about what you do.",

    "output": "Shame is about who you are. Guilt is about actions. Shame is about identity. Guilt is actually a wonderful system where we have this thing called a conscience that if we do something that violates love, we feel pain. if we tell a lie, if we cheat somebody, cheat on somebody, steal, something bugs us. That's guilt. It was designed to be a good system that was designed to be a good system to say, are you in enough pain yet to smarten up and change your behaviour. To get back to telling the truth, to being honest. guilt's a wonderful system to correct unloving behaviour and make it loving again. guilt is resolvable. Shame is not resolvable. It is saying you're not good enough and there's nothing you can do about it. You just have to live with that identity and all the emotions you feel around that identity. shame is the problem area because you can't find a way to fix it. Now I've got to add false guilt because in complex trauma families, your conscience was often misguided or miseducated. dad was saying, you're selfish for wanting to play baseball and you go, it's wrong to play baseball, bad me. That's a misguided conscience but now you feel guilt every time you want something. And part of recovery is learning true guilt from false guilt. , final thing. Once you have a lot of shame and then you do something wrong, you get guilt,. But what does guilt do now. I did something bad, I am bad. guilt now feeds shame. if you've got lots of shame, I don't feel good enough, I'm bad, I'm not lovable, you steal from somebody, you feel guilt, but then you go, oh, that just proves how bad I am. those feed each other. I knew going into shame was going to be a little bit of a pick me up because it is such a heavy topic. I thought I would tell you some stories from the about screwed up people and how viewed those people to just help you understand that just because you have shame doesn't mean 's going to put you on the shelf or that doesn't see you as having value. And that's the fear of a lot of people with shame.",

    "output": "welcome to another Friday night. I want to do another talk on the prisons that come out of complex trauma and I want to look at one tonight that's not going to apply to everybody but I think you might be surprised at how many people it does apply to and it's people that engage in criminal behavior and I'm not talking necessarily about hardened criminals I'm talking about some good people that still engage in some criminal behavior and the purpose of this talk is not to be judgmental it's not to go on a rant or moralistic crusade about all of that stuff it's it's really to understand that what the research is showing is that people that end up in continuing criminal behavior over 90 percent have complex trauma and the criminal behavior was not the only one that was involved in the criminal behavior. It was the people that were involved in the criminal behavior that were involved in the criminal behavior. And the criminal behavior was not the only one that was involved in the criminal behavior. And the actually a way to cope with the deep emptiness and pain inside it was a way to try to get some needs met and it became a pattern of behavior that was designed to help them survive but they didn't realize it was a maladaptive behavior they didn't realize that it was going to start causing them trouble and what happens for many people is that they do this criminal behavior and then they get caught and then they stop but they don't realize that they're going to get caught and then they stop but they don't realize that they're going to get caught but some even though they say but some even though they say I'm never going to do this again this was terrible getting caught something in them keeps them going back and pretty soon they find that it's a prison to them they can't seem to escape it they part of them wants to escape but part of them keeps being drawn back to it and what we know is that the rate of recidivism or re-offending or going back to criminal behavior technically is 30 to 50 percent and that's the way it is.",

It comes to the high Spirit and we have height, age, ethnicity, personality and the difference betweenned. What makes proszęhh the success in chasing criminals and counters. then I just wanted to end here by giving a little bit of an example around crime and Alright probably if you for заap medications prepared plenty of seniors and resources that can treat it but it's very bound to some, this excuseacy comes from the fact that there might be a majority that's not necessarily a ban on ne' s insurance. common behavior that they just get drawn back into over and over again. Then there's the drug dealer that we easily think of, people that get involved in gangs and organized crime, but then robbery, scamming, the con man, the hustler, then people that just, I'm going to go turn a trick and that way I'm going to get some easy money. Then there's pimping and human trafficking, and then vandalism, crimes against property, property damage, arson. all of those are different types of criminal behavior and there's a spectrum of severity that you can see there, but they're all different types of criminal behavior. I think it's helpful in looking at this topic to really approach it that there's kind of three, three levels that we need to look at to understand this properly.",

There's, because of the complex trauma, there's unresolved needs, there's unresolved pain, there's an emptiness. And what can happen is a fantasy belief that starts in the child's mind that says, if I had more money, if I was rich, if I had more things, then I would be happy. And that can set a child up to begin to think that criminal activity is the best way to get lots of money and things, and then I'll be happy. it's based on that. Deep, complex trauma where their needs weren't met, where there was a discontent due to abuse or neglect. The second one was a child who grows up who doesn't attach to parents in a secure way. there's not a secure attachment. they don't feel part of this family. They feel on the outside a black sheep. they long to connect. They long to feel they belong somewhere that they fit in. they will then be able to feel the way they want to feel. And that's what we're going to look at now. that's the first one. fit in. they will then go to their next sphere of influence outside the family, which is their peer group, and they will try to fit in with a group of peers. And if that group of peers is into being bad boys, then they will try to fit in there. if that need for connection is not met at home, they will be very vulnerable to go and get it met in a peer group that may not be healthy. And it could lead to criminal activity. Another thing that happens often in complex trauma is the child develops shame. I don't feel good enough. That's why I'm being neglected. That's why I'm being abused. That's why nobody's connecting with me. If I'm authentic, I get rejected and abandoned. I feel less than, not good enough. And how do I feel better about myself. , I need more money. I need. I need the respect of my friends. I need on and on. they begin to look to external things as the way to get respect and friends.

That I can do what I want, the rules don't apply to me, I'm better than everybody, I'm entitled and that becomes again a prime candidate. For criminal behavior. there's a narcissistic element that is being formed out of the deep shame and pain of complex trauma. Somebody has put it into kind of four categories. family related risk factors, that's what we've just described. All of the complex trauma that comes out of an abuse and neglect environment. Secondly, school related risk factors. a child that just doesn't achieve and do very in school or a child who's bullied or becomes a bullier, they are more prone to criminal behavior. And a child that just skips school a lot, doesn't care about school, they are more prone to fall into criminal behavior. Then that goes to community risk factors. a disadvantaged neighborhood, a very poor run-down neighborhood, not a whole lot of organizations within the community for the child to participate in, a community that's just neglected by the government and it's just run down. All kinds of garbage, disrepair happening, there's an availability of drugs, there's gangs that are happening, there's a high turnover within those communities, and there's no closeness in the communities, you just don't do things, in a way that's not good. you have to keep that in mind, as you're dealing with the problems. You don't want to just go back and forth and say oh, I'm , that's enough, that's enough, that's enough, that's enough, that's enough, that's enough, that's enough. There's no vulnerability to the community. things together. That sets up a child to be a higher risk for criminal behavior. And then the peer risk factors. And a child that doesn't feel connected at home then is prone to peer pressure and getting into gangs, etc. Hanging around with friends that are involved in criminal behavior, that condone criminal behavior, early involvement in criminal behavior, having all of their friends who've got problem behaviors, people that just aren't as smart and they just aren't thinking about a future, a career. They're just trying to survive.",

You can talk to them and they'll talk about a thousand subjects, but nothing deeply honest, deeply personal, being open and vulnerable is taboo. And that leads to them being very much alone. They might be surrounded by people, but they feel totally alone. And then sexuality is an interesting one for many of them. And that is they have lots of sex, but they don't have satisfying sex. Sex becomes about conquest. Sex is seeing another person as their possession that they own. But sex is no longer that attachment. But sex is no longer that attachment. But sex is no longer that attachment. But sex is no longer that attachment. But sex is no longer that attachment-based satisfying sex. The final one is super optimism. if they get an idea, they immediately think, I can do this. I can pull this off. This is going to happen. And it's as good as done in their mind to get an idea about a crime, etc. They're super optimistic. They can get rid of all the doubts, all the fears, all the misgivings, and get to this super optimistic place. What happens and what is important to understand is that when many of these people actually get caught and go into recovery and say, I want to change, many still have that mindset. And what they think is, I'm going to be successful in recovery. I've made up my mind and I'm going to do it. They don't think about what do I need to change. They don't think about the hard work of recovery. They don't think of the thousands of things that I need to change. They don't think of the thousands of decisions that are going to have to be made that are different from how they would have made those decisions in the past. They just think, I made up my mind.

You are in shock. You just can't believe it. Then you can go to a deep grief. You are just overwhelmed with a deep sadness, often even a hopelessness. Life just is negative, painful, dark. But then you can go to that deep anger, rage, then you can go to just fear. What now. What's going to happen in my life. And everything is scary. And then you can get paranoid and almost have this kind of terror that you live with. Some go to guilt. I must have done something wrong. It's probably my fault. And that's that self-blame stuff that we just talked about. Others go, it triggers their shame at a deep level. See, that proves I'm not worth anything. I'm not lovable. I'm not valuable.

Then it can lead to just this haunting loneliness that the person I thought loved me has betrayed me. I am all alone and it is overwhelming. And then often a deep feeling of being violated. Then another thing that begins often to happen emotionally with people is after they've been betrayed, they have a great deal of difficulty regulating their emotions. all of a sudden, they have massive mood swings. They have massive mood swings. They have massive mood swings. They have huge mood swings several times a day, or they get triggered and they just go from zero to 100 in a nanosecond and they can't stop it. emotional regulation becomes a problem.

There's one other thing that happens with betrayal trauma that includes sexual abuse and that is there's sexual symptoms in the future and there can be an aversion to sex. Sex just makes me feel dirty. Sex makes me feel awful. It's disgusting and it just triggers much painful stuff. I don't want sex or if I do have sex it's just I do it out of obligation. It's not something I enjoy but I do it out of obligation. Some become just uncomfortable with any physical touch, sexual touch. Doesn't even have to be intercourse. It's just touch me in any way that feels sexual and I just feel this revulsion inside. Some aren't able to ever achieve orgasm again. Some during sex they just check out of their body. They feel distant. They dissociate. Others they regularly have sexual flashbacks, dreams about the sexual abuse, intrusive thoughts about the sexual abuse. Others have actually physical pain in their sexual organs. That is an ongoing thing and then others have shame, sexual shame about what happened, body shame about what happened and there's huge ongoing results or ramifications that come out of betrayal trauma related to sexual abuse.

They will agree to go to counseling with you. You've confronted them. You've just had a blow-up. You say, we need help. Unless you go to counseling, it's over with. They will go to counseling with you, and you have hope. But what happens in the counseling is, as a narcissist, they are very smooth. They are very charming. They are very logical. They get the counselor on their side. They convince the counselor that you're the problem, that they're the sane one, and they convince. And spin a picture that the counselor believes, and pretty soon what has happened is you feel ambushed because now the counselor is on the side of the narcissist against you as the problem. It backfires big time. Another thing that they will do is they will take a course. they could take our Lyft course. They could read books on relationships, read books on trauma, take a course on trauma, and you get your hopes up. Oh, they want to learn. They want to learn. , not for the reasons you think. They don't want to learn they can change. They don't want to learn they can see what they're doing. They want to learn they learn the language, they know how to use it as a weapon against you, they know how to twist it that they can now push, play with your thinking, and distort your thinking, and get you to see that it's your problem. That happens often. Next thing that they can do is you have a big blow up. You threaten if you don't get help. And we got to go to counseling. they go to counseling.

    "output": "Instead of beating yourself up and say, oh, I got to stop this approval seeking or attention seeking. Why do I do that. Where does this come from. kind of three big things that come out of complex trauma. number one, it's parents that weren't attuned to the child's emotional needs. And your emotional needs were not seen and therefore met. secondly, that's another way of saying you experience some type of neglect. You did not receive the attention you should have from your parents. It could be they were workaholics. It could be they were narcissists. Could be they were very insecure driven. Or it could be not that they did it intentionally, but you were in a very large family. Or they had their own family business and it demanded all of their time. Or they had chronic health problems or mental health problems. And they just weren't able to be there for you. Another part of this is every child needs validation. That's one of our emotional needs. They need to be told you're good at that. Hey, you are this way. You did a great job there. That's how a child learns who they are. That's how a child begins to get a good positive self-identity. But some parents grew up in an era where they were told that if you validated your children, they would get a big head. They would become proud. They would get a big ego. And parents purposely didn't validate their children wanting to keep them humble. But it had the reverse effect. It created shame. based on inaccurate teaching, parents often did not validate their children sufficiently. what happens for a child whose need for validation is not met in a consistent way is they can go in one of two directions. they can suppress the need for validation. basically that means suppress. They can suppress all of my needs. Because if I express my needs, and I should get validation, but rather I get rejection, I get punishment, in other words I get pain, therefore let's become invisible. Let's not need validation. Let's not have needs. Let's make no demands. children this often become invisible children. They develop a rich fantasy world. They become a loner. They become self-sufficient. That's what they need to do to not go through the pain of not being validated.",

They're going to get validation for being the smartest kid in the class, the best athlete. They're not going to get validated for what really matters in life. They're only going to get validated for what fits the parent's value system. What the parents deem as the marks of success. Other children, if they grew up with abuse, if they grew up with bullying, if they grew up with abandonment issues, they're going to get shame through those avenues. And then, what happens with shame. I need others to approve me. I need others to see me. And mainly neglect can bring it. But abuse and abandonment can also bring this about because it produces the same shame issue. Another thing that can happen for many children is they might have got little bits of validation, but the predominant thing they got from their parents was criticism, judgment. They were always finding fault with everything they did. Nothing they did was ever good enough. And the child was just driven to try to get approval, to be desperate for approval. Another one is if you had a parent who was a narcissist. They were living this life trap out in their own life. And that was your role model. That was your normal. And that's what you grew up with and you developed. Another common thing that happens within complex trauma is children begin to realize they're kind of viewed as a perfect doll. And they're pretty, they're behaved, they're pleasing. They're kind of a pretty doll on a shelf that everybody just admires. Everybody just sees them a certain way. They see them based on their physical behaviors and their physical appearance. Nobody actually sees the real them for who they really are. They only see the externals and then assume that this is who they are. But actually they see them through a fantasy lens of who they want them to be.

Some children are given by their parents roles. in complex trauma, we talk about children developing roles to try to not get hurt, to try to get their needs met, to try to fix the family. But sometimes in complex trauma, children are assigned roles without even being told they're assigned roles. They just gradually pick up that they're expected to live a certain way. some are expected to be there. They're expected to be the hero. But some children are assigned the role or expected to be invisible. That you're going to be the child that never makes demands. You're going to be the child that's going to be the flower on the wall. That's just there, pretty, no demands, invisible. And many children have grown up feeling that subtle, constant expectation that they're never to draw attention to themselves, never to express needs, never to make demands, never be a burden. That's just what was passed on to them. Others, they had a sibling who was put into the hero role or the comedian role. And they got tons of validation from everybody for being such a wonderful child, for being funny. But you weren't assigned the comedian role or the hero role. you didn't get any validation. Some children, they learned that the only way they would get noticed was not by being good, by not doing positive things. Their parents wouldn't give them validation for that. the only way they would get noticed is by being bad, by creating a crisis, by doing stuff the parents didn't want them to do. Then all of a sudden they got the attention they were seeking, the attention they would not get by being good. Some children were only validated for one thing. Their brains, their looks, their body, their being funny, their being good at sports. And when they realized, I don't get any validation in life except for my athletic ability, my brains, my looks. They then made this commitment. I am going to be a pro. I am going to be the best at this. I am going to put all my effort and all my attention into developing this ability.",

And that became their obsession. what I want you to see is that all of these things, can you see the shame component. All of the stuff that came out of neglect, not being validated, produced shame. Now all the other things that the parents did produced shame. shame is the underlying element here. And approval seeking, attention seeking, is all driven by shame. It's all trying to solve shame. But it doesn't work. shame is this underlying issue. instead of it working to solve shame, instead of it working to get positive validation, to get positive admiration, it begins to have the opposite effect. we talked about, you begin to not know who you are, because you're trying to please everybody else and be what they want. you lose your sense of identity. You don't even know what your needs are, what your thoughts are, your feelings are after a while. Then you're not able to truly connect with people, because true connection requires authenticity. And you don't know what that is. And you begin to realize that your relationships are all rather superficial. Then people start getting tired of you always wanting approval or seeking attention. And they stop giving it to you. They set boundaries. They end the relationship, because you're wearing them out. Sometimes people begin to realize they're doing things for attention or approval that actually goes against their own deep values and beliefs. now they're being hypocrites. Now they're doing stuff that's causing them to feel guilty. And it creates deeper and deeper insecurity. Because all of my good feelings are dependent on others now. And I'm always worried about, are they going to approve today. What do they think about this. What about that. Deeper and deeper insecurity, which causes deeper and deeper stress. In everyday life.",

It leads to all of these connections that are unhealthy. It leads to adaptations that are unhealthy. It leads to lies and beliefs that are unhealthy. And recovery is figuring that out and learning, I got to let go of a whole bunch of unhealthy stuff. let's look at how do we do that. What's involved in letting go. I have to say up front is be patient with yourself. Go slow in this process of letting go. I don't know anybody that just sits down one day and figures out exactly what's going on. What's going on exactly what they need to let go and let's go of it in one day. It just doesn't work that way. Letting go is a process. It's a process first of figuring out what I need to let go, what part's healthy, what part's unhealthy, and then coming to a point where I'm able to let go. Because sometimes we know something is unhealthy. We know something we need to let go of. We just know we're not in a place where we can let go. And it's going to take time before we get to the point where we're finally we're just able to let go. We can't force ourself in some cases to let go of something that we have such a strong bond with. let me give you a few things about why this is a slow process, why we have to be patient with it. The first thing is that our brain, the limbic brain and the cortex, they let go on different schedules. your cortex can actually feel it. It can figure out academically, see stuff academically, weigh out the pros and cons, see the negative consequences, and say, that should be let go. And it can do that very quickly. It's the limbic brain that causes the problem. Because the limbic brain, the emotional part of the brain, is what developed an emotional attachment to something unhealthy. Because it seemed to work. It has a lot of emotional memories of the good things that came out of that.",

But now I realize I can't stop people pleasing unless I heal my shame. it's I reach a new level of where I need to let go of, but it only makes me aware of an even deeper level. That I gotta let go of. A new level means a new devil. That is frustrating and that is hard. And then the final one is every time I go to change and I step into this new unknown and I let go of stuff, it actually triggers fear. What will happen next. Will I fail. Will I be able to do this. Is this really healthy. Fear becomes something I have to walk through every time I make a change. Every time I let go of something, it triggers fear. And that makes people want to go back to what feels safe. let me take you to the next thing. Don't try to tackle everything you have to let go of at once. Tackle one thing at a time. And it can be a person or a thing. let's say you realize I've got a person in my life. Yes, there's a really unhealthy attachment. Maybe they have some good in that relationship. There's a lot of unhealthy. Or maybe this person is totally toxic. I got to totally cut them out of my life. Don't try to sort that out with every person. Do it with one person at a time. Now the fear for many people is that every relationship that has an unhealthy element, it's all or nothing. I got to get rid of them all. Totally kick them to the curb. No, it doesn't work that. There's going to be some people that are toxic. You have to cut them out of your life. But that's rare. For the most part, the people in your life, you might have. let's take your parents. You still want a relationship with them. There's still a lot of good things in that relationship. But there are some unhealthy things. You depend on them too much. You put your needs below theirs. You don't set boundaries with them. You let them take advantage of you. You let them disrespect you. And you realize if I'm going to get healthy, I have to change that. I have to set boundaries.",

What you do now is go to those parts and say thank you for the job you did. Thank you for serving this vulnerable child. But I want you to know that I've now developed tools to protect that child myself. I'm glad to still have you. I'm glad to still have you around, but I don't need you to feel responsible now to take care of that child. I'm going to give you kind of your retirement papers because I now have the tools to protect this child. And if you're able to see that all of these adaptations were just kind of parts all designed to protect the child, you're not getting down on yourself and being judgmental and critical, but you're just beginning to understand and explore that, wow, this brain of mine was sophisticated in trying to protect me. Now I'm just changing that I have better tools to protect myself now. Let me give you two final things. Letting go of all of these things, people, things, activities, always results in an element of grieving. I'm losing something that used to be important in my life. I will probably, probably have a time of grieving. Allow yourself that. But finally, recovery is not just about letting go of unhealthy. Recovery to be true recovery has to be all about forming healthy attachments, replacing the unhealthy attachments with healthy people, healthy activities. Make that your focus. Just don't focus on breaking and letting go of unhealthy things. Don't focus on healthy attachments. Really focus on forming healthy attachments.

I want to do a little mini series, short chats on some more narcissism stuff. I've done talks on narcissism in the past that I've really tried to explore it in depth, but I just wanted to add a few things that I've picked up over the years that I thought I'd put into short videos. Today I'd to talk about what's the results of being in a relationship with a narcissist for a period of time. How does it affect the person. And this could be, being in an intimate relationship where there's a partner, a husband, a wife, whatever, or it could be a parent or grandparent that you were in a relationship with for years, or it could be a boss or a religious leader that claims to represent , and then you do all you can to please them and have a relationship with them as your or leader. How does that affect you. And I would say there's a real good chance that you have complex trauma or complex PTSD as a result of that. Because what happens when you're in a relationship with a narcissist is that you're always on guard, you're always feeling a certain element of lack of safety or danger or something might happen. And over time, that begins to take its toll and you get complex trauma. Now, some of you might get, a little bit resistant to that and go, I don't think that's going to, that's what happened to me. And what I'd to do today is just to give you a very basic test that you can apply to yourself, hopefully with an open mind, just to see if these characteristics apply to you. And then at the end, we'll talk a little bit more about it. what are the indicators that a person has complex PTSD. And if you come out of a relationship with a narcissist, you're going to be in a relationship with a narcissist. And you're going to be in a relationship with a narcissist. And you have these characteristics, then you go, where did these characteristics come from.",

But you've been in an environment of threats of actual violence. And you've been exposed to violence, of actual violence as part of that relationship. And then some of the emotional and psychological results that would come out of that would be hypervigilance that you've never had before. now you're always looking for danger, scanning the environment, the horizon, feeling you're walking on eggshells. And that can go on even after the relationship has ended. And then you have recurrent, involuntary, intrusive memories of events that happened. They just pop into your head. Or you have emotional flashbacks. suddenly something's happening in your life today that triggers all this flood of emotions. And they're all negative emotions, fear, worthlessness, shame, panic, all of that gets triggered and comes rushing in. And always the result is that there's an increased shame that you have a lower self image. Deep down you don't feel anybody would want you. You feel anybody that gets to know you is going to abandon you or reject you. You feel you're too much or you're not enough or you're just unlovable. Those lies have just deepened in their beliefs in you. Their intensity in you as a result of this relationship. And then there's a persistent guilt that follows you around. you hear all of the words of the narcissist in your head. Their criticisms, their blame, all the things they tried to make your fault. And you're wondering if maybe they were. That it's somehow your fault. That somehow you should have been able to fix it. If only you had tried more things. You probably could have fixed it. there's just this nagging guilt all the time. And then there's what we would call identity erosion. You're not sure anymore who you are. You don't know who you are apart from the relationship. You've kind of absorbed the narcissist's view of you that you're nothing without them. That you can't do anything. That they, you can't think properly. You don't know who they are. They don't seem to care about what you do. They're not your friends.",

And that leads to difficulty making decisions because your fear of making the wrong decision, your fear that you're not smart enough to make a good decision, your fear you're going to get punished if you make the wrong decision.

Or they're afraid they're going to get attacked. They're going to get these long, I told you sermons, and it's just going to be more painful. Or they're just too tired. They're depressed. They just don't want to deal with people. And they just, it's easier to isolate.

    "output": ", welcome to another Friday night. Tonight I want to talk about a term that gets used a lot in recovery and sometimes gets misunderstood and it's the term letting go. And just to illustrate it, I came across somebody that was asked to just evaluate a treatment program that they had gone through and their comment was just to me very thought-provoking. They said, it seems if I'm going to recover I got to let go of everything. I got to let go of all the people of my life. I let go of all the activities that I used to do. I got to let go of all the places I used to go to. Just everything I have to let go. this term letting go has become really kind of a buzz term, a faddish term. And what tends to happen when you get buzz terms is they get overworked. And then as a result of that you get people that attach what they think is the meaningfulness of the treatment program to the patient. And that's what I'm going to talk about today. It's shallow. It doesn't have the whole meaning. And misunderstandings develop and that's what I think has happened with letting go. just to help kind of appreciate what this person was going through, what they were saying was when they think of this stuff that they're told they got to let go of people, activities, different things in their life, they said I wouldn't have a problem letting go of something if it was all bad. If it was all bad, if it was all bad, if it was all bad, if it was just very obvious, it did me zero good, it hurt me only. But the things that I have to let go of, some of the people, they had some bad parts that led me in bad directions. But they were also some really good people that helped me, that met some of my needs, that were a source of safety at times, that helped me survive. There was some good stuff that happened with those people. There was some good connection. There wasn't just bad.",

And I just say yes to drinking when people offer me stuff. And then I get drawn into addiction. those are the reasons why I ended up an addict. Again, what they're thinking is if I can just learn to say no, if I'm just not as party crazy, then all of my addiction issues will go away. And I go, no, that's missed the point again. Or I've had people say to me, the reason I hit my partner is because I got some anger issues. If I can just learn to control my anger, I won't hit my partner anymore. In their minds, what they are thinking as they've diagnosed themselves is I need to let go of one thing because there's only one thing that's causing all of my problems. I need to let go of that. And that's, I think, the most important thing. And that's, I think, the most important thing. Very simplistic way of looking at things. It's based on misdiagnosing the picture. And it seldom works. It seldom brings about true recovery, true healing. What they need to be able to do is expand their perspective to get some help in diagnosing their problem, to see the deeper issues underneath the things that they have diagnosed as the problem. And to begin to realize that there's many things that are also part of this problem, even thousands of things that all contribute to this problem. Those are the things that they're going to have to look at letting go, changing the relationship with if they want to make it in recovery. Let me give you a second perspective. And it's based on the teachings of Buddha, which has been helpful to many people in recovery. one of the, in very simplistic terms, one of the things that Buddha emphasized was that many of the problems that people struggle with in life is because they've developed an unhealthy attachment to a something, an activity, a person, a thing. And if they are going to get healthy and happy, they have to let go of unhealthy attachments. let me give you some examples based on what Buddha witnessed in his own culture. people developed an attachment to things.",

If you got them still, they kind of have to arrive be working for you. And how you get people to bring your speech out. It's not based on facts. It's based on a misunderstanding about happiness. And if a person is going to get truly happy, they got to be able to let go of all of these things that they're making the basis of their happiness. Other people, Buddha realized, formed unhealthy attachments with people. It resulted in them being overly dependent on a person to meet all of their needs. That then prevented them from growing up. That resulted in stunted growth. That resulted in an inability to think for themselves, to make decisions for themselves. That resulted in being willing to put up with stuff in a relationship that was very unhealthy, that kept them unhealthy, and refusing to grow up and change because they didn't want to lose the relationship. And an unhealthy attachment to another person could do a lot of damage to a person. And the whole point that Buddha was focusing on was if you are going to get healthy, if you are going to be truly happy, you have to let go of unhealthy attachments. Now he didn't use the language that we would use today. But what he was wanting people to realize is, letting go is a huge part of getting healthy.

    "output": "Now, I just want to comment on this because a lot of people, I think, have taken what Buddha taught and really focused, I think, in a way that's out of balance. And it's basically let go of everything. You don't need anybody. You don't need anything. Just let go, let go. Then you'll be happy. What the researchers showed, what Buddha was showing us, and this to me is critical for people in recovery, is yes, part one is I need to let go of unhealthy attachments, but there's a part two. And part two is I need to create healthy attachments. I need to attach to the things and have a healthy relationship with those things and those people. And I'm letting go of unhealthy attachments, that I can replace them with healthy, with even better things. That is the key to recovery. it's not just focusing on the negative. Oh, you got to let go. You got to let go. It's no, you got to let go of unhealthy attachments. It's about attachments. Am I attached to unhealthy things in unhealthy ways. If that's the case, let it go. It's all about developing healthy attachments. You can't let go of unhealthy attachments. You can't recover without healthy attachments. That is critical. Now, as always, I want to bring in the complex trauma piece, because this to me sheds the greatest light on this letting go. It helps people really understand what this letting go is all about. in my mind, what comes out of complex trauma is a whole bunch of things that I develop, attachments to, I connect to that aren't healthy. And recovery is realizing all of the hundreds and thousands of things that I have developed unhealthy attachments to, and realizing if I'm going to get healthy, I got to let go of this person, the unhealthy parts. I got to let go of this activity, the unhealthy parts. I got to let go of this thing, the unhealthy parts. And I have to let go of this activity, the unhealthy parts. And I have to find healthy. let me explain that. several aspects that come out of complex trauma. number one, we connect to things that aren't healthy. we have said over and over again that the greatest drive that a child is born with is to connect, to attach.",

    "output": "they should be getting from a person but there's not it's not happening with people let's try to get the feelings from things they might have a teddy bear a blanket they might get a new bike and that bike just makes them feel good it gives all the positive feelings that they should have got from people but now they get from a thing then it goes beyond that they then develop activities that are soothing that give them really good feelings that help them disconnect from the pain of their day-by-day existence that help them not have to be present in the pain of their day by day but escape that pain for a while and have good feelings they might escape to a fantasy world they might just play video games all day and that takes them out of their world they might eat food and food gives them the good feelings and takes them out of the world they might find masturbation and that takes them out and gives them all the good feelings they might get into porn they might get into sports or even extreme sports and adrenaline rush stuff but they begin to find activities that give them all the good feelings give the feelings that are really good and they develop connections they attach to those activities as being lifelines as being necessary things for them to get their needs met to be happy and then part of what develops with that is they're witnessing the world around them is they begin to develop beliefs that if i have this type of success if i have this much money this much position if i have this body if i have these possessions if i have this friend group they develop an image of what they think will make them truly happy and then they develop an attachment to that image to the status that they think they need what i want you to realize is what comes out of their life are certain things complex trauma is the child is still driven to connect and if they can't connect in a healthy way with mom and dad they will find other things to connect with and those things will not give true secure attachment they will give some of the feelings but they will leave their soul empty but they will still connect with it because it does give positive stuff but it will lead to great heartache down the road what that means in recovery is that if you're going to get healthy then you have to let go of the unhealthy connections with unhealthy people with unhealthy activities with unhealthy things now the problem is that if you're going to get healthy is that with a lot of those things there was some aspects of them that were healthy playing a video game eating food having sex there's a healthy part to that but you've attached to it in a way that you've overdone it and you've overused that to try to meet needs it wasn't designed to meet and now you have an unhealthy aspect to that connection you've got some healthy connection stuff happening but lots of unhealthy connection stuff and for you to get healthy it's for you to begin to realize i have to separate what part of this is healthy what part of this is unhealthy i can maintain a relationship with this thing in a healthy way but i need boundaries now that i don't slide into the unhealthy relationships what i might find in some cases is this person or this activity or this thing is totally unhealthy it is totally toxic for me i need an extreme boundary where i cut it out of my life but for most things i am going to find a change in boundaries i'm not going to have the old boundaries that allowed healthy and unhealthy i now i'm going to have new boundaries that will only allow the healthy and cut out the healthy and that is the thing that i'm going to find a change in boundaries i'm not going to have a change in boundaries that will only allow the healthy and cut out the healthy and that is the thing that i'm going to find a change in boundaries i'm not going to have a change in boundaries that takes a ton of work and time to figure out but that is recovery now let me show you a second part of complex trauma not only are all these connections happening that are unhealthy they're adaptations coping behaviors that are happening that are allowing the child to survive to protect them from being hurt to try and get their needs met and what you find is some of the adaptations the parents approve of other adaptations that parents don't approve of and the adaptations that get validation from parents you develop a special attachment to those are the hardest to let go let me give you some examples of some of the adaptations and again many of them have a mix of healthy and unhealthy a child who might be naturally funny and that gets validation from their parents might just conclude they need to be funny all the time or a child might conclude that to stay safe they have to always be in control and they work to become control of everything and everybody or and they're going to survive and get their needs met they need to be a people pleaser they need to learn to read the rules and they need to be able to be a good person and they need to be able to be a good person but sometimes or nice findings of their own and then get to work and get a bit of

And then I'll get my needs met. what I want you to see is all of those adaptations got the child validation, kept the child safe. Got their needs met. And a child will develop a super strong attachment to that because it seems to work. It's not until 20 to 30 years later that they begin to realize that all of these adaptations that kept me safe physically are now maladaptations. They are not working now. I'm not able to have an intimate relationship because I don't trust. I'm not able to have a relationship with a child because I'm a control freak because I suppress all my feelings. It is causing me all kinds of problems. what I thought was a great adaptation now is hurting those I love now is hurting me now is preventing healthy relationships in my life. when you stop and think about that. Most people from complex trauma. I've got hundreds of adaptations. That are really maladaptations. They kept them safe physically. But now they're preventing a healthy life, healthy relationships, and they're hurting those you love and yourself. to get healthy means to let go of all the unhealthy adaptations. That is a lot of letting go. That is a lot of figuring out. I adapted by people pleasing. But that doesn't mean that I should never. Please anybody. I now have to figure out when it's healthy to please people when it's unhealthy to please people. I can be in control or I can be funny, but I can take it too far. I can go from healthy funny to unhealthy all the time funny. I can go from healthy control to unhealthy control. I have to figure out healthy use a healthy adaptation versus an unhealthy maladaptation. And that is hard to do, especially when you've spent the last 20, 30 years thinking it was a great adaptation when it seemed to be working for you. But now you've got to figure it out and let go. , there's a third thing that comes out of complex trauma, and that is beliefs and values that are basically lies.",

That they live in that they develop a whole set of beliefs that seem to be the truth, but they actually prevent a healthy life in a safe environment. again, let me give you some examples. What comes out of complex trauma is a child begins to believe that if you see the real me, you're going to reject me. You're going to abandon me. Therefore, never be authentic or authenticity does not result in connection. It causes people to reject me. you're going to be fake. You're going to be fake. You're going to be fake. But being fake results in connection. be fake or you can't trust anybody. everybody's going to stab you in the back and let you down. don't trust anybody. they believe that's the truth. That's how they need to approach adult life and relationships. Or I'm constantly being criticized, neglected, abused, abandoned. I'm a failure. I can't do anything. I don't deserve a good life. Others believe my needs don't matter as much as yours. My needs always have to be subservient to yours, subject to yours, because I don't matter as much as you. Or I must be perfect in order to be good enough. Or I must never be angry or upset. Or you must never be angry or upset with me because that proves that I'm not good enough. That proves that I'm not good enough. That proves that I'm not good enough. That proves that I'm bad. Or my greatest asset is my body. Or my greatest asset is my brain. Or my greatest asset is my accomplishments. I don't have inherent value. I must always be accomplishing something in order to have value. People are only going to be interested in a relationship with me because they want to use me. They don't love me with no strings attached. There's always strings attached. There's always space attached. I have a hidden agenda. The only way I'm going to get respected is to be successful in the world's eyes, to have all the externals. I'll never be respected for who I am only for my position, my possessions, my power. If I ever am sad or angry, I'm a bad person. I must never have needs- me.",

Extroverts are the life of parties. if I'm an introvert, then I'm an inferior person. If I'm not funny and a bit crazy out there, then people will think I am boring and not want to be my friend. for a child coming out of complex trauma, they have hundreds of these lies that they believe, but they seem the truth to that child. Those following those lies, don't trust anybody, put your needs below everybody else's, they don't matter. That seemed to be the truth that kept them safe. That got some of their needs met. And when you come 20, 30 years later and you begin to realize what I thought was the truth is actually a lie, that is a shock. But then to let go of that lie that seemed to be the truth that served you what seemed to be quite for years, but now those lies are preventing healthy relationships. Now those lies are causing you to sabotage everything that you've been doing. Every good thing in your life. Now those lies are causing you to hurt the ones you love the most. What you begin to realize is a child formed a strong attachment to those lies. And now in recovery to let go of those lies, to face those lies and let go of them, it is easier said than done. It is a slow, painful process to begin to identify, the lies, number one, then to let go of them. But it is important to do that. And what I want you to realize is when we look at recovery, to me, to really make sense out of this letting go term, it only makes sense when you really understand the complexities of complex trauma. It leads to all of these connections that are unhealthy. It leads to adaptations, that are unhealthy. It leads to lies and beliefs that are unhealthy. And recovery is figuring that out and learning. I got to let go of a whole bunch of unhealthy stuff. let's look at how do we do that. What's involved in letting go. I have to say upfront is be patient with yourself.

But even if you're in that process of letting go, I'm not going to know if it's the thing to do. I don't know anybody that just sits down one day and figures out exactly what they need to let go and let's go of it in one day. It just doesn't work that way. Letting go is a process. It's a process first of figuring out what I need to let go, what part's healthy, what part's unhealthy, and then coming to a point where I'm able to let go. Because sometimes we know something is unhealthy. We know something we need to let go of. We just know we're not in a place where we can let go. And it's going to take time before we get to the place where finally we're just able to let go. We can't force ourself in some cases to let go of something that we have such a strong bond with. let me give you a few things about why this is a slow process, why we have to be patient with it. The first thing is that our limbic brain and the cortex, they let go on different schedules. your cortex can actually figure out academically, see stuff academically, weigh out the pros and cons, see the negative consequences, and say, that should be let go. And it can do that very quickly. It's the limbic brain that causes the problem. Because the limbic brain, the emotional part of the brain, is what developed an emotional attachment to something unhealthy. Because it seemed to work. It has a lot of emotional memories of the good things that came out of that. And it's the limbic brain that takes a long time to get to a point where it's able to let go. a lot of recovery, people just try to get your cortex to say, this is bad for me. And just to make a decision. And your cortex can't let go. And it's a lot of recovery. And it's a lot of recovery.",

    "output": "Why is it that some people become abusive. And it's an important question to ask, and there's two very critical pieces in answering that. number one is that everybody who's an abuser has a lot of shame. That is almost a given in my mind. what happens with shame, which comes out of complex trauma, is when mom or dad abuse me or neglect me or abandon me, the child concludes it's my fault. It's because I'm not good enough. I must be a bad person. your whole sense of identity is shaped to be a negative. What happens with people with that is nobody to live just walking around hating themselves and feeling that. And people come. They compensate or respond to shame in a variety of different ways. But what happens for people with lots of shame is they can compensate by going to I'm better than everybody. And then what happens with that is they go, my needs are more important than everybody else's as. you get the formation of a narcissist. And then there's a fear that they don't want to acknowledge that they're not good enough. They deny. And that is deep down they still believe that you wouldn't want to stay with me if I gave you a choice. That you would probably find somebody better than me. the only way you're going to stay with me is if I control you. you can see in there you have an abuse element developing. Because if you rebel against my control, then I'm going to have to use abuse to try to regain control. And the other piece with shame is shame, though people might not be aware of it or acknowledge it, shame has a huge anger component. You're angry at yourself. You're angry at the world. You're angry at life. And you lash out at people who are the closest to you. that becomes the formation of an abuser. A lot of shame. But you have to look at the flip side. And that is why do certain people stay with abusers or get attracted to abusers. And the answer is they have the same shame. And deep down they respond in a different way. And they go, nobody would ever love me a lot for who I am.",

And I'll meet with them and I'll try to process stuff and help them work it out. But sometimes I come to this conclusion. Both of you want to work on your stuff and I'm convinced both of you are. You just don't have the tools yet to work on the tough parts of intimate relationships. you can stay together but if you don't have the tools you're going to continue to create more baggage and do more damage. it's not that you don't want it to work. It's not that you're not wanting to change and have a healthy relationship. It's just that where you're both at now in your growth you're incapable of that. And that's not a judgment on you that should cause you shame. It's just the reality of where you are in your own journey. And I say separate. Work on your stuff. Maybe you're going to revisit it down the road. But if you stay together you're only going to make things worse. Next one. What many people do in recovery is they lose sight of the big picture and it goes this. If you come from complex trauma there's a good chance the person you end up with will also have some complex trauma. for this relationship now to work you got a couple of things.",

You got a ton of issues that can get triggered. And you need to be aware of that. Next thing. Let's say you were in a relationship and you did draw a line in the sand and you ended it. Then the other person came to you and they said I'm sorry and it looks they're working on themselves and it'll be different this time lots of promises they are going to meetings etc. you let them back in. And then they mess up again. And you kick them out again. And then a few months later they come back begging and convinced that they're changed and everything's going to be different this time and you let them back in. And that happens a few times. Now. Let's say they really have changed the tenth time. But. You let them in are you convinced they've changed. You're going huh this could be the other times. And what is happening with them from the past is I just got to manipulate this partner of mine and they'll let me back. if you let them back even though they're really wanting to change you're letting them think again that maybe their manipulation worked. And what I have seen happen is if somebody's manipulated their way back a number of times the chances of that relationship ever working are very small. Because you'll never be able to be convinced they've truly changed and they will still think their manipulation will work. And I say often to people you just have to separate. Because you'll never be able to sort it out if you get back together. those are hard realities. that leads to the next question. How do I know if the person is really changing.

And in your mind you're going oh there was a red line and an orange line. And a blue line and a green line. There was many colors. That's not what it means. What it means was it was a coat that said two things. Number one it said you don't have to work. it was a coat where the sleeves went down to the wrists. in that culture when you worked you pushed your sleeves up your arms were free. But if you got a coat that you didn't have to work. he was spoiled in the fact that everybody else had to go to work. He didn't. And then it meant you're going to get the inheritance. all the older brothers and he had ten older brothers they're not getting the inheritance you are. can you imagine how the ten older brothers felt about little Joseph. And then to make things worse Joseph has this dream. And he comes out and he wants to announce it at breakfast to all his brothers and his dad. And he says I had a dream and I became the most important person in the world and you bow down to me. Now they're going this has gone to his head. This guy's got an ego problem. He's got a head the size of a barn. He is out of control. Instead of Joseph seeing their reaction he has a second dream and he announces it at breakfast and says same dream just a little different but I'm still the greatest person and you're all bowing down to me. what happens we're told is that those brothers hated him and in the it says they hated him and then it repeats it how much they hated him. They hated him with great hatred. All of those things you get the idea. They couldn't stand him. And they became very abusive to him. They verbally abused him. Always putting him down.",

Joseph goes off to check on his brothers and they see him coming with his fancy sheep. And they go here is our chance to get rid of this jerk. And they basically decide they're going to kill him.

    "output": "Why is it that in the West especially, but in many countries, narcissists are welcomed as leaders. Why is it that people don't see kind of how destructive they can be and just welcome them with open arms as their savior. And I want to talk about narcissism and leadership this week and next. before I dig into that, I want to just say a couple things up front that I hope would just kind of lay the foundation of really understanding this topic. Eleanor Greenberg has written, nobody is a borderline. Nobody is a narcissist. Nobody is a schizoid. what she is saying is often in our culture today, oh, they're a narcissist. And it's a stigmatized name that we pigeonhole. And she goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, nobody's a narcissist. Nobody's born a narcissist. We might diagnose somebody as narcissistic personality disorder, but what does that mean. And what she says is this. When we diagnose, we're describing a pattern, a particular gestalt, never a person. All people are unique. Labels, however intended, cannot do justice to human complexity. And I want to talk about that. And I want to talk about that. And I would agree with her. what we're really wanting people to understand is people aren't born a narcissist. It's dangerous to just put pigeonhole people and brand them as narcissists. We need to understand that narcissism is a pattern of behavior that has developed in order to protect a deep wound. And it's the outworking of trauma and shame. And the person develops this way of culture. This way of coping, this way of trying to get their needs met, this way of trying to compensate for their shame. But it's patterns of behavior that if you just focus on them, you miss the real issue, which is the deep wound, the deep shame that drives all of that. just to develop that, let me just take you back to the original story that led to the term narcissism. And it comes out of Greek mythology. The myth of narcissists. And a narcissist is a young man that finds himself thirsty one day. And he goes to a pool. And as he bends down to get a drink, the pool is perfectly calm. And he sees his reflection in the pool. And the image is striking.",

And he waits till the water comes down, calms down again. And then he sees his beauty again. And he reaches in to embrace it and then disrupts the water. And what begins to happen is he's desperate to see himself, but he can't embrace it. he just is immobilized. He sits there and just stares at it as reflection all day. And as a result of that, he's not satisfied. He's not satisfied. He's not meeting any of his other needs. He's neglecting his basic needs because he spends all day staring at himself, absorbed in his own beauty. And what has come out of that is really defining narcissism as a person who's totally in love with himself, preoccupied with their own beauty, their own image, how they look. And they need the reflection. They need mirrors or they're called echoes. They need mirrors or they're called echoes to reflect back to them. That's people in their life who tell them how wonderful they are, how much they appreciate them, who validate them constantly. They need that. That's the pattern that develops. get people in your life who will reflect back to your greatness because you need that constant mirrored back to you that you're wonderful, that you're admired. that's basically narcissism. it's all about image. It's all about being admired. It's all about being admired. It's all about power, prestige, control. But if we stop there and then we just brand people, they're a narcissist. We miss what's really going on underneath. What is driving this. let me just read you a couple of quotes and then kind of expand and explain it. Terence Real has said this. People often think of narcissism as the symbol of excessive self-regard. But in fact, he exemplifies the opposite. As the Renaissance. Philosopher Marsilio Ficino observed in the 1500s, narcissists did not suffer from an overabundance of self-love, but rather from its deficiency. The myth is a parable about paralysis. The youth who first appears in restless motion is suddenly rooted to one spot, unable to leave the elusive spirit. He would let no one touch his heart. This is the wound of shame.",

    "output": "One who is deep shame cannot connect and cannot become vulnerable. He is immovable and untouchable. what they're recognizing up front is that narcissism, the person is not able to love themself. That's shame. And therefore, because of that, they're not able to be vulnerable to others. They're not able to connect with others because they can't be authentic. And they become this frozen person seeking. To somehow meet their needs, but never able to connect with others. Ficino goes on to say this. If narcissists had possessed real self-love, he would have been able to leave his fascination. The curse of narcissists is immobilization, not out of love for himself, but out of dependency upon his image. Narcissist is trapped in a vicious narcissistic feedback. He's immobilized from ever growing, from ever really getting his needs met by being captivated or in this feedback loop where he needs others to try to feed his soul. Others to try to meet his needs, others to admire him. And it causes him to be immobilized. He stops growing. The name narcissist comes from the Greek narc, which means numbness. we get narcotics. It. It's a kind of a. Stupor. It is the sting of addiction that narcissists experiences. Healthy self-love would have motivated him to befriend every wounded and weary part of himself. It would have motivated him to tend to his trauma and his deep wounds in his soul. But self-contempt motivated him to search in vain for what he thought he needed to live, only to die from a neglect of what he really needed. In other words, the narcissist is deeply wounded, but he thinks he finds a solution that's going to fix him. But he comes addicted to the solution. It seems to work, but it doesn't. It operates addiction, but he keeps chasing it, looking for the next high of making himself feel better for a moment. But he's not meeting his real needs. He's neglecting what he really needs, the real solution. But he's developing a pattern. And that pattern then gets branded as narcissism. narcissism is not fundamentally about self-love, but about an escape from love. The fragile little boy goes into hiding and the protective false self takes the lead. let me read what John Bradshaw writes. And John Bradshaw has written extensively about shame issues.

I don't want to face myself I can't be exposed to myself. I'm hiding from myself. that's at the heart of neurotic shame, the escape from the self becomes self. necessary. it's all about escaping who I think I am. The escape from self is accomplished by creating a false self. The false self is always more or less than human. the false self may be a perfectionist, superhuman, or a slob, less than human. A family hero, superhuman, or a family scapegoat don't care about anything anybody. As the false self is formed, the authentic self goes into hiding. Years later, the layers of defense and pretense are intense that one loses all conscious awareness of who one really is. But the false self isn't an adult. It's a child stuck in adolescence, perpetually replaying outdated ways of getting its needs met in its present adult body. narcissists, it looks and looks only to become more isolated, more turned in on itself.

    "output": "I want to do one final thing on this series on anger. And I want to focus on what I would consider to be probably the worst type of abuse possible. And it's called gaslighting. And you may have heard of it. You may wonder what in the world is gaslighting all about. It is based on a 1944 movie that was adapted from a 1938 play called Gaslight. Angela Lansbury plays in it. Kim and I watched it. And basically it's about a husband that begins to do things to slowly make his wife think she's going crazy. And that has become the term gaslighting. how I'm going to use it tonight is in light of that. But let me just give you a couple things to help you understand gaslighting. Gaslighting, I said, is what I would consider the most severe type of abuse. It's not physical abuse. It goes beyond verbal abuse, emotional abuse. It's really a psychological warfare where it wears a person down, their self-worth down, that they begin. They begin to doubt everything about themselves. They doubt their thinking. They doubt their perception of reality. And they begin to trust their partner to tell them what reality is, to tell them about their own value, they give more and more power to their partner to control them. And their partner's goal is to bring them to a place a whipped animal where they have no control over their own life. They have no will of their own. And they are just this scared creature who responds to this cruel master. It is carried out by people who would be in a narcissist classification. they are all about themselves. They just get pleasure out of using and abusing people. And when they're with somebody for any length of time, they quickly lose control. They lose respect for that person. And then they begin to try and tear that person down, to slowly dismantle their self-worth, their self-trust, until they are really in their own eyes at nothing. And then the narcissist has total power, total control, but there is a destroyed life in the process. I am going to go through gaslighting in a way that I hope will help you understand it. If you've experienced it, you will quickly understand what I'm talking about.",

Then you start lying to your partner to avoid his put downs. if he said, what did you go to the store for. And you say, I went to get milk. All of a sudden you're afraid that he's going to criticize that. you lie about where you went. that is now taking lying to a new level in the relationship because you're constantly in fear of being judged by them. And that is a very dangerous place. you're constantly trying to avoid all of these criticisms that he's going to give you. Then though, when you're with your friends, they probably saw a long time ago that he was a narcissist and that he was not treating you. And they might even have seen some of the gas lighting.

But then even greater than that, in the even more severe cases, they're not going to be happy until they've made somebody a zero. And that's how they try to solve their shame. they have the exact same shame issues, trauma issues, as the people that they are gaslighting. they, at some point, have to come and face their own stuff if they ever want to get better. It's possible for them to do that, but it is not easy. let's move to the part.

Somebody has said this, when you make a commitment, you build hope. When you keep that commitment, you build trust. And that's just a very wonderful way to say it. Now, what I have realized over the years is that for many people who grew up in complex trauma, commitment to them means something very different than somebody else who grew up in complex trauma. And it really depends on their experience. And I think that's a really important thing to be able to do. they don't necessarily have a true understanding or picture of commitment and trust. It's very much shaped by their complex trauma experience. just for an example, you might have grown up in a family where your physical needs weren't met very or your emotional needs. for you, commitment means a parent who meets your needs. And that's how you define commitment. And it's very limited. And you're not going to be able to do that. at that point in your life, you're not going to be able to accept what your parents would do to you. Or it depends on how your parents would help you fill your misunderstanding or your understanding to just the meeting of needs. Or you grew up in a place where you didn't feel safe.

They just know I need some self-care but they don't know what's caused them to become depleted. there's a lack of awareness about what the people are doing. They don't know what's going on. They don't know what they're doing. And what people then do is, oh I'm tired I just need to rest physically. And that might not be exactly what they need. They might need a self-care that goes beyond just physical rest. And I really want to dig into this because what I find is for a lot of people they see some of the current teaching that might kind of just be that more superficial you just need to go have a day at the spa. And they just think that's going to fix all their problems. And they don't have a full enough understanding of what true self-care is. And they don't understand at a conscious level all the things that bring about us feeling depleted. And I want to really dig into both of those today. I think for anybody in recovery they know that when they're depleted, of energy, it's a dangerous time for them. if they're depleted physically, they're exhausted, or they're depleted emotionally, or they're depleted in their relational gas tanks, that's a dangerous time for a person in recovery. And it's important to begin to understand when we're depleted and what's caused that depletion. We need a growing self-awareness in this area if we're going to do in recovery. That's what we're going to really dig into. What happens I think for many people in recovery which complicates this is they go into recovery after years of basically dissociating.",

Not being able to turn your brain off when you have a resentment or there's been an injustice or you are worried about something or involved in a new cause or you have an embarrassment that you just keep replaying in your mind or a new love in your life that you just become obsessed about and you go over and over and over in your mind. That can be very draining. And it's people that don't have good intellectual internal boundaries that can stop thinking about things when it's time to stop thinking about them. There's a fourth area where depletion happens and that's relationship stuff. let me give you those. if you're involved in a relationship and there's been a series of choices that have now involved in conflict, you're going to be depleted after all of that. If you're coming out of a shame place where you're always trying to impress others, what are they thinking about me. And now you're wearing masks, you're switching and becoming what they want to be. That takes a lot of energy. If you're always telling lies, and got to keep track of what lies you've been telling people, that takes a lot of energy. If you're always fawning and people-pleasing and giving what they want, that takes a lot of energy. If you're constantly needing to be attuned to what everybody's feeling that you can respond, that takes a lot of energy. And what they have found is people in relationships who are basically fawning takes a lot of energy. If you are in a relationship and you have a child or a partner that's behaving badly, let's say you're out in public and your child's crying and having a tantrum, or you're with friends and your partner's being inappropriate, and you're trying to keep a smile on your face and act it's not bothering you, you're suppressing all of that anger, embarrassment, that's a significant amount of energy. And you're trying to keep a smile on your face, and act it's not bothering you, and that's a significant amount of energy being used to suppress all of that.",

That's shame saying you shouldn't be happy. Because you're a screw up. You should be down on yourself. If things are going , you'll sabotage the good stuff in your life and make it all fall apart. That's punishing yourself. Or if things are going , you can start flirting with risky people and risky behavior. You're not fully sabotaging, but you're playing with sabotaging. And if something bad happens, oh. And away you go. That can be a thing. Negative thought loops that play in your head. All the time putting yourself down, telling yourself you're useless, a failure, never amount to anything, nobody will want you. All of that.

When you get to a psychopath or a social path, they've got the most shame of anybody in the world. But they are totally shut down about that. the greater the shame, the greater the mental health problems. And that's because the brain has to do greater and greater things that are bizarre to try and survive with that much shame. And then the final result, and this is important to understand, is do you realize the more shame you have, the more people can manipulate you. Do you realize that your mom might be able to manipulate you to do whatever you want, she wants you to do, but if you had zero shame, your mom couldn't manipulate you at all. If you had zero shame, your mom couldn't manipulate you at all. It's your shame that makes you vulnerable to being manipulated. just think about that.

In this part of our night, what I've been doing is trying to go to stories that speak to the shame issue.

And what many people deep down believe is they know academically that loves them, but deep down they're not convinced He really wants them. there's an emotional resistance. There might be an intellectual acceptance, but there's something that just has trouble believing that would love somebody me. I've been looking or presenting stories that speak to that fear, that distorted belief, which is really a lie, that will help us with that. And tonight I want to tell you the story of a lady named Rahab. Rahab was the first real prostitute that we meet in the. And I want to say this up front just to kind of help you understand where I'm coming from. I've dealt with hundreds and hundreds of women and men who've sold their bodies, often just to get drugs, often because they were forced to and pimped out, or they were taken and trafficked, all of those things. But what I have found in dealing with pretty everybody that I know that has been in selling their body is there is a trauma element in their childhood. And part of what they have done in their way of coping has led them down a trail that has resulted in the sale of their body for sex.",

And that was part of her journey, and what that means is there was an element of shame. The second thing that I want you to think about, and I say this very carefully, but when people are involved in the sale, the sale of their body, there has to be something that shuts off in order to endure the added shame they feel for what they lower themselves to do. And some of them are in total denial of that layer of shame, but when you get to know them and they feel safe, and they become more self-aware, they begin to be able to talk about the shame that grew during their time of being involved in prostitution. shame is a common and a deep issue with those who have been involved in prostitution. One of the things that's interesting about Rahab, if the story, Rahab lived in Jericho. when Israel came out of Egypt, out of slavery, they went across the wilderness, they got to the edge and they said, we can't go in, made them wander around in the wilderness for 40 years until that generation died out. The next generation under Joshua comes again to the edge of the promised land, to the Jordan River, and they go across. The first city that they come to is Jericho. Jericho was the first place they entered in this new land of promise. It was a fortified city. It was a city that was prepared for war. It was a city that we're told the walls were thick that they could drive chariots around on the top of the walls. that's how fortified it was. What we know about Rahab is she had a house in the walls. another way to say that is only the very wealthy could afford houses in the walls. Other people lived inside the walls, in their homes, shacks, whatever, but the -to-do had houses in the walls. Rahab was -to-do. I don't know if you remember this story, but her signal that she was a prostitute was she hung a red cord out of her window.",

Again, planting seeds of doubt. it's a very gradual process. the 16 signs, that you can then ask yourself, that are indicators that you are being gaslit. you can check these off. Number one, is that you are in a conversation with your partner, and every time there's conflict or a disagreement, you feel pulled by them to blame yourself for the problems that you're having in the relationship. In other words, they always make it your fault. They never accept responsibility, but twist everything and make it your fault. whatever you say, they distort it, and they make it your fault. you begin to think maybe they're. Because I always seem to be messing up. And they can give very convincing arguments why you're wrong and they're , and it's all your fault. you get that constantly pulled into accepting blame for everything. Secondly, you begin to second guess yourself. you're in situations, and you all of a sudden go, maybe I'm not seeing this accurately. Now let me just stop here and say this. Part of complex trauma, is that you're going to have times where you legitimately question your perception, because it's distorted because you're angry. Or you're in fear. that's healthy questioning your perception. What's happening in gaslighting, is even when you're not in an emotionally escalated state, you start to question your perception. The times that you normally in the past would have been accurate in your perception, you now question and doubt yourself. you are having less confidence in yourself. Thirdly, you begin to conclude that maybe they're and I am too sensitive. Maybe they are , and I make too big a deal out of things. I just need to get over stuff. I let too much stuff bother me. Again, complex trauma, often we do overreact. Gaslighting, they make you question everything as an overreaction.

In a family of complex trauma, a dysfunctional family, there's the one child that's referred to as the troublemaker. They're the ones that. That's defiant, rebellious, angry all the time. And he just won't get with the program and smarten up. Now let me say this up front. Of all the roles that we're going to look at, the problem child is the one person in the family that is being honest. Everybody else is lying, both to each other and to. To themselves. What is going on in the scapegoat or the problem child is they're saying this. This family is sick. And I'm not going to lie about that. We're messed up.

I rebel against what's happening here. Now that's how it starts. A good rebellion. The problem is it goes into a bad. Rebellion as. But that's what it begins. Now, that's what's going on in the child. Now, here's why the parents the scapegoat. Now, when people say, you seem to have trouble in your family. They go, look at our hero child. We're good parents. The reason we're having trouble is because of this child. He's the problem. And that's why he's called the scapegoat. He is blamed for all the problems in the family, in the marriage. And what the parents basically communicate is this. If we didn't have this child, we wouldn't have any problems in our family.

And they just have a great deal of time, hard time trusting, much you. Then they're extremely stubborn. And complex trauma creates a stubbornness. And if you have a stubborn personality and add complex trauma, you are super stubborn. And nobody being around you when you're in the stubborn zone. Because you can't be reasoned with. That's the way a sheep is. And then sheep live by a mob instinct. if one sheep claims to be the leader, and they start running over a cliff, all the sheep will follow them.

How does it affect a person. When I started back over 16 years ago, the lady that trained me said, Tim, the problem isn't the addiction. It's why they are addicted. What problems were they trying to solve by their addiction. And that is what has led to the understanding that addiction, for 97 of the people, is trying to solve the issues from childhood. The pain that they have, and that's what we call complex trauma. Complex trauma is not just one-time event trauma, though it can include that, but it's. trauma that goes on over a period of time, or when a person feels unsafe over a period of time, that they live in fight-flight-freeze mode, survival mode, constantly. In one-time event trauma, you go into survival mode, get safe, come back out of it. And that's a great system. Complex trauma is you're always in survival mode, and it begins to change you. It starts to change you in negative ways. that's the basic definition of complex trauma. Somebody's put together a list of types of complex trauma that a child could go through. bullying we talk about all the time, but it could be a child that grows up where there's just a lot of violence in their community. there's people getting jacked all the time, there's violence and abuse and murder and all of those things happening. And their community, walking the streets is not a safe place for them. they're always on guard, on alert. Then there's the effect of natural disasters and people that live in earthquakes and tornadoes and hurricanes and all of those things. And if you're in a disaster area, it keeps you on guard. We are now experiencing the effects of ongoing terrorism activity.

They get punished, they get hurt, they get teased, if they try to do those things. And away, the child is being told that to be healthy is bad, because it will result in pain. you must adapt in order to survive. And the things that you do in order to survive, the adaptations, they keep you safe in the moment, but over time they make you very unhealthy. And they prevent healthy relationships.

What happens in complex trauma is they are not allowed to be fully human. And their adaptations to survive really are becoming less human. More and more they shut down their humanness, their emotions, their trying to connect. And adaptations that come out of complex trauma make people less and less human. And that is the tragedy of complex trauma. Now let me give it to you from a different perspective, but they're overlapping. I think it's important in understanding complex trauma to understand that complex trauma equals unresolved, unmet needs.",

    "output": "we're in a series on codependency and what we've been looking at is that codependency really is an overused term and I don't, it's got much baggage anymore that one of the reasons I wanted to teach about it was to just clear up some of that baggage but also to show that I don't think you can understand codependency properly unless you understand complex trauma. Because codependency to me is one of the symptoms that comes out of complex trauma. And last week we looked at that in the extreme case, complex trauma leads to deep shame which leads to extreme responses to that shame and the most severe response as far as overcompensating is a narcissist who thinks they're better than everybody. But in order for a narcissist to be in a relationship, we showed that there has to be a co-narcissist and they tend to be at the other end of the shame as far as how they respond. Same amount of shame, just totally different response, hate themselves, very low self-esteem. They find each other and they create a relationship and that's what we talked about last week. Tonight I want to go into the patterns that happen in codependent relationships. I'm going to talk a bit more about the extreme with the narcissist, the co-narcissist. But the point that I want you to understand about codependency was it's two people with shame issues trying to solve their shame problems. And what they do is they try to be there and fix the other person that other person will then love them and meet their needs and help fix their shame. both people are trying to fix their shame. And what I want you to do is I want you to fix the other person in order to try to get their own needs met and to solve their own shame problems and to get the love and respect they've always wanted. we in the first talk said that codependent relationships are what are called the dance of wounded souls. it's two wounded people dancing, trying to figure out how to get their needs met, how to manipulate the other person. And in order for that to work, you need a helper and you need somebody who's needy. Or you need a narcissist or a co-narcissist.",

They tend to be attracted to, four different types of people that all have something in common. the first is they are attracted to wanting a relationship with somebody who's really impressive. the president of a company, the millionaire, whatever. now that they're connected to and they can kind of draw from that person's greatness and it reflects on themselves. The second one is somebody that is just full of praise and admiration. And the second one is somebody that is just full of love and admiration. And you have to be a little bit more than that. And if you have that love, you have to be a little bit more than that. If you have that love, you have to be a little bit more than that.

I'm going to do this. and admiration, and compliments, and they're constantly feeding the narcissist the stuff that they need to make them feel good. And then the trophy, somebody they can put on their arm that makes them look really good because they're beautiful, because they're just such a wonderful person. They're looking for that person. And then the fourth is somebody who will put up with their crap and not leave them. And they will, once their true colors come out, not get rid of them, but hang in there with them. narcissist, the helper person, looks for people that. The co-narcissist or the needy person, they're attracted to somebody who's full of charm and confidence, and they come across as appearing very strong and very full of self-worth and bold, all of those things that make this personality look , wow, this guy's got it together.

Where disrespect now begins to enter the relationship. Little shots. Little lashing out. And there's increased bouts of anger that begin to happen. Verbal abuse, emotional abuse. And that can build into physical abuse, financial abuse, sexual abuse. the devaluing stage is they are now blaming you for why they're discontent. And they are lashing out at you. Now they might not do this initially to your face. But they might. They might do it to their friends and say, you should see the biatch I got at home and all of this stuff. And they call you all kinds of nasty things behind your back. But that will begin to come into the relationship. And there'll be pot shots and all kinds of different things that. That will begin to take place. then what you find yourself doing is walking on eggshells. Because they're irritable now. that little thing. that little thing set them off. And they lash out. you're now on eggshells. But what can also happen is both are becoming increasingly discontent with the other. And for the narcissist, their narcissism isn't getting fed now. Because you're not responding. they can cheat. They go looking for somebody else to feed their narcissism. And then that means they have to start lying to you. And then as it progresses. this is a progression. I want you to get that. This doesn't happen all at once. This is a gradual thing. But they begin to tell you less and less. And they begin to become a parasite. they just basically look to mooch off of you. You're there as their meal ticket to pay their bills, to feed them, to take care of them.

You are the devil in disguise, and they are quite happy to talk about it. Then to your face, they project everything. you are confronting them and saying, why are you treating me this. Why are you cheating. What's wrong with me. And they, at first, might not answer you. They give you the silent treatment. But then they might say, you want to know. It's because you're this way, you're this way, you're this way. And they project all of the problems onto you. It's all your fault. And they accuse you of stuff you've never even known.

And they are going to chase. Now what they're counting on is a couple of things. Number one, once you've said no, if you've not dealt with your own shame, after a couple of weeks, you're going to start to miss them. And you're going to feel lonely. And you're going to feel all your shame issues coming up. And then what's going to happen. Your mind's going to go back to, not to the discard stage, not to the devalue stage, but to the fantasy idealized stage. And you're going to say, oh, they were loving. They had such a good heart. There was a beautiful person in there. If somebody would just love them enough, it would come out. And then you start missing them. And guess what. They show up with a text saying, how are you doing.

Hastily having they own you, mirroring, being super nice, charming, bringing flowers, sending the most beautiful texts in the world, all kinds of things. Now what happens at this stage is what we call dosing. They don't go fully back to the idealized stage.

I hope it doesn't get as focused this week, but I have felt the need to include in this anger series this topic of abuse because many of you have experienced it, and my concern is a lot who have experienced it haven't yet processed it, they've grown from it. They're still kind of stuck, afraid to go back and look at this very painful part of their life. I want to begin tonight by just asking a very simple question. Why is it that some people become abusive. And it's an important question to ask, and there's two very critical pieces in answering that. number one is that everybody who's an abuser has a lot of shame. That is almost a given in my mind. what happens with shame, which comes out of complex trauma, is when mom or dad abuse me or neglect me or abandon me, the child concludes it's my fault. It's because I'm not good enough. I must be a bad person. your whole sense of identity is shaped to be a negative. What happens with people with that is nobody to live just walking around hating themselves and feeling that. And people compensate or respond to shame in a variety of different ways. After this anger series, we're going to do a whole series on shame to really develop that and explore that. And just to give you a heads up, it'll be heavy, but I hope a very healing series for you. But what happens with that is that people compensate by going to I'm better than everybody. And then what happens with that is they go, my needs are more important than everybody else's as. you get the formation of a narcissist. And then there's a fear that they don't want to acknowledge that they deny. And that is deep down, they still believe that you wouldn't want to stay with me if I gave you a choice. That you would probably find somebody better than me. the only way you're going to stay with me is if I control you. you can see in there, you have an abuse element developing. Because if you rebel against my control, then I'm going to have to use abuse to try to regain control.",

    "output": "And the other piece with shame is shame, though people might not be aware of it or acknowledge it. Shame has a lot of impact on you. And that's why I'm going to talk about shame. Shame has a huge anger component. You're angry at yourself, you're angry at the world, you're angry at life, and you lash out at people who are the closest to you. that becomes the formation of an abuser. A lot of shame. But you have to look at the flip side. And that is why do certain people stay with abusers or get attracted to abusers. And the answer is, they have the same shame. And deep down, they respond in a different way. And they go, nobody would ever love me a lot for who I am. I have to become content with getting a few crumbs of love once in a while. That's probably the best that I can do. if I'm in a relationship where I'm abused, but I get love once in a while, I'll just have to put up with that and accept that because that's the best I'm going to get. you get the two sides of shame that get attracted to each other and end up in a relationship. And both are necessary to keep the relationship going. Do you realize if the person who takes the abuse and says, I'm content with a few crumbs, they could have left many, many times, but they stay there. And the question is why. And it's the shame thing. Only the flip side of it. The flip side of the response to shame. The next thing goes this. I work with addicts every day. And the question I often want them to consider is, if you look inside of yourself, you are a whole bunch of desires and hormones and chemicals and needs. And those needs and desires and drives are all in competition with each other. you got a desire for something. You got a desire for food, for sex, for relationships, for position, for power, all in competition. In a healthy person, there's one drive, one need that trumps everything else, and that is love. I will have a sex drive, but never to the point where it violates love. Love will trump that. What happens in an abuser is things begin to change. They trump love.",

We don't need those other things. And you hearing that, and you get sucked into that. that has a bigger thing of control. You'll see them more and more, wanting to control everything in your life. Your activities, your time, who you see, when you see them. Control begins to take over. They want to check your phone, check your Facebook. All of that control just keeps going up and up. Then you'll see jealousy going up and up. at first they won't reveal jealousy, but jealousy becomes the beginning of the mask starting to slip. Because that will show how angry they can become, how controlling they can become, and that begins to happen. Then disrespect comes. Disrespect will start to happen. at first in the salesman role, they sound they respect you more than anything else in the world. But once the jealousy and control starts to build, they start taking shots at you. Put downs. Things that make you feel stupid. Things that make you feel a burden. That you're lucky that they're patient with you. And then that can begin to go into public, public things that they say around other people where they put you down in front of your friends or your family. that begins to happen. Manipulation, emotional abuse. they turn often into little wee boys and girls who pout, have temper tantrums, give you the silent treatment, withhold affection from you. All part of a manipulation game. Next characteristic. They don't respect your boundaries. They want you to respect their boundaries, but they think they can do whatever they want as far as your time, your phone, showing up, taking all your time. Your no doesn't mean no to them. Lack of respect for boundaries. They will get more and more critical. again, let me say, you're not going to see this till you endure or get past the salesman stage.

And a lot of people come along and go, I don't think I have trauma because I haven't had any of that big T trauma. But yet they've got lots of very subtle trauma. Unless they become aware of it, they're not able to really start healing and growing and working on themselves the way they could or should. And I spend a lot of time just helping people understand some of the more subtle forms of complex trauma. we've talked about kind of the big three, which is abuse, neglect, and abandonment. And then we've talked about betrayal trauma, cultural trauma, political trauma, and abuse. And then we've talked about trauma, cultural trauma, political trauma, trauma, and abuse. And then we've talked about trauma, cultural trauma, and abuse. And then we've talked about trauma, cultural trauma, political trauma, captivity trauma, collective trauma, generational trauma, all of those we've tried to explain and develop. What I want to do today and next time is look at some of the even more subtle forms of trauma. And you may have experienced them, you may not. I don't know that. But if you have, I think these talks could really turn some light bulbs on for you and really help you go, oh, that makes sense as to where my trauma comes from. Now, having said that, I just need to give up front kind of a trigger warning. This talk might really bring up a lot of painful stuff for some of you. It might be very overwhelming once the pieces start falling into place. And just be aware of that. Make sure you have people you can talk to. the very first one I want to focus on is what I call the unwanted baby. for some of you, you definitely relate to this. let me give you three causes of an unwanted baby. number one, your parents might have got pregnant by accident. And when we talk about accidental pregnancies, there's really two types. the one is a mistimed pregnancy. they kind of want to get pregnant. Just not now.",

    "output": "if the mother's wanting this child is excited about this child and oxytocin is released that's going to have a very positive effect on attachment once the child is born. But then on the negative a 2020 study noted that growing babies can be impacted by mood changes trauma and complications during pregnancy. many factors have the potential to interrupt bonding with a child in utero including anticipatory anxiety the mother's nervous about the baby coming or doesn't want the baby coming financial distress just a lot of stress in the person's life the mother's stressed out that affects the child hormonal changes substance use unplanned or unwanted pregnancy and partner abandonment divorce separation or death of a partner. All of those creates a very negative emotional world and a very negative emotional world. Stressful world for the mother which affects the baby in utero. what are the results then beyond just in the uterus. again the Drexel University College of Women has said here's what you can expect is going to happen to a child that was not wanted. when they are finally born there's not going to be the attachment with the parents that would have happened if they were deeply wanted. If the parents immediately wanted to connect there's going to interrupt secure attachment then that's going to usually result in either neglect because the parents just aren't madly in love with this child they're going to be some neglect happening or some abuse. The parents get frustrated easily with the child that the parents lash out at the child. The parents get angry a lot at the child. The parents blame the child for their problems because that child wasn't wanted. And there's going to be neglect abuse or abuse.",

    "output": "Narcissists can act very healthy until they're triggered. And it's those triggers that reveal their true colors. They can no longer hide their deeper stuff once they get triggered. The masks come away and they come out. some of the main triggers for a narcissist are perceived rejection. if you reject them or say no to them, watch out. Not getting what they want, not getting enough attention. You're not feeding me enough or anything that messes with their image. what happens if they don't get what they want or they get triggered. Usually they go to anger and then they get cruel, abusive. They lash out. They say extremely. Hurtful things. And they can be very destructive. Just that one trigger can set off a whole lot of painful things. And they can do that and not even have a conscience about it. you often don't know a person's a narcissist until one of their triggers get triggered. And then their true colors will come out. Narcissists are all about manipulating. You to meet their needs. Narcissists don't know how to love people. They just know how to use people now in their minds. They're being loving because they're giving their kind in the early days. But what they're really doing is grooming you. They're giving to get. They're playing a long game where I'll give, give, give, give till I've got there past their defenses and their guards. And they trust me and then I'll get. that is the manipulation that happens inside of a narcissist. Now to help you understand that. When a person has a lot of shame deep down that they've never acknowledged, they're pretty sure that if people get to know them, nobody will ever want to meet their needs. the only way they can get their needs met is not to express them, but to learn how to manipulate people to meet them. And from, they can access and give into them. Narcissists become master manipulators. They can get good at manipulating, Sometimes you're not even aware that they're manipulating you. Usually there's always a hidden agenda that's happening when you're working with a narcissist. And when you first meet a narcissist and they say, tell you about, tell me about yourself. And you pour out your heart until you tell them everything about yourself gives her the upper hand.",

They got to get that back in balance in their mind. they got to put you back into the inferior position and reestablish that. what begins to happen in a relationship after you get through that fantasy stage and there's a discontent that begins to develop is a devaluing stage where disrespect now begins to enter the relationship. Little shots, little lashing out. And there's increased bouts of anger that begin to happen, verbal abuse, emotional abuse, and that can build into physical abuse, financial abuse, sexual abuse. the devaluing stage is. They are now blaming you for why they're discontent. And they are lashing out at you. Now they might not do this initially to your face. They might do it to their friends and they call you all kinds of nasty things behind your back. But that will begin to come into the relationship.

And for the narcissist, their narcissism isn't getting fed now because you're not responding they can cheat. They go looking for somebody else to feed their narcissism. They go looking for somebody else to feed their narcissism. They go looking for somebody else to feed their narcissism. And then that means they have to start lying to you. And then as it progresses. this is a progression. I want you to get that. This doesn't happen all at once. This is a gradual thing. But they begin to tell you less and less.

Then to your face, they project everything. you are confronting them and saying, why are you treating me this. Why are you cheating. What's wrong with me. And they, at first, might not answer you. They give you the silent treatment. But then they might say, you want to know. It's because you're this way, you're this way, you're this way. And they project all of the problems onto you. It's all your fault. They accuse you of stuff you've never even dreamed of doing. And often it's because they're already doing it themselves. But they're accusing you of what they are doing but making it sound you're the one doing it. that's the projection that they do. And then they start this damage control. they put stuff on Facebook about how terrible you are and they put pictures of this new person they're with and everybody's happy. Everybody's happy. And it makes them look the hero again. And they're doing damage control on their image. that's the three parts of the cycle. Now I want to dig into this discard stage a little bit.

I want to come in at two angles. if you are the one that a narcissist discards, and you get a third one, what would you do. they get rid of you. Usually it's very sudden. It's flipping a switch. One day we're done. They say that we're done and they're gone. And usually they move very quickly in with somebody else. It's one relationship to another.

Now what I want you to understand is shame by definition is not an emotion. It is a core belief about yourself, about who you think you are. There will be emotions that go with that we call shame emotions, but at its core by definition, shame is a core belief. And what shame means is I have a negative view of myself. I see myself as not having a lot of value, not being very lovable. Therefore, I see myself as not being good enough and therefore less than others around me. I would say 100. I'm going to say 100 of people with complex trauma have some shame. The greater the complex trauma, the greater the shame. But everybody with complex trauma has some shame. In other words, complex trauma affects your core belief about your identity. What emotions does that then create when they're made to feel not valuable, not lovable, not good enough. , you can imagine there's pain. There's fear. Will anybody want me. Will anybody respect me. And they have a lot of anxiety now as they make friends. A lot of insecurities are now there. Many with shame become depressed because they don't themselves. Life sucks. They hate themselves. They are very hard on themselves. Some begin self harming behaviors because they hate themselves much. They hate themselves. They find out there's a lot of anger in there. They're jealous of anybody that has more attention than them. They're envious of what everybody else has. They get very negative about themselves and everybody else. And they're very discontent. And for some, they get to a place where they feel hopeless. I am a total screw up. I don't see any way out of this. What's the point. what I want you to understand is shame does nothing but produce negative emotions and powerful negative emotions, not mild ones, but powerful ones. And the emotional world of a shame based person is predominantly negative emotions. And that is a difficult thing to live with because what happens with shame is you don't know how to live with it.

I am going to be made to feel ugly and that will feed my shame. But it won't stop there. I'm going to get teased. I'm going to get a new nickname. I'm going to get made fun of. And shame isn't just a package all by itself. Shame also has other emotions or other things that people do to you that hurt. pain doesn't just end or shame doesn't just end with shame. Shame leads to more pain. Nothing good comes out of shame. , I'm going to take you a little bit longer here but I want you to understand how our brain tries to solve shame. in the middle is the real self,. Now if you're told through the mirrors that your real self is no good, that you're less than, that you're not lovable, you develop the gray area outside of that, the other circle, which is the shame. You're the shame-based self and that's the critic. And the critic is now in your brain that's constantly saying, you're not good enough. And it puts yourself down and it's very negative towards yourself. , that's there. But there's still a part of you that says, I want to be loved. I want to be respected. How do I do that. only solution is this. I can't show them my real self because they'll reject me and abandon me mom and dad. Here's another way that we start to see our real self and we start to realize that we do own people. ,. there we go. The ideal self in your mind that if you were this, you would be perfectly happy. Everybody would love you. Everybody would respect you. It's a fantasy, but it's in your thinking. If only I was this, all my problems would be solved. Now, here's the problem.

What's the difference between shame and guilt. Very important question. Guilt is about what you do. Shame is about who you are. Guilt is about actions. Shame is about identity. Guilt is actually a wonderful system. Where we have this thing called a conscience. That if we do something that violates love. We feel pain. if we tell a lie. If we cheat somebody. Cheat on somebody. Steal. Something bugs us. That's guilt. It was designed to be a good system. That was to say. Are you in enough pain yet. To straighten up and change your behavior. To get back to telling the truth. To being honest. guilt is a wonderful system. To correct unloving behavior. And make it loving again. guilt is resolvable. Shame is not resolvable. It is saying you're not good enough. And there's nothing you can do about it. You just have to live with that identity. And the emotions you feel around that identity. shame is the problem area. Because you can't find a way to fix it. Now I got to add false guilt. Because in complex trauma families. Your conscience was often misguided. Or miseducated. dad was saying. You're selfish for wanting to play baseball. And you go. It's wrong to play baseball. Bad me. That's a misguided conscience. But now you feel guilt. Every time you want something. And part of recovery. Is learning true guilt from false guilt. Final thing. Once you have a lot of shame. And then you do something wrong. You get guilt. But what does guilt do now. I did something bad. I am bad. guilt now feeds shame. if you got lots of shame. I don't feel good enough. I'm bad. I'm not lovable. You steal from somebody. You feel guilt. But then you go.

All the old coping things and the consequences of it that are now making life painful today. And today we're coming to a key characteristic that comes out of complex trauma, which is the fear of being a burden or a pain. The fear of being annoying because you have needs. In a healthy home, what happens is the understanding is there that your needs are just as important as my needs. One's not better than the other. We're both equal. And we are going to learn. We're going to learn how to love each other in a way that your needs get met and my needs get met. Sometimes, though, I will have to sacrifice my needs in order to meet your needs. And sometimes you'll sacrifice your needs to meet mine. But overall, it'll be equal still. There might be times where I have to sacrifice for an extended period of time. And I'm willing to accept that. you would get that with a brand-new chair. you would get that with a brand-new chair. There's no difference between giving back and not giving back. Then you sacrifice. Then you sacrifice. Then you sacrifice. Then you sacrifice. Then you sacrifice. But eventually, they grow up and are able to give back.

Now let me give you just this thing to think about. , for a child in complex trauma, expressing a need and asking for help usually resulted in being told you're selfish. You were humiliated. You were shamed. And part of what was going on there dynamics wise is not just was your need not met, but you went through the emotional pain of humiliation. Here's what I want you to understand. Now, to express a need means you have to humble yourself. And that's scary for a person from complex trauma because I have to be vulnerable. I have to admit I have a need. I have to go to somebody. Humbling myself makes me afraid they're going to humiliate me. But understand this. When you humble yourself and go to your safe person, they will never humiliate you. Your humility will not result in humiliation. But only if you humble yourself. But only if you have safe people. there's two very important pieces here in getting our needs met. Both parties become involved. I need humility, but I need safe people. And when you put the two together, then you get your needs met in a healthy way. And then continue to deal with the shame that came out of feeling a burden. Feeling you weren't good enough. And again, we see over and over again that this shame piece is such a huge part of our healing journey. Continue to work on that. It is all part of the process. , that's the end of part one. We're going to take a short break. Then I'll come back and do a part. If that doesn't interest you, no problem. You're free to go. We'll see you next week. To everybody else, I'll be back in just a minute. Thank you.",

    "output": "Today where I want to go is to the results of trauma. And if you were to go to the average program for being offered to people with trauma, what you would probably get is a program that focused on the physical results of trauma. they would talk about if you become emotionally dysregulated, the startled response, the hypervigilance. And all of those are debilitating things to have to deal with in adult life. They can really mess stuff up. But I would say that's not the most negative consequence of trauma. It's not in the physical stuff. It is in shame. It is in how it shapes our identity. I want to start with what I would consider to be the greatest negative consequence that comes out of trauma. And that is it creates a negative identity. I find it very interesting. We've had other programs, other agencies that have checked out our program, our material, and have basically said to me, we teach basically most of what you teach, all except for the shame piece. And I always think, wow. You've missed the greatest negative consequence. The most far-reaching consequence of trauma. Now, this shame word is a really tricky word because it's a word that's not clearly understood. It's not a word that we talk about much in our culture. It is a word that most people don't understand. And most people, when they hear shame, they think, oh, I don't have shame. When actually, it's a very clear word. When actually, they are probably controlled by shame. They have tons of shame. It is just buried deep or not even recognized because it's not been taught or understood. But it is running their life powerfully in a negative way. And that is why I really want to take tonight to develop and help you understand what is shame. that you get a very clear, picture of it. And then you can begin to understand if you have it in your own life and how it's impacting you. Where most people begin when they think of shame is really the wrong start starting point. They think of shame as an emotion. they go, I feel ashamed. that's what shame is, which is I feel embarrassed or shame on you. That emotion part of shame. let's start with it. Shame, yes, is an emotion.",

But shame is about a core belief about my identity that I'm not going to let go. That I'm not good enough. I'm not valuable. I'm not lovable. I have a negative identity. That is the core understanding of shame. when you take the word, I feel ashamed or shame on you. What is actually happening there is there's blending of two concepts that are similar, that overlap, but are different. And that is shame and guilt. And that's where a lot of people get confused because they think shame equals guilt. let me explain the difference. It's really important to understand it and then how they overlap. Guilt is about what I do, actions wise. Shame is about who I am. guilt is a radar system inside of me that is triggered. Every time I do something that violates love. I tell a lie. I'm unkind to somebody. I'm abusive. I feel guilt. It is saying what you have done is harmful. It is wrong. If you continue doing that, you're going to hurt your relationships. You're going to hurt yourself. You're going to hurt others. guilt is a negative emotion. That is to be a positive motive. A positive motivator to get back to living lovingly. To doing things that are characterized by love. guilt is a negative emotion that is designed to motivate me to resolve it. Which means change my behavior. Shame is about who I am. Shame is basically saying, I do not have value. I am not lovable. I am not good enough. I am less than. what can happen in many complex trauma homes is parents can say, You did something bad you are bad. And they blend and confuse guilt and shame. because you did bad actions, your identity is bad. But the problem with shame, it's this painful emotion but the child can't resolve it. Because if I'm bad, how do I fix that. Because I keep doing some bad things. And now guilt feeds shame. Every time I do something bad, I not only have guilt, I now go, oh that proves I'm bad. And it feeds that negative identity. that's where they overlap.",

That's the way it should be. And then they go into life with that positive identity. But what happens again. What comes when that doesn't happen. You get neglect and abuse. I guess I'm not lovable. I guess I'm not valuable. I guess I'm less than everybody else. And then you have all the self-esteem problems that come out of that. , we're going to go into the heavier part now and go through some of the causes. what are some of these mirrors that send back to a child this distorted message that they interpret as their core identity which is actually a shame identity. , we talked about any type of abuse. The child says, it's my fault. I'm being abused because I must be bad. , physical abuse, verbal abuse, emotional abuse. Then you take a child that's put into children's aid society. Children that go through being adopted. Children that go through a divorce where all of a sudden they're separated and they feel somewhat abandoned. They feel, I guess I'm abandoned. I guess I was put up into children's aid or all of that because I'm not good enough. And if they're adopted, they might end up with wonderful parents. But deep down, there's this haunting question of why did my original parents not want me. Why did they get rid of me. And they can know that the parents didn't have the ability to take care of them. But there's still this original message that says something must have been wrong with me. And , that is a powerful thing. , there's actually new studies coming out to study the effects of divorce that we're seeing rampant in our culture.

Or parents that make promises and break them to the child. In the child's mind it must be because I'm not good enough. That's why my parents keep breaking their promises. Flip side of all of that is you get the spoiled child and you go how could a spoiled child ever end up with shame where they're given gift after gift after gift. They're led away with stuff. They can do whatever they want. Do you want to know what the child wants. Don't try to buy my love. Give me yourself. And if you're not going to give me yourself then I don't feel valuable. Regardless of the gifts you give. And if you cared enough you would set boundaries for me. But the fact you set no boundaries and just let me do whatever I want. Bottom deep down says you don't care. And they get the same message out of that. Conditional love. Parents that give the silent treatment. Parents that withhold love until the child does what they want. That sends the same message. Shame-based parenting. Where if you do something wrong it's not the parents response isn't just to correct it and to love you back. The parents have got to shame you. They got to make you really feel bad. That sends the same message. Or you have parents who are all about their image. their value system is money, things, the house, the car, how they look in public. And what the child is getting, is that matters more than me. Because the parents put more energy into that than the relationship with me. And then other possible causes. It's very interesting to me that studies have been done on children who bed wet. about 10 of children bed wet. Past kind of when they're potty trained. Of those who become addicts and end up with more severe trauma, that bed wetting goes on.",

And the battle begins by getting out of my limbic brain into my cortex and acting based on what I know is true, even though it doesn't feel true. And I treat myself with respect, even though something in me wants to beat myself up and put myself down. I choose to be true. I choose to treat myself with respect. what we often say to clients is, you're acting your way through your cortex to a re-education of your limbic brain to a new way of feeling about yourself.

That is, very difficult, but it is an important part. healing shame isn't feeling better about yourself as the first step. Healing shame is choosing to accept the package, who you are. And that's where it begins. Next, accept your past. Many people look back and it feeds their shame. I am a loser. Look at all the crap that happened to me. Look how nobody wants me. Nobody wanted to be with me. And they just keep feeding off of all of that negative stuff in their past. And what I say to people is, you can't go back and change your past. You can't go back and get new parents. You can't go back and get a different childhood. Accept that and learn from it. And let it guide you to actually growing. And then accept the slow growth process. We all wish there was a magical, pill somewhere that would instantly heal shame. Do you want to know how long it takes to heal shame. The rest of your life. There's no magic pill. It is the slowest healing part of the trauma journey. And when you think of it, it's the first thing that started from infancy. That belief. And it's not going to heal quickly.

Now you can get through it in half an hour. And then as you keep growing, those triggers will become less intense. Because you're quickly going to be able to go, that's their crap, not mine. And it's not going to bother you as much. accept the slow journey. And then learn to forgive yourself and deal with this internal critic. A lot of people find it helpful to see that internal critic as kind of somebody else. And have an argument with it and say, would you shut up. Because you're telling me lies now and I don't have to listen to you. learn to deal with that. here's a big piece of all of this that I want you to see. Many parents use what we call shame-based parenting, which is the way to motivate a child is to tear them down, criticize them. That'll make them want to improve. And that works short term. And studies have shown that. But if you do that as the norm, it eventually, beats the child down they don't want to. what happens to a lot of people when they come into working on themselves, is they still try to shame-based parent themselves. They beat themselves down. Thinking that's going to motivate them to want to change. And they actually feed their guilt, they feed their shame, hoping it's going to motivate them to change. It doesn't. there's over a hundred different tests that have been done to say, what is the one main thing that causes lasting change and a desire to change. People are expecting shame. Guess what it was. Self-compassion. Be kind to yourself. Forgive yourself. Say, hey, I can't go back and redo that. I'm not going to beat myself up, but I'm going to learn and I'm going to change. I'm not saying it was , but the solution is not beating myself up, the solution is changing. learn that self-compassion that is such an important part. And then find accurate mirrors.",

But you need boundaries. what I see all the time is people come into our program and they heal tremendously in their shame. Then they go visit their parents for Thanksgiving or Christmas.

It can be broken in a heartbeat if you're back around the wrong mirrors. you're going to have to look at mirrors or boundaries with unhealthy mirrors. And then connect with healthy people. Shame is healed. Bottom line, what's my goal been. Nobody wants to connect with me, I'm going to hide. I'm going to connect with people.

We're continuing our series on reparenting, which is the process of healing from trauma, that we have to parent ourselves, learn to meet our own needs, learn to regulate our emotions, all kinds of things. And we've been looking at a variety of topics that we need to learn how to reparent ourselves in, because it was quite possible that we weren't parented in a healthy way in those areas as a child. And today we're coming to the big topic of sex. every parent has the responsibility of the birds and bees talks with their children, introducing their children to an understanding. Hopefully. Hopefully of healthy sexuality. But what that assumes is that when the parents give that talk to the children, that the children are totally ignorant of that area of their life, because their sex drive hasn't awakened yet. They've had no experience in that area, and they're a blank slate. And they're being taught by parents about sexuality. But one of the sad things about trauma, and complex trauma, is that. often children are exposed to sex, are sexually abused. And when the parents go to parent them in that area, the children already have a whole bunch of issues. And the parents really begin a process of trying to help them understand healthy sexuality versus unhealthy sexuality. And that is really what reparenting is for people coming out of trauma. And that is really what reparenting is for people coming out of trauma. And that is really what reparenting is for people coming out of trauma. It's helping yourself deal with some of the unhealthy sexuality that you've been exposed to.

To do that, that's my second purpose, which is to realize how big of an issue this is. That sexual abuse is just not something you go, oh that didn't affect me. No, sexual abuse has ramifications into every area of life. It affects how we think, it affects our mental health, it affects our emotional world, it affects our physical world, it affects our relational world, it affects our marriage, it affects our parenting. And I want to lay out for you the ramifications of sexual abuse, hopefully that you go, wow, I see myself there.",

And that can become a problem. And for many of them, they actually have to go to abstinence for a while because this is such a difficult area to figure out what healthy sex is. But what's really needing to happen for people is I need to figure out the difference between healthy sex and unhealthy sex. And in my own life, I need to figure out when I'm in healthy sex but then when I cross over into unhealthy sex. where's the boundary for me to be able to figure out. , I need to figure out the key between healthy sex and unhealthy sex. that is part of the journey for people. I want to begin by just giving you some 10 statistics around sexual abuse. first of all, what they've found, and this makes statistics really difficult, is that out of 100 sexual assaults, only 6 are reported as sexual assaults. that's only 6. What I want you to understand is that coming up with accurate statistics is difficult and most of the statistics are on the low side when it's probably higher. Only about 1-2 of date rape is ever reported. again, those are just to be aware of. , 60 of sexual abuse or assault victims are reported as sexual assaults. However, assault victims are under the age of 17. Over 80 of sex crimes are women. 80 of sexual assault incidents occur in the home. And that's really important to understand. 17 of girls under 16 have experienced some form of incest. Now when we come to the world of addiction and trauma, all of a sudden the numbers jump significantly. about 2 thirds of women who are addicts or with complex trauma, 2 thirds of the women have been sexually abused. And about half of men. when I'm dealing with people from complex trauma or an addiction, it's almost safe to assume that they probably have some type of sexual abuse. Half of all sexual offenders are married or in long-term relationships. this isn't necessarily something that's just done by single people. 80 of assailants are friends and family of the victim.",

One of the things that I get often in dealing with people who are, were sexually abused is that sometimes they experimented with other kids their own age. it was more than maybe playing doctor. They did things together. And now they realize that some of the people they experimented or included in their sexual activities, they ended up kind of screwed up in life. They got into drugs. They got into a lot of stuff or they committed suicide and they go, it's my fault. If I hadn't included them in my activities, they would never have turned out the way they had. it's all my fault that they're messed up. That's a terrible guilt to carry. And you have to think this through carefully. Why did you include them in your activities. What, why before the age when your sex drive was awakened, did you include them. And it's because you were exposed. , who exposed you. Isn't it maybe you. Isn't it maybe their fault. And that it's a tough one, but it's something that many people who come out of sexual abuse end up finding themselves engaged with others and their lives get messed up and they feel a ton of guilt around that. let me just for clarity's sake give a definition of sexual abuse. I want to just give a formal definition that you can get off the internet. It's basically that sexual abuse is when any person, whether a parent, caregiver, family member, teacher, family friend, babysitter, or a stranger, involves a child or young person in any kind of sexual activity. This could mean being forced or manipulated into taking part in a sexual act, inappropriate touching, or being involved in any kind of sexual behavior which may not involve touching. It could happen just once or it might happen repeatedly over a period of time. the focus of that definition is on childhood sexual abuse. Let's expand that to sexual abuse beyond childhood sexual abuse. it would be having sexual activities forced upon you, which would include improper touching, forced to have intercourse, which could be rape, oral sex, anal sex, bestiality.",

Or it can be exposure to porn, or sexual activity as a child. all of those would incorporate sexual abuse definition. Now I'm always asked, what about playing doctor. And what we're really asking there is as our sexual drive awakens, we develop a sexual curiosity to know about other people. Do they have the same parts as me. And there's that curiosity, and playing doctor is just that exploring of curiosity. Where it can cross a line into unhealthy or into sexual abuse is when that exploration becomes a regular occurrence, where I want to keep pursuing this because it's more than curiosity now, it does something in the mind. It awakens sensations inside of me. It awakens sensations inside of me that I now want to feed. And that then can turn into sexual abuse. there's more to this that I want you to understand. sexual abuse is just not restricted to the person was violated sexually. There's other dynamics that are going on. the next big dynamic is sexual abuse is always or usually always perpetrated by someone the child trusts. And what is happening there is it becomes then an extreme act of betrayal of trust, violation of trust. That is important to understand. And , when we talk about the trauma of sexual abuse, it's not just a traumatic event. That does great damage in a child's life moving forward whenever it comes to trust. Secondly, it is trauma. It is a traumatic event. And if it happens over and over again, it is a complex trauma event. And we are actually dealing with a child who's been traumatized. And that is important to understand and we'll come back to that. let me move into the ramifications around sexual abuse. Long-term ramifications that can go on for years into their adult life, into their marriages.",

Mal-adaptations to their complex trauma that are messing up their adult life. there's a lot of 60 different things that have come out of the childhood sexual abuse that now make their adult life very difficult. Another common long-term ramification is a distorted view of sex. what happens when a drug. a human drive sex, which normally would be awakened at 10 to 12 years of age, what happens when a drive is awakened before its time. usually it can go to a hyperdrive or a totally shut off. the hyperdrive is that when you get to your teens, all of a sudden you are just focused on sex. And you become very promiscuous. Sex. For you is what life is all about. And that's what you think is going to make you happy. Or you can go the other way. You just want nothing to do with sex. Sex just triggers memories. sex you see is dirty. Sex, if you get married and all of a sudden your partner wants sex, you just freeze up. It's not something you enjoy. Or you can go through. You perform the necessary actions with your partner and try to act you enjoy it. But it's no pleasure for you. What I want you to understand from that is this. If that's the way sexual abuse has affected you, you can see that will lead to major marriage issues around the sexual part of your relationship. And I've seen many marriages fall apart because of that. Because the partner didn't deal with their sexual abuse. Another thing that can come out of that is the person then uses masturbation as their way of self-soothing. And it becomes that distorted view of sex is that sex is just about calming down, feeling better, relieving stress. It becomes just an all-out. It becomes just an all-out. It becomes just an ongoing part of their life that is used to solve all kinds of emotional problems. Then for some, their distorted view of sex is sex was their way of getting attention.",

And if somebody's in authority, you go, I'm not sure I can trust authorities because they always seem to abuse power. trust gets interrupted and affected. But then there's all kinds of triggers that can happen for people with sexual abuse. now watching certain movies can trigger you. Just participating in healthy sex can trigger a whole bunch of memories and put you in a bad place. Seeing certain people can trigger you. Going certain places can trigger you. Even somebody coming up beside you and touching you. Not in a sexual way, but just that touch triggers you. Certain gestures that people make, certain sounds, certain smells, all can trigger you. And then another long-term ramification is that guilt piece. But then a huge one, and I think most people don't understand how big this is, is the shame. That I'm not good enough. Something's wrong with me. I don't have value outside of my sexual identity. Shame consequences that come out of sexual abuse are massive. And then, for some, they dissociate. during the sexual abuse, they detach from their body. They dissociate it. they had an out-of-body experience. They went to a fantasy land. They just became catatonic. But what can happen moving forward is they become just good at dissociating from uncomfortable emotions. Disconnecting from how they're feeling. Escaping to fantasy land. They don't really want to deal with anything. the thing, the dissociation that enabled them to survive now has become problematic in a healthy life as an adult. Many that come out of sexual abuse have a distorted view of love. They see love only in terms of sex. They don't understand love outside of sex. Or they see love as selfishness. Because the person that was sexually abusing them was saying, I love you. But now they see that person was just being selfish. maybe love is just selfishly getting what you want. there's distortions there.

But then some people, they then see sex as basically the main tool of trying to keep the relationship. And they think, I'm going to try to keep the relationship healthy. if there's conflict, let's just have sex. That's their way of resolving it. If I feel you're drifting apart a little bit, instead of talking about it, let's just have sex. sex was the glue that brought us together because we were attracted sexually. Now let's use sex as the glue that keeps us together. whenever there's a problem in the relationship, let's just have sex. you're putting the health of the relationship, all the weight is now put on sex. And that's too much weight for sex to bear. Then some people come in and go, sex is the way to manipulate my partner to get me what you want. if you want sex with me tonight, then you have to do this for me. Or if my partner's thinking of leaving me, sex is the way of keeping them from leaving me I'll never get abandoned. sex becomes a manipulation thing within a relationship. But then sex is the way to get me out of it. And sadly, what we have found is people who've been sexually abused or traumatized, they tend to be attracted to abusive people. People that will abuse them again. Because that was their normal. That's kind of how they knew how to relate. There's something in them drawn to that. And they have a greater chance of being abused again. And then, what happens from there. And then, what happens from there. And then, what happens from there. For many people with sexual abuse is they end up with behaviors in their relationships that get diagnosed as borderline personality. And we're going to look at that in a few weeks as to what exactly that looks. But it can come out of sexual abuse. And then for others who've been sexually abused, it leads to self-harm urges as a way to punish themselves. Or, I said, it leads to re-victimization.",

I hope what you're beginning to see is sexual abuse affects you for years and years. And it affects you, your thinking, your physical health, your mental health, your emotional health. It affects all your relationships. It is huge. Now sadly, some people have responded by saying, it didn't bother me. They minimize it. It's their brain's way of trying to move on. To get over it. But what I want you to understand is that it doesn't work. The only way to heal sexual abuse is to face it honestly. To see it accurately. To begin to be honest. To begin to be honest about how it has affected you. Minimizing it. Rationalizing it. Denying it. Doesn't lead to moving on. It always leads to more problems. what I thought I'd do is share with you the story of one of our staff at Lyft. Anita. And she's given me permission and written out her story for me. it says, For years I've struggled with this separate identity that lived inside me called my sexual identity. This identity had its own set of rules. Its own moral compass of what's wrong, or wrong behavior. A whole separate way of thinking and it got me into more trouble than I can shake a stick at. I was at a respectable office party with my closest work peers wearing my modest yet classy evening wear. I was being charming, intelligent, engaging, fun. And completely in control. Then wham. Little Miss Sexual Identity wakes up and hijacks the operating system. And I am not me anymore. Was I invited to a lot of parties and social functions. Oh you bet I was. In my twenties and thirties I was really popular. I was a lot of fun. But then of course the next morning Miss Sexual Identity was nowhere to be found.

Sometimes, though, I will have to sacrifice my needs in order to meet your needs, and sometimes you'll sacrifice your needs to meet mine. But overall, it'll be equal still. But what happens in complex trauma is very different. Complex trauma always will have somebody in the leadership position who abuses authority, who has narcissistic tendencies, who's a narcissist. And when a narcissist has a family, a child, at first they're very excited because they want to show this child off. Because it. creates these warm feelings inside of them. They feel love. And they love getting hugged by the child. It's a beautiful, beautiful thing. But after a while, this child, their needs don't go away. They have lots of needs. They need time. They need attention. They need the parent to make sacrifices, to go without sleep sometimes. And to a narcissist, they don't that. That's cramping their style. That's keeping them from getting. having everything the way they want it. They it. And sadly, what can happen in many homes is that the narcissist distorts reality and says to the child, you're being selfish for having needs. Instead of admitting that they, the parent, are being selfish and not wanting to sacrifice, they twist it and tell the child, you're being selfish. And the child begins to get the message that they're a burden. That they're making lots of money. They're making life inconvenient for the people caring for them. And they begin to develop this shame. I don't feeling I'm making everybody else's life miserable. That must mean I'm a terrible person. And it begins to do a lot of damage because the child is always feeling that they're a burden. let me give you 18 questions, a little test, to see if you have the characteristics of a person who sees themselves as potentially being a burden or who's afraid of being a burden to others. number one, you find it very hard to ask for help.

Do I matter to anybody. Do I make a difference in anybody's life. Do I have anything to offer to people around me. Do I have value. That is a huge question all of us have.

    "output": "there's a couple of things. Number one, as much as we may not realize that we are affected by our culture in answering those questions. as we look at Hollywood and culture advertising, what it is doing constantly is telling us, here is what makes a person valuable. Here is what makes a person lovable and desirable. And every child growing up in our culture is getting this presentation from culture. If you want to be lovable, you need a perfect body. If you want to be lovable, you have to have certain characteristics about how you behave, about your money, about your position, about your possession. All of those things are subconsciously and overtly sent to our children and to all of us about what the standard is to be lovable and valuable. But beyond that, we have to have certain characteristics about how we behave. And beyond that, we then interpret how people treat me as answers to those questions. if people treat me a certain way, I go, I guess I have value, or I guess I'm lovable. And then we pay attention to what people say to us. And what they say to us also answers those questions. those three things begin to shape our self-identity. Now introduce complex trauma. And this has the most profound effect on what shapes a child's identity because what a child has got going on in their mind when they're being abused or neglected or their needs aren't being met or they're being abandoned is they're saying, this must be my fault. I must have done something or I must be not good enough. That is causing this treatment to be happening to me. Let me take that a little bit further to help you kind of get in your mind what begins to happen in a child's mind at a subconscious level. A child might say, because my dad is always too busy at work, that must mean I do not matter. Instead of saying dad's got a problem, the child says it means I don't have value or I must not be lovable. And if dad is always watching the TV when you want to talk or he kind of half listens while he works, you begin to get the message to you, I must be a bit of a burden to my dad.",

And I'm not talking about, oh, you should be ashamed of yourself. Shame is that core belief about my identity. It's a core belief about who I am in terms of value and being lovable and being worthwhile. And shame is a negative belief that I'm not good enough and that I'm not lovable and that I am a burden.

And you could be saying, I am going to be the most successful kid because I'm going to use my brains and my abilities, and you get a good job.

And all the more when you're in a very self-reliant world, it's certainly anything but natural to think that one should need help in figuring out what normal is. said. I want to go to kind of four major ways that the sexual drive in a child can get distorted or twisted. the obvious one is sexual abuse. That does much damage in a child that distorts sexuality sometimes. And this is hard to say, but important to say sometimes almost irreparably. I have worked for many years in counseling people with sexual abuse. And sadly, what I've seen with some is that they may never heal to the point. I think that's the key to being able to engage in a healthy intimate sexual relationship. There's just too much damage been done. Too many things get triggered today as soon as they go to engage in sex. It's just sad. Others, they may finally eventually get to a more healthy sexual place and be able to have a healthy sexual relationship with somebody. But it could take years, years and years to get to a healthy sexual relationship. And that's the only way to get to a better adult, that's the only way to get to a better virgin. great patience is required, tons of work is required. There's not a magic fix to just make it go away. Sting andsolvilleblog alright. entrepreneursrubbing. com The second thing and we're going to develop this today that really messes up sexuality is neglect. And most have never really considered that before. And I really want to explained that as we go into our talk today. Whagramughter Arthur Director soundtrack The third thing is grow up in a family where one of your parents has unresolved issues around sex. anything that is sexual in the child, the parent overreacts to. And that can do tremendous damage and really distort the sexual drive of the child. The fourth thing is parents or growing up in an environment that has very repressive teaching around sexuality, almost puritanical. some of you have grown up where it's been taught or you just pick up that sexual desires, having sexual desires, that you're bad, that you're doing something wrong, that's a terrible thing to have sexual desires.",

    "output": "But also with that, what can happen for a child is if they're sexually abused at that age, something in their brain goes, I am getting validation. This is what I'm good at. This is what I have value in my sexuality, my body, my looks. And now their whole validation is based on those things. And. And that sex is a way to get the validation they need to meet their validation need. And it gets distorted. And they begin to pursue sex constantly because they're seeking the validation and being desirable. The flip side is they can go to asexuality. they have zero interest in sex. sex to them has been dirty. It's hurt them. It's disgusting. And they just don't want it. And if they go to have sex, it triggers all kinds of flashbacks or they just feel dirty. They feel tremendous amounts of guilt. And they just don't want anything to do with sex. Some of these people often end up hating their body because they think their body's the culprit. It made others desire to sexually abuse them. they hate their body. Some then begin overeating as a way to gain weight that they're less desirable in their body. And that then becomes an issue for many people that struggle with obesity. Something else that can happen and it's a blend of the two is for many people that come out of neglect or abuse is they are attracted to somebody, but there's been shame that's developed. They think they're not enough themselves. when they go to start a relationship with somebody, they think the only way to attract this person and be desirable is to give lots of sex. And in the beginning of the relationship, there's just constant sex. It's hyper sex. But then as soon as the relationship starts to grow and move towards deeper intimacy, they back away from sex. They don't want to go any further into intimacy. And sex is a way to attract this person. And they're attracted to this person. But then as soon as the relationship starts to grow and move towards deeper intimacy, sex becomes less and less frequent. And in some cases, it becomes non-existent. And it starts with hyper sex and it goes towards asexual.",

Another thing that comes out of complex trauma is just this longing for connection but don't know how to connect. And now, when I have sex, I have the feelings of connection. I go, oh, that just solved all my connection issues. And then another issue that comes out of complex trauma is that haunting fear, I'm going to be abandoned. And every time I'm afraid I'm going to be abandoned, oh, I better go have sex because then the person wants me and they're not going to abandon me. now, sex is not just seen as the solution to all my needs and my love needs. It's now seen as a solution to all of the issues that come out of complex trauma. Now, I need to take this, and this to me is such a significant piece to understand. it's important to understand that there's two types of sex. there's pure just physical sex or animal sex or genital sex. It's just the physical stuff that happens that creates orgasm. But then there's attachment-based sex. And that is sex that takes place not just because physical stimulation, but because of a moment of silence. And that's the way that I'm going to be abandoned. Emotional needs being met because of pure healthy connection and safety happening. That is the most satisfying type of sex. That is when sex gives the greatest pleasure. what is necessary for attachment-based sex. number one, it will only happen if both partners feel safe.",

But for many from complex trauma, that's not true. But for many from complex trauma, that's not true. Because what happens is they're afraid to express their needs, and they walk around on pins and needles, hinting at sex, that they're interested, wanting sex, hoping their partner will offer sex, but they're afraid to say anything. And it just adds stress, it adds anxiety, then it adds anger when their sexual needs aren't being met and their partner's not responding. if you can just say, let's go for a time where we just plan, we're going to have sex, we're going to work towards that, we're going to spend ourselves preparing for it, getting in the mood, it can actually help couples as they develop healthy sexual lives. Next thing is in your own life, learn what healthy sexuality is for you and what unhealthy sexuality looks for you. for many people, there will be times when masturbation is actually a healthy thing. There's going to be times when it's not. There's going to be times when masturbation is a very unhealthy thing. You need to know the difference. There are going to be times when you're looking forward to sex with your partner and you start to fantasize about having sex with your partner, and that can be very healthy. But there will be times when that can become unhealthy and that can take you to very dangerous places in your mind. Then you're going to have to learn when it comes to frequency,. I might have a greater sexual drive now than my partner does, I want it more often than they do. do I just want them to give in and give themselves to me every time I want it, or do I need to learn some self-control we find a balance that sometimes I do without, sometimes they make a sacrifice.

But it's an even greater challenge for people in recovery. And I got quite a long list and some of you will relate to every single one of the points that I'm going to make. But the first major issue around money and recovery is that money can be a trigger to use. And what I have seen over years in working with people in recovery is that for some people that very first payday once they're in recovery also becomes relapse day. Because they get that first paycheck and their brain goes to boy let's party. The second thing that can happen with people is just even having money in your pocket is a trigger. I know some addicts who when they get their paycheck they spend it all just to get rid of the money they're not going to be tempted. They don't have any money left for groceries but they spend it all and the temptation is gone. And money can be a huge trigger especially when you begin to look at meth being sold for less money. And even having a little bit of money can be a problem. But not just having money can be a trigger. Not having money can also be a trigger for some people. And if you don't have money, you're not going to be tempted. And if you don't have money, you're not going to be tempted. not having money can be a trigger to start your boosting career up again and getting some money or do a few bit of dealing, deal some drugs, get some quick money or turn a couple of tricks and get some fast money. And not having money can be a trigger. And then for some people, having a credit card or a debit card is just too big of a trigger. It is something that they cannot do. It is something that they cannot handle. if you're in recovery, you probably relate to some degree to that.",

Then you have money becomes this cause or source of conflict but also stress. I don't know many people coming into recovery out of addiction who don't have money. I don't know many people coming into recovery out of addiction who don't have money. I don't know many people coming into recovery out of addiction who don't have debts. They don't have a huge saving account. That's all been gone. They got a lot of debt. And debt adds a lot of stress to life. Then for many people coming in out of complex trauma, your brain is still instant gratification. And part of what you've done in your life is just make lots of impulsive decisions. you buy stuff before you thought about it. Just because you feel buying it in that second of time. And impulsive decisions can mean coming home with a new TV and laptop. But then the stress that comes up after that and the conflict that comes after that is great. And then some people get in a relationship and they spend a whole bunch of money and they come home and they didn't ask the other person if it was to go and buy something. And then they go and spend 500. They just did it and now they've got a huge conflict. I have found that the majority of people in recovery would brand themselves as poor money managers. There's some that manage money , but those are the exception. Most have not learned how to manage their money. And they tend to waste money and then struggle to pay bills. All of that adds stress and creates conflict. Some who come out of complex trauma have hoarding issues. And I'm going to talk about that a little bit later. But that is tied in with the money thing and that can become a source of great conflict. Not just with a partner but with family and friends as. And then many people that come out of complex trauma, even poverty and addiction, can have a very distorted view of success. And they can come into recovery thinking that if I just get enough money to buy what I want, then I'll be happy.",

    "output": "their definition of happiness and success is tied into getting lots of money. And they set themselves up for disappointment. I also have encountered many clients, who grow up in a family where parents have defined success by the possessions you own, the house you live in, and the child still gets pressure from the parent to have certain things to prove that they're successful. And the parent wants the child to have it because that child is an embarrassment to the parent if they don't have it. they get lots of pressure. And our culture gives us the same message. I have also found that many clients coming out of complex trauma and poverty often look at people with lots of money and because they wear a smile in public, they think those are happy people. And then they're envious of them. And they walk around saying, if I just had what they had, then I would be happy. And I often say, do anything about their private life. Because just because they wear a smile doesn't mean they're happy. But that is what can easily happen. And one of the things that's really important to understand up front is this. Money is a big part of what is necessary to meet needs. And what is very easy to think is that more money is the solution to my problems. I hope that's a lie. That just having external things does not make me a happy person. That happens from a healthy internal life, not from more things. , now it's really hard for people in addiction to manage money when they come into recovery. But let me take it to the third level. And that's the challenges for people with complex trauma. And there's two main areas I want to focus on, and then I'll add a couple extra after that. If you come from complex trauma, life for most people in complex trauma is unstable. You're not sure what mood dad's going to be in today, that is iffy all the time you walk on eggshells. Some of you don't know if you're going to have food to eat on any given day, because mom and dad spend it all on drugs and alcohol. there's lots of fighting that makes life unstable. Parents aren't consistent. They're not a rock. And your life is marked by instability.",

    "input": "Can you explain how complex trauma affects someone and what the path to recovery looks like?",
    "output": "And that is what creates some of the trauma. Because you feel a little child, all alone, facing all of this instability, and you don't feel strong enough to handle it. you're traumatized by it. What is easy for people to do as they get older is think that if I have lots of money in the bank, then that will be what gives me stability. That is a lie. But it is really easy to think that, because if you've got lots of money in the bank, then you think I can handle anything that comes up that might make my life unstable. But again, it's looking for stability. You're looking for stability in external only. And that will let you down. And many people begin to think, especially in our culture, that if I want a safe and stable and secure future, I need to squirrel all my money away that I'm prepared. Now it's wise to be prepared financially for the future if you can, but that shouldn't be the main source of stability. Now what can happen also if a person thinks that way is they begin to then think, I need lots of money or my future is insecure, I better be a workaholic. And then they work and work and they lose their kids, they lose their marriage, because money now is in control of their life. And that is a very dangerous thing. be careful and be aware if you find yourself looking to money to fill that security need. It will disappoint you. Second one, and this is probably the biggest one, is to see money and shame, money and my sense of value. what happens in complex trauma is you end up with this thing called shame. you feel the reason I was neglected and abandoned and abused is I'm bad. Something's wrong with me. I'm not good enough. And you develop a core belief that says I'm not good enough, I'm not valuable. what can then happen is a whole bunch of things that will intersect with money. first one, some of you with lots of shame, just the fact that you're poor today feeds your shame and triggers your shame and seems to prove to you that you're not good enough because you're still poor. be aware of that one.",

But your family keeps saying, why aren't you working yet. You should be a responsible parent and you're not. And they feed your shame. be aware of those things. I have had many clients say I got to quit recovery, quit treatment and go back to work. Because I got to prove that I'm the provider for my family. And I say, I don't see this turning out. But they feel that pressure and it's shame driven. , next thing. If you grew up with lots of shame and you figured everybody looked down on you and nobody respected you because after all they didn't respect you at home. Boy, if you had money, people all of a sudden respected you. And now you're thinking money is what gains me respect. Secondly, if you grew up with lots of shame then you didn't feel you fit in anywhere. You never belonged. You felt all alone in a crowd. And then as soon as you had lots of money, man, you had friends coming out of your ears. Everybody wanted to be your friend. You all of a sudden fit in. And you go, wow, money helps me belong. And you get that message into your brain. Another part of shame is you feel a total failure. But now when you got money that proves you're not a failure. It proves you're a success. And now you see money as a solution to feeling a failure to proving that you're a success. Then part of shame is I have to wear a mask. Because if people get to know the real me they will reject me everybody else has. And money enables you to establish an image that people. And people respect. And again it seems to make or become the solution to your problems. And the final shame one, shame makes me feel inferior. But if I have lots of money, I feel superior to everybody else.",

You can buy drugs, alcohol, and activities and have endless distractions that take you out of the pain and give you some pleasure. And again people can think money is the solution to my pain and money is solution to my emptiness. And then whenever you're discontented, money buys you stuff to do. Money gives you that high for a little while and it seems to fill the emptiness inside of you. Now be aware of another part of complex trauma and that is you create a complex trauma in your kids, most likely. And what happens with that is you carry this guilt. And what can happen if you are struggling to pay the bills, you feel extra guilty that you can't get your kids lots of gifts. And I have seen many people go into debt further because their guilt at not giving their kids all the nice things of our culture has driven them to a very bad decision. And then that can add a whole bunch of stress later. do you see that. All of those things that have developed there coming out of complex trauma is distorted perspectives on money. And those distorted perspectives on money can result in having the wrong attitude toward money. And that's what I want you to think about now. understand up front, money is not a bad thing. Money is neutral. I hear clients say, sometimes, money is the root of all evil. And I say, you haven't read your , if that's what you think. The says the love of money is the root of evil. Not anything wrong with money, it's my attitude toward money. That's the issue. And that's what I want you to understand is it's really easy to have the wrong attitude toward money.

But for those of you that are, give that some thought. But here's the key thing. If greed's the wrong attitude towards money, what's the attitude. It's contentment. Contentment with what I have. Doesn't mean it'd be nice to have this, but I am not going to sacrifice the important things of my life to get this and hurt those things. I am content with what I have where I'm at. And learning contentment is a really thing. And we're going to talk about that further in this series. Final thing, many people in early recovery can't have a credit card or a debit card. Give that some thought. If you are beginning to realize that is tripping you up repeatedly, begin to look at cutting them up or giving them to somebody else that it's not a temptation. , I hope this helps. Some of you, when I mentioned that we're going to be talking about money, I got all this, oh, money. It's such a problem area in my life. I hope you see that it's an important area to get under control and to learn to be healthy in. , it's the part and we've been going through or started looking at what I consider to be the best example in the of complex trauma. And it's when Israel, the people of Israel, about three million come out of slavery. And they had spent generations being slaves, mistreated, etc. by the Egyptian people. when they come out of that slavery, all of a sudden you see these people that have all the 60 characteristics of complex trauma that we talk about.",

And what it's basically saying in the title is, we used to say to people who were in jail, who got into drugs, what's wrong with you. But because of understanding trauma, the better question is, what's wrong with you. And why is it that you have to say that to people who are in jail, who got into drugs. What's wrong with you. But because of understanding trauma, the better question is, is what happened to you. What you're doing is a response to what happened to you. It's not necessarily pointing to what's wrong with you as if it's a moral deficit. It's something happened to you that made you have to respond this way to survive. trauma is a key piece in understanding many of these things. let me begin by talking about why do we get dysregulated. What dysregulates us. basically it's anything that activates our stress system. a couple things that will do that. I want to give you a series here. Think of the fact of all your internal systems that you have. you have a system that has kind of a border on what is healthy as far as the amount of water in your body. The temperature of your body. Your head space. Your mental health state. if you're in the parameters, you've got enough food, enough water, you're in a good head space, you're in balance. And everything is good. But let's say you don't get enough water. Or you get cold. It triggers your stress system because you're out of balance. Something is wrong. And if it doesn't get corrected quickly, you're going to be in big trouble. And you get the sensation of thirst. The sensation of hunger. Because your stress system is activated. You shiver because your stress system is activated. anything, anytime when your basic. Your 12 needs, which we talk about all the time. Anytime those aren't met. Emotional, physical, relational, spiritual needs. Those aren't being met. Then your stress system is activated. And that can cause emotional dysregulation. think of a baby. They're hungry. Activates their stress system. They cry. They're cold. Activates their stress system. They cry. There's a response that says something's out of balance.",

    "output": "for most of us, if we're completely honest, we have to begin to realize, there's probably a whole bunch of very subtle fears just below the surface of all the unknowns in life, of all the things that could happen that are beyond my control. Car accidents, dementia, cancer, other sicknesses, financial problems, relationship problems, something bad happening to our kids. The list goes on and on of things that could happen that are beyond our control. How do we live with these fears in a healthy way. That's what I want to talk about. I want to just identify seven that I think are some of the biggest fears beyond our control that many have. one would be fear of growing old. That's a terrifying thing for many people. Fear of getting sick. Fear of dying. The fear that those closest to me will no longer be there for me. The fear that there will be consequences that I face today for decisions that I made in the past that were not good decisions. And now the consequences are going to come home to roost and haunt me. The fear that others will destroy my reputation. And in a world of social media, people can put all kinds of garbage out about you that could just destroy your reputation beyond your control. They can spread lies, all kinds of libel, that kind of thing. And then the fear that our child will make a bad choice that will deeply affect them negatively. I just put those as what I would say are kind of the top seven fears for many. And then the fear that others will destroy my reputation beyond their control. let me show you how complex trauma really messes with this fear thing and can cause extra problems. to begin with, we need to say again that fear originally was designed to be a good thing. It was designed to protect us. when we're in a dangerous situation where we could get hurt, fear. Is an emotion that says this is not safe to be here. You need to get out of here. You need to go to fight or flight. Fear was designed to be a very good thing. The problem with complex trauma is that fear could not be resolved by the child.",

You create, I must be in danger all the time, belief in your brain. That's why I have to be hypervigilant. now I'm always acting based on life is dangerous. And you're actually creating fear. that one doesn't work. But then comes fear. But then complex trauma creates underlying issues that actually feed fear. you're trying to deal with fear, but you don't realize that there's other things that just keep feeding fear over and over constantly in your life. shame. Shame is basically a fear emotion. It's basically I'm not good enough. Anybody that gets to know the real me will reject me. every time now I'm in a relationship. I feel fear. Because I'm pretty sure that if they get to know me, they're going to reject me. And that's scary. shame is constantly feeding fear in a person. That then leads to codependency that comes out of complex trauma. I need you to me in order for me to feel good about myself. I need you to meet my needs. But you can't see the real me because I'm pretty sure you're going to reject me. we're going to do this constant dance. And I'm hoping that you're going to meet my needs. I'm hoping that you're going to want me and me. But I'm pretty sure you won't. And that creates fear. codependency is basically relationships that are formed that have shame and fear at their very core. And then what comes out of complex trauma for many is a fear of failure. failure is not a good thing where I learn from. Failure is always a bad thing. That leads to more pain because I get judged and criticized and condemned and shunned. I'm constantly needing to be perfect. I'm constantly needing to make everybody happy. And I set unrealistic standards for myself. That just creates more fear because I can't be perfect. I can't meet those standards. Another thing that comes out of complex trauma is I put my value in the wrong things. I don't believe I have inherited. I don't believe I have a current value. That I'm not valuable just the way I am.",

That creates fear. If my value comes from my accomplishments, which then becomes my job, what happens as I face retirement. I no longer have my job to give me value. Who am I then. What will my source of value be. That creates fear. If my value comes from my possessions, from my wealth, my money, what happens if the economy changes. What happens if my financial world gets upset. That creates fear. every time I place my source of value in externals, I create an environment where fear is going to be there. I can be fed whenever anything changes. Another thing that comes out of complex trauma is trust issues. And think of it this way. What enables a child to be at peace and not have fear. It's not because they have all kinds of tools. It's because their parents that they've connected with and that they know love them have tools. And they trust their parents. And because they trust totally, they have peace. They don't have fear. trust becomes an important piece when it comes to dealing with fear. Now what happens as the child gets older is they learn the tools from their parents they can handle more and more situations. they begin to trust themselves. For some people, there's a spiritual component to this where they trust themselves. They trust a higher power to help them in situations. But trust of others, of self, of higher power becomes key in dealing with fear. But what happens with complex trauma. It destroys trust. You don't even trust yourself. you don't have tools. You don't yourself. You don't the decisions you've made in your life in the past. And you just stop trusting others. You don't trust yourself, a higher power. And now you're basically facing the world alone with no trust, no tools. And that feeds fear. Then there's another element to complex trauma. And that is initially in complex trauma you go to fight or flight whenever there is fear, whenever you're in danger. But then what the brain does to try to protect you is it goes through a process.",

Any emotion that is uncomfortable, the brain is pretty sure it's going to lead to a dangerous situation. now instead of going to fight or flight whenever there's danger and there's legitimate fear, it now goes to fight or flight as soon as it feels an uncomfortable emotion. Let's get out of here now. Let's get out of here early because we're pretty sure it's going to go to danger. what is happening with that is the brain is tolerating uncomfortable emotions less and less. Your capacity to sit in an uncomfortable emotion is diminishing. now the minute you feel an uncomfortable emotion, you get antsy. You get panicky. You want to get out of here. You want to escape. that comes out of complex trauma. Now every emotion actually is causing you fear. Then there's one other thing that comes out of complex trauma. And that is this. What happens in dealing with fear is we can deal with fear if our stress level has been fairly low, if we're rested and we have lots of energy. Because of those things, our emotional gas tank is full. Our bandwidth is broad. We're able to handle stuff a whole lot better because we have good energy, good resources available to us. But what happens if we're stressed out. What happens if we're exhausted. What happens if we're feeling overwhelmed. We just, the slightest little thing causes us to just want to run. The slightest little thing creates fear. We just don't have the bandwidth to deal with it. It's too much. And for a person coming out of complex trauma, their stress system is easily activated. They get overwhelmed easily. They're exhausted frequently. And it leaves them in a state that actually feeds fear. That just puts them in a place where they just want to get out of here. what I want you to see is, complex trauma takes this whole good emotion of fear and basically makes it a bad emotion and then creates all kinds of systems to try and help deal with it, but actually make things worse. They actually end up feeding fear. And fear becomes this thing that is getting worse and worse.",

And once that trigger happens, what follows from that is something that can happen in a nanosecond. But for most. people, it will follow a pattern. when your shame is triggered, it will trigger certain types of thoughts. It'll affect how you think. And you could be thinking in a very healthy way. Once your shame is triggered, your thoughts go in a very negative direction. But it doesn't just affect your thinking. It brings up other emotions, none of them positive, all of them negative, and they feed your thinking and make it even more. negative. Which. creates even more negative emotions and it starts feeding off of itself. And then that leads to actions, things that you do when you feel that shame trigger. And all of them are negative as. And they feed the thoughts and emotions in a more negative way. And you set up a system that only gets worse and worse inside of you. And it doesn't resolve the shame problem. And you have to start by understanding that system. And here's the main reason why. Everybody has a pattern. And it might start with thoughts and emotions and then it goes to behaviors. And the longer you're in shame, those behaviors become dominoes. They start falling. And if you stay in shame and don't resolve it, the dominoes usually will lead to a relapse. And for most people. without even realizing it, shame is one of their initial dominoes on the road to a relapse. Or it could lead to acting out in self-destructive ways, harmful ways to yourself and to your relationships. the earlier you can catch your pattern and stop the dominoes, the easier it will be to turn it around. But if you don't stop the dominoes, there comes a line. And once you cross that line, it's a line of no return. You are going to do something destructive to yourself. Either a relapse or something else. the whole point of self-awareness is to understand your triggers. Understand how they affect you that you can begin to change them.

If you say something, you're in a conversation with somebody, and you state something that you believe is a fact, and they say no, that's not , and they correct you, some of you go to shame. Or if you do a job and somebody says, can I give you some feedback. You go, -oh, what did I do wrong. And you go to shame.

You don't to feel shame, you switch to a second emotion. that rolling your eyes is a good example. What emotion do you go to immediately after you feel shame. Anger. Because you think if I'm feeling anger, then I won't feel the shame. And I'll feel empowered. anger becomes a secondary emotion for a lot of people to cover the shame emotion when they feel it. If somebody does something that in any way makes you feel stupid, you can go to shame. you're seeing there's all these different triggers. one of the things I ask clients is, how many times a day does your shame get triggered.

Somebody sitting there with their arms crossed looking at you with their brow furrowed. All of those things can produce or trigger shame.

And you just go to shame. We talked about when it takes longer than a minute to get others to learn a new skill. Some very practical ones. You'll get on the scale and you gained a couple pounds. Some of you go to shame. You look in the mirror and you got a new gray hair. And you go to shame. You look in the mirror and you got hairs growing out of your ears and nose.",

    "output": "And you go, I hated that about my dad and grandpa and now I'm the same. And you can go to shame. Everybody's got the latest technology and you can't afford it. That can cause shame in some people. Not being able to do what others can do. Anytime that you're in stressful situations and you're starting to panic a little bit, you can go to shame because you go, I should know this by now. I should know how to do this. And you get down on yourself. Being with friends who have very behaved kids and your kid's running around he's crazy. You can go to shame and you go home hating yourself that you're a terrible person. Having to ask anybody for help can trigger your shame. Because then you're admitting you don't have it all together. And you're a burden you feel to other people. Revealing to somebody that you respect that you're struggling or revealing a secret. Do you want to know what happens when people start to get authentic and open up. They let out a great big juicy secret for the first time. And it feels good. Nobody judges them. And then they go home and they start thinking about it. And they go, I can never go back and face those people again. I bet you they all went home and it's broadcast all over Facebook now and they're talking about it. And they've all judged me. They were nice in the group but I'm sure the next time they see them they'll just avoid me and won't even talk to me. that can feel good but it can trigger shame. what I want you to understand with that is this. Growing and changing in healthy ways can actually trigger shame. And that's important to understand because what's going to happen when you take the steps to begin to heal and grow is you're actually going to trigger shame and that's going to make you want to pull back. And you've got to push yourself through that to keep on growing. Another one, somebody comes over for a visit and they didn't announce that they were coming and your house is a mess, your sink is overflowing with dishes and that triggers your shame.",

You're trying to help your kids deal with their own trauma and you see growth in them and you think, this is going to work out.

Or our thinking goes to telling ourselves lies and that is you're useless, you can't do anything , nobody's ever gonna want you and it's all distorted.

But they can go there or they can just refuse to think about it and distract themselves with activities. But what they don't realize is it's still operating below the surface at a subconscious level. Some in their thinking go to messages of hopelessness. What's the point of all this work. They get it. I might as just give up. This is useless. I'm too stupid. Let's throw in the towel now and quit. And you can go there when shame gets triggered and in severe cases you can go to, I am useless, why don't I kill myself. that can all happen. And you see there, there is not one positive thought. Every thought is negative. But what I want you to understand is it only makes the shame worse. It doesn't make it better. the solution that the brain has that I need to beat myself up, that I need to be hard on myself, I need to put myself in the doghouse because bad people need punishment, that's my justice system, that does not resolve it. It only makes the shame worse. you need to understand that. Now very quickly, what emotions do you go to besides the shame. we said that shame technically is a belief. It's not first an emotion, but we do have what we call a shame emotion where I have a feeling of not being good enough. With that usually comes anger at myself. shame turns into anger at myself and then often at the world and I just become more irritable. For others, shame causes greater anxiety. now I'm going around, what do people think of me. Do they think I'm stupid. Is everybody looking at me differently. Am I pretty enough. Am I smart enough. And insecurity after insecurity. And then when you go to be in a social setting, you get anxiety comes up, all because of shame. Some go to depression and they just get really down.",

I've never seen anybody stay clean and sober if they don't deal with shame.

You didn't feel you belonged, you drank, and you felt you were part of the group. You felt socially awkward and shy, you drank, to be the life of the party. You were trying to solve your shame with drugs and alcohol. And your brain will still want to go back there today. And that's important to be aware of. , self-awareness. you can take that home. You can kind of map out your main shame triggers. And then you can see what you do in your thinking, emotions, and actions once your shame is triggered.

No, I tell you this that now, once your shame is triggered, and all of a sudden you realize you're getting down on yourself, and you're starting to beat yourself up, you can go, stop that.

You go, no, I'm going to force myself to go with friends that I know are safe, and I'm not going to give in to this shame impulse. this self-awareness is you can catch yourself before your shame gets too bad, and then it leads to a relapse. that might not have felt a pick-me-up, let's heal from shame solution.

I feel useless, I feel less than, not good enough, inferior. what I should have happened once I start feeling good about myself is that then I should have a job that's a big job. Because if I'm a nothing person, then I get nothing jobs. If I get my shame fixed, and I realize I'm an important, valuable person, then I should have a great big, important, valuable job.

Some of you say, I want to be a tongue because I want to talk all the time. Some of you, I want to be a brain. How many would sign up to be a lymph node or a vein. That's a dumb thing.

I should say you've reinforced that circuit a thousand times. You come into recovery and you say, I'm lonely. I am going to phone somebody. I'm going to go to a meeting.

I think I need to pick up. And you relapse. And what we again know is that for stress, for people coming from complex trauma, especially with those in addiction, it takes, when stress gets to a certain point, it takes them back to the old circuit, which is not just fight or flight, but for the addict, it's back to a relapse.

That's what we're going to be looking at. And again, let me add something to you who are addicts. What you'll find as we go through these 50 characteristics of complex trauma is that those 50 characteristics actually become relapse warning signs. And if you had these complex trauma and ended up in addiction, part of your addiction probably was doing a lot of these 50 things. And those became your addictive behaviors. And if you're in relapse mode, you will begin to do these 50 characteristics probably before you pick up the drug. And they are great little warning signs when you're heading down the wrong road. Now some of you, you might want to very secretively check off all of the ones that characterize you. And if you get all 50, you get a gold star. And we'll put your picture on the wall. No, we won't. But tonight we're going to get through 17 characteristics that make it difficult for a person from complex trauma to cope. And all of the 17 we're going to look at tonight are about coping. And then next week we're going to look at more that also are about coping. what you begin to realize is complex trauma, and I'm going to show you a couple of examples. what you begin to realize is complex trauma does a whole bunch of things inside of you that messes up coping. , the first one, and I've already referred to it, people out of complex trauma do not handle stress. Stress is something that is just a huge issue that can lead to relapse, that can lead to bad behaviors from the past. And stress sends off that alarm system. And often, if you want another way to say it, it reawakens the trauma. And I put up here some of the common things that cause stress that send this alarm system off and reawaken trauma. one of the most common ones is if you are in a position and all of a sudden you feel out of control, that you are powerless to affect the situation.",

    "output": "That sends you into trauma mode because I might get hurt, and that's stress, and you don't do with that. Or if you're overwhelmed, and that is you just have much on your plate, many responsibilities, many things going wrong, how can I cope with it all. Stress. Feelings of vulnerability. For many people, when you were vulnerable, when you expressed emotions, when you shared some very personal stuff, you got hurt. And as soon as you're in a position where you go, -oh, I bet you I shouldn't have said that, or oh, I just cried, oh, what's everybody thinking of me. That creates a lot of stress. If you are feeling threatened or attacked, if somebody is intimidating, if somebody is in your space and close to you, and they're. or somebody is angry or raises their voice with you, trauma gets triggered by that, and that therefore includes conflict and relationships. If you're in a fight, conflict, a big stress trigger, next one, separation or loss. All of a sudden, something that was in your life, which is very important to you, is out of your life. Causes great stress, reawakens trauma, because you're feeling abandoned again. Part of that is loneliness, because you begin to go through all that shame, nobody loves me, I must not be lovable, and all of the stress, and will I die this way, etc. Transitions, changes, create a lot of stress, and disruptions from the normal routine or schedule, and then reminders of past events. Now let me just say this about these things. If you come from complex trauma, you're probably very aware that if somebody comes up behind you and taps you on the shoulder, you kind of react. And they're probably lucky if they don't get punched, because that's the reflex in you,. For many of you, it's probably even greater than that and beyond that. For a lot of people coming out of trauma, huge anxiety disorders, difficulty focusing on a particular topic, but you may have trouble sleeping. Many of the people I deal with have always slept with a weapon close to their bed, either in their bedside table, under their pillow. Many never sleep with their back to the door. They always sleep with their back to the wall. Many never allow themselves to go into a deep sleep.",

And you will get grown men that still rock themselves in bed to try and soothe themselves and calm themselves down. All kinds of that stuff comes out of trauma, and when that trauma is kind of reawakened through stress, it just gets accented, magnified even more. , second characteristic that comes out of trauma, and I refer to it, but fear of change, fear of the unknown, fear of failure. What you're going to see is that what comes out of trauma is a lot of fear running your life. But there's fear of change and fear of the unknown. Why. Because if I go into a new situation, the unknown, which is brought about by change, and I don't know how to handle it because it's all new to me, I could get hurt. And what I see all the time is that when people finish treatment or they get a new job, all of a sudden there's this panic thing because I'm now entering change in the unknown, and it's a scary thing. And we'll look at it in a minute, what you do. But what many people do is this. I would rather stay in an unknown situation or an unhealthy, abusive situation than change and leave it. Why. Because at least I know what to expect here, and I kind of know how to handle it. But if I go into a new situation, can you guarantee to me that I'll never go through painful stuff again. Oh, you can't guarantee it. , I'll stay here. And that is how people respond. And in order to try and protect themselves from getting hurt, you see what you're doing. You're setting yourself up to get hurt even more. And that's what we're going to see over and over again. There's a subtle thing that comes out of this whole fear thing for many people, and it's fear of success. You may have that. And what it is, is if you consider that a kid coming out of trauma, they haven't had a lot of successes necessarily in life. They've had a lot of pain. They've had a lot of emptiness.

Because what they're afraid of is, I'm going to blow it, because I've never been this successful this long before, or the other shoe is going to drop. And many kids that come out of dysfunction, where there was abuse, would come home from school, and you would be listening for how dad sounded as he came in the door. You could probably tell by the way he closed the door, whether he was angry or not, whether he was in a good mood or not. You could tell by the tone of his voice. And if you went for two or three days where dad came home happy, you got nervous. Because the other shoe was about to drop. And you were pretty upset. And you were pretty certain you were going to have a very bad day in the very near future. that leads to the fourth thing that comes out of trauma. And that is, when things are going , or when there's change and the unknown, you go, I'll just sabotage it. I will destroy it I'm back to what I know is familiar. And it could be a good job. It could be recovery. It could be a good relationship. But you just sabotage what is familiar. And that's when things are starting to look up. Now let me explain that with the fifth thing. People who come out of trauma have a very conflicted relationship with hope. They long to have hope, but they're afraid to get their hopes up. I put a little line there with these bumps in it. let me explain it. If you grew up in a home of complex trauma, what you probably concluded is what we said last week, that the reason Dad is mad at me, the reason Dad is neglecting me, is because I'm doing something wrong. the line that's going up at kind of a 45-degree angle there is the child that says, what I need to do is try harder. And they're trying harder. I'm going to do extra chores. I'm going to make breakfast for Dad. I'm going to bring him his newspaper. I'm going to do everything I can to be a better child.",

    "output": "And you might keep getting up there 10, 20 times. But there's going to come a time where you go, I can't trust that. And I'm not going to jump anymore. let's say somebody else comes along who's totally trustworthy. And they say to you, jump, I'll catch you. What goes on in your head. You ain't got a chance, buddy. I know this game. And you're not going to get me to jump. You see what you've just done. You've cut yourself off from all kinds of help and all kinds of people. But that is the big issue. Number eight. Because you can't trust anybody, therefore I have to be in control. Control if I can only trust myself. And many trauma, complex trauma people end up being control freaks. And they, and if you want another way to say it, is basically, I'm going to try to be. And I'm going to try to control everybody around me that I don't get hurt and that I get my needs met. Sounds a great idea. Problem is nobody wants to cooperate with your plan. And it doesn't work. then you go, if I can't totally control people, I will develop the art of manipulating people. if I can't get my needs met by making everybody do what I want, in an overt way, what I will do is I'll get my needs met with more subtle games that I'm going to play. I'll pout, I'll give silent treatment, I'll do whatever, but I will become a master manipulator. And most people that come out of complex trauma, end up being manipulators. And that sounds great because it seems you're getting your needs met, but after a while, people don't want to be around you, and your relationships end up being in trouble. Number 10. When you grow up and your needs aren't being met and you're in complex trauma, one of the rules of complex trauma families is don't talk. Because if you talk, you're going to get either laughed at, or you're going to get punished, or it's going to get blabbed, whatever you say. you learn to be dishonest, and many people that come out of complex trauma, and this again is kind of flabbergasting to professionals, but they lie when it's just as easy to tell the truth.",

And in that filing cabinet, you would have a file cabinet, you would have a whole bunch of filing folders. you'd have one folder that says Tim, and what would be in that folder would be everything you've told me about your life. Then you'd have a next folder that would say Charlie, and you would keep track of everything you told Charlie, and they all start smiling. Because they're going, man, how did I had that file folder in my head, and I keep track of all my stories. I go, doesn't it take a lot of energy to keep track of all of that stuff. But people continue to do it even when they know it's to be honest. There's still something in them that says, I better lie just I somehow got a back door. Don't know why I need it, but I'm going to have my safety plan. that's a big issue. Next one, authority issues. the people that inflicted complex trauma were authority figures. Of course, you're going to have authority problems. And that's a huge issue. And sadly, in our culture today, many people in authority abuse that power and still do things that hurt you. Next one, we're flying along. Number 12, don't handle criticism. What I always find interesting is, we said last week, people with complex trauma end up with shame. And what is shame. You beat yourself up. I'm no good. I'm a failure. Can't do anything. Nobody would want to be with me. I'm fat. I'm ugly, etc. , etc. And then if you make a mistake and you're feeling embarrassed, tapes start playing in your head and you call yourself all kinds of names and you call yourself down and you're a pro at it. If anybody else pointed out any of those things to you, you'd be mad. You can criticize yourself, but nobody else can. You have a hypersensitivity to anything that smells criticism. And that becomes a problem because what you'll find is sometimes people have very helpful feedback, constructive criticism, but you're not hearing none of it. And you take away opportunities for growth and you don't cope when you're in an environment where you're giving each other feedback.",

It would just, I'm afraid something terrible would happen. I got to keep my anger repressed because I'm afraid to let it out even a little bit because I don't know how I could stop it. And that causes a lot of people to have a lot of guilt about their anger because if they've let it out a little bit, they've usually damaged somebody else. And that's created a lot of guilt. for them, their anger has only been used in negative, hurtful ways. And now they've got guilt on top of their anger. Most realize that their anger kind of has a nanosecond. And that's a trip switch. That something can happen and in a nanosecond, zero to 100, they lose it. They go from calm to extremely angry and it's not a pretty sight. And what is concerning to them is that they don't just have one thing that triggers their anger.",

Distress, on the other hand, is too much stress that I can't resolve that begins to pull me in a negative direction. let me take you to the child of complex trauma. Their needs are not being met. They're being hurt. They're in danger. they've got an environment that's constantly creating stress for them. They can't resolve it. Nobody's giving them the tools. Nobody's giving them the support to resolve it. they can't develop healthy ways to handle the stress. let me back up and say this. A child coming into the world has no natural tools to handle stress. They must be taught how to handle stress. they come to feeding themselves. That stresses them out. Mom and dad teach them how to feed themselves. Tying their shoes, riding their bikes, handling, making their bed. Every little problem causes them stress. Mom and dad come beside them, encourage them, validate them, teach them tools, and support them as they learn the skills. And what you can see is from zero to 20, a child is learning thousands and thousands of little tools that each one is handling a problem. Each one is creating a problem. Each one is expanding their window of tolerance for problem situations. What happens in complex trauma is nobody's coming along to teach them tools. Nobody's coming along to support them. they're not growing incrementally in their toolbox for handling the problems of life. What becomes their only way of dealing with the stress. Fight or flight or freeze. Get out of here. This is going to hurt us. And at a very early age, as soon as there's stress, even low level stress, that's jumping off point to fight or flight. let me go back. What is it that actually is happening when parents come beside a child and who faces a problem. they get dysregulated by the stress. This is too much for me. I can't handle it. They cry. The parents come and they connect. They act as co-regulators. The parents teach them the tools to meet that problem. The parent meets their needs. All of those are part of the learning to deal with stress. And complex trauma, the child doesn't get that. And they have a low stress tolerance and they're not even aware of it.",

That nobody wants to connect with me. And what that does is produces huge shame. I'm a zero. But also, produces a deep fear of abandonment. you've got two dynamics going on here that are important to understand. What does deep shame say. Everybody who gets to know me will abandon me. What does fear of abandonment say. I can't have anybody abandon me. I can't go through that pain again. I have to prevent being abandoned. you're split. I'm going to be abandoned, but I can't be abandoned. And that is what is working out in the. lives of people with complex trauma. this fear of being abandoned again with this belief that I will be abandoned again creates huge problems for people as they come into adult life. the first problem is a person who's abandoned, basically, everybody's going to abandon me because the two people that brought me into the world abandoned me. that means everybody who gets to know me will abandon me. now they twist everything that happens. They will distort the emotions in life to fit that script. they will distort what a person says, how they talk to them, what they didn't talk to them, their tone of voice, the wording, all of that will be twisted to be they don't me, they're about to abandon me. they get all of these s for it in their own mind that they quickly go to. They don't even acknowledge that I have a fear of abandonment. They just go, that person doesn't really love me. They're just using me. That's easy to go there. That sounds good. That's what I'm going to say. Or, oh, that person's being nice to me. They're probably talking behind my back. They're going to abandon me. They don't seem too excited to be around me today.

If you don't give me constant attention, if you develop your own hobbies, if you develop time with your friends, that means you're losing interest in me. And that means you're going to abandon me. You must never give me constructive criticism. You must never point out flaws in me. You must never get annoyed with me. That proves you find me unlovable and that you're planning to leave me. I would say that this fear of abandonment is one of the biggest issues for people coming out of more severe complex trauma. The problem is most aren't even aware of it. It's just a part of their subconscious. But when it gets triggered, they go to anger, they go to lashing out, they go to behaviors to try to prevent their shame being exposed, try to prevent being abandoned, and they can do a lot of damage. And learning to heal this deep abandonment wound is a key element of healing in recovery. those are the emotions that get affected by complex trauma. And I hope you see, wow, it does a ton of damage. But there is hope. You can heal that stuff. And it takes time. But once it begins to heal, it is such a wonderful thing to see. , that's the end of another Friday night.

And I want to develop that tonight because it's important, because the flip side of that is simply saying this, if I want to deal with my codependency and get healthy, I have to learn how to connect with people in healthy ways. And what happens with a child, and if you have complex trauma, one way to understand complex trauma is that when you needed to connect with your parents, you couldn't. And because of that, you felt all alone, you felt abandoned, you felt they didn't care. But you also felt it's your fault, that the reason I can't connect with them is not that there's something wrong with them, but there's got to be something wrong with me. And then you internalize that and say, I must not be lovable or valuable. It's all my fault. And complex trauma and codependency both come from this not connect place as a child. And that leads to how. A child perceives themselves, and that's the shame message that's behind codependency, that I'm not good enough. But then what I want to look at tonight is it begins to shape how you go about trying to connect with people in adult life. And what we're going to look at tonight is the different styles that children develop in order to try and connect, but try to keep themselves safe. At the same time. And as you can imagine, it's solutions that seem to work, but that don't really work. And they create codependent relationships, which end up causing a lot of trouble. lack of connection affects how a child perceives themselves. It affects how they go about relationships. And it affects how they regulate their emotional world. And I'm going to develop that in a sense. I'm going to develop that in a sense. And I'm going to develop that in a sense. And I'm going to develop that in a sense. a minute, but what I want you to just think about tonight is we're going to look at what psychologists have defined as three ways that complex trauma children begin to try and form connections.",

And if mom and dad aren't being freaked out by the events but are calm because they have the tools to deal with it, then the child takes comfort from the fact that mom and dad are regulated. And then they regulate themselves. as they learn from mom and dad and how mom and dad deal with problems and are able to regulate their emotions, it imprints into their nervous system the tools for regulating stress, discomfort, fear, all of those emotions. that when they get to adulthood, they don't need mom and dad to help them regulate anymore. They can regulate themselves. Now if you take somebody from complex trauma, one of the big things that comes out of more severe complex trauma is borderline personality disorder. And what is the key characteristic of that. They can't regulate their emotions once their fear gets triggered. They go from zero to a hundred in a nanosecond. They become irrational. And they don't know how to regulate their emotions. They don't know how to regulate their emotions. they're still at a child's ability when it comes to regulating their emotions. attachment, healthy attachment, leads to regulation of emotions. Such an important thing. What I want you to understand through all of this is if a child doesn't attach, you get the abandonment feeling that happens, which leads to the shame feeling, which leads to problems regulating emotions, which leads to problems with relationships, with conflict, all of that stuff. here's a couple things that have been written. I just wanted to read them to you. Moderately to severely dysregulated nervous systems can lead to addictive behaviors in adulthood. And all of you can relate to that. Then the next one is this. Love or relationship problems. Love or relationship addicts, which is codependency, are chronically dysregulated. In other words, if you want to understand one of the characteristics of a codependent relationship, look for emotional dysregulation. One or both will be dysregulated when they get triggered. And then they trigger each other. And then they just escalate, escalate higher and higher. And then you've got a gong show on your hands.

    "output": "Codependency is all about problems in attaching in childhood. It goes back to that very core thing. you go, how do I know two things. If I had a decent attachment growing up. Or secondly, how do I know that. Secondly, how do I know if I'm attaching to my children. Because I want to form a healthy attachment with my children. there's really four things that disrupt healthy attachment. the technical term is healthy attachment. We call secure attachment. the child feels very secure because they feel safe, loved, accepted, valued, respected. That's secure attachment. They can drop their guard. They don't need any masks. They don't feel they have to walk on eggshells. They can be totally authentic. Unhealthy is insecure attachment. four things that disrupt it. we start with the stages of development in a child. most of you attached to your newborn baby. That infant, you held them. You nursed them. You cooed over them. You spent as much time as possible with them. You kept their life safe. You met all their physical needs. And you worked hard to attach. What I want you to see as we go through this is we're going to look at five different stages of development in a child. For a child to have secure attachment, they need to feel connected in all five stages. If you only connected in one or two stages, but not in all five, then the child will pick up insecure attachment. stage two is toddlerhood as they begin to walk. But what I want you to understand about toddlerhood is all of a sudden this child is a little harder to manage. Because they're into everything and they're exploring and they're curious and they don't really have very good boundaries. they're in their own boundaries on their own. And then you go into the child as they go off to school. Then you go to the preadolescent, 10 to 12. And then the teenage years. And some of you might be sitting there thinking, I attach good in stage one and two. And then after that, it's been downhill. Don't go to beating yourself up. Because what I want you to understand is that you can always repair insecure attachment. If your child begins to feel that you're getting healthy and you're becoming safe, they still want to attach to you.",

    "input": "How does attachment impact a person's life, and what are the steps to healing?",
    "output": "And you can repair a lot of the damage. But that's the first way that healthy attachment can be interrupted. Secondly is inconsistent parenting. let me just say this. I get a lot of clients, addicts, who come to me and say, I'm a really good parent. And what they mean and what I point out to them is that when you're clean and sober, you're a good parent. The problem is you're not always clean and sober. to your child, they love it when you're clean and sober. But when you're relapsed and back in the problem, there's no connection with you at all. inconsistent parents results in insecure attachment. Third one, if you were uncomfortable about some topic because of your own issues, and you therefore wouldn't let your child talk to you about what they were struggling with, you shut them down, then they felt all alone. And they felt the connection with you break a little bit. everything that they have inside of them that they know they can't talk to you about, either because you'll go crazy or you'll get angry or you'll judge them, that breaks the attachment. And then the fourth is when mom and dad split. That disrupts the attachment. Now I just want to add, if you are working on yourself, and you are separated, yes there's damage that's been done, but if you're working on yourself, a child that can attach to one parent is a wonderful thing. It's way better than a child that can't attach to either parent. And again, attachment with your child isn't about gimmicks that you do to try to get them to talk to you. Attachment with your child is about you becoming healthy and safe. And your child already wants to attach to you. They're just waiting for you to become a person they can safely attach to. let me go into the three types of insecure attachment. And what these are, are the three different ways a child learns to cope with lack of attachment. And that then comes into their adult life and it shows up in codependency. some of these you're going to understand from some of the stuff we've already talked about. But the first one is anxious attachment.",

But before we get there, I want to give you the third type, and that's what we call disorganized attachment. Disorganized attachment. That's a child who grows up in abuse and they can't find a solution to get out of abuse. And one day, they are reaching out to mom and dad for help. The next day they're running away from mom and dad. They're trying all kinds of different things because nothing's working. And there's no real patterns. It's very disorganized. But what comes core of their being, is this huge, huge fear of intimacy. Because intimacy leads to conflict. Conflict leads to abandonment. And there's constant fear in relationships. And they will often give very mixed messages when they get into a relationship in adult life that comes out of that disorganized mind. one day they'll say, I love you. Next day, go away. One day, I need you. Next day, I don't need you. And you're sitting there going, what in the world am I supposed to do with this. And it gets very confusing for the other person. Now let me just add this. You can take all three of those things, those attachment styles, and you can go to the average person with complex trauma as they go to work, as they have casual friends, and you won't necessarily see those three things. When you begin to see their attachment style is when they get into an intimate relationship. And then all of a sudden, that deep fear, shame, abandonment, all begins to surface, and their style is affected because of that. , let's go to this. The anxious person, the anxious style, is attracted to the avoidant style. I just find that very humorous at times as I watch it. let me give it to you this way. The anxious one we're going to call the pursuer. The avoidant one is the distancer. what you have is a pursuer chasing a person around, saying, please connect with me, and they say, please stay away from me. And quit crowding my space. Now, what I want you to understand is, they're not even aware they're doing it because it happens at a subconscious level.",

I was trying to get love from unsafe people. And that's where I based all of my equations about relationships and love was with unsafe people. I have to now realize that even though that seemed the truth, it was actually a lie when it comes to love.

Because you're treating yourself as if you matter. You're treating yourself with respect. And that is a form of validation. And then when you require others to treat you with respect or else I'm not going to have a relationship with you, you're actually validating yourself, not verbally, but through your actions. And that to me is a lot of people when they think of validation, just think of it as a verbal process, but actually it's more an activity, action process. In the initial stages, because what I find for a lot of people, they early, 30 years ago in therapy, it was look in the mirror and tell yourself how wonderful you are. Tell yours validate and tell yourself. And I would ask clients, how many of you have done that. And they'd all put their hands up and I go, how many of did that work. And they, most of them, nope, you're doing verbal validation, but you're not backing it up with action validation, standing up for yourself, saying, treat me with respect, or I'm not having a relationship with you. That's where the validation has to begin.",

But if our act, but if we don't do the actions, then the words mean nothing. it's the same thing with ourself. I mean, the way we look at it is we build a relationship with ourself we want, we do with others. Exactly. And what I say to clients all the time is sadly, what happens in complex trauma is words carry less and less meaning and weight because parents say, I love you. I love you, but they never back it up with actions. And you begin to mistrust words that words, they're suspect, prove it to me by your actions. , otherwise I just feel I'm not doing it.

That's validation. , and somebody wants to connect with us that's validation, but that is kind of,.",

    "output": "Now, this is the one I get people that get upset with me at times because they say sex is not a need. Here's how I respond. Sex is the one thing we could live without. Sex is the one thing we could live without. If we had other needs, we could live without sex. that's why some people say it's not a need. But sex is a drive. It is built into us. It is a powerful drive. And what I want people to understand, especially coming out of complex trauma, is if they don't understand the power of their sex drive, then they're probably going to have trouble in recovery. And sex, maybe you could live without, but yet it is an important part of life in understanding ourselves. It is a powerful drive. That's why I emphasize it. With that is family. Now, some people will say, I don't have the need to have children. And I go, true. It's another thing that can be lived without. We don't necessarily need to have kids to be fulfilled. But it is a drive. It is a drive for most people. Something in them wants children. Something in them drives them to pursue having a family. sex and family might not necessarily be needs for people, but they are powerful drives for most. And it is important to understand them. Then we look at the fact that we are relational beings. We have relational needs and relational drives. A child wants a friend. A child wants to fit in. And under relationship are a whole bunch, 11 sub needs. And these are important because in complex trauma, most people got their physical needs met, though some didn't. Where the trauma comes in is in this relational need and the next one we're going to look at. the sub needs are we have a power, a powerful need for attachment. It is one of our most important needs. And that's not just to attach to mom, dad, other human beings, but it's to attach to ourselves, to attach to a higher power. Attachment is central to -being, to feeling happiness. Then we have a need to be able to be authentic.",

We need communication. That is essential as part of a healthy life. We need relationships. But we need to be able to trust the people we are in relationship with. Trust becomes a need. And in order to be able to trust, we need people to be committed to us. having a few people who are committed to us is a need if we are to be healthy.

The neglect stuff. The stuff that seems invisible. It's that their needs weren't met. Mainly their emotional needs. And it was huge light bulbs. Then it helped them to understand how they got into addiction. They were trying to solve the pain that they couldn't resolve in their life. And it was. It was a way for them to understand that they couldn't resolve any other way. And then it showed them the path forward in recovery. That recovery isn't just a magic fix. A simple little wee solution. Where you do step one, do three. And everything is good. It's learning to meet your 12 needs. I just saw tremendous positive impact. And as I taught it over the years. I saw clients with just light bulbs happening every time I taught it. Huge insights into why they did what they did. What they needed to change. I saw tears as people finally began to acknowledge the unmet needs. And how painful that was. And then I saw people beginning to understand what recovery was really all about. Learning to meet your 12 needs. we've taken all that I've done over the years in workshops. And now we're offering it in a self study course. It's not a workshop that I'm going to be teaching. It's just the content from all of those years. Of teaching it. That we now want to make available to you in a self study way. And the reason we're offering at a cheap price. Is because what I've seen over the years. Is that teaching has become the foundation. Of all that we teach about trauma and recovery. It's the starting point for many people.

    "output": "when a person wants to deal with procrastination, they really have to deal with three things. They have to overcome the inertia of just being in that place for long. They have to break the habit, and then they have to heal the underlying issues. People procrastinate because their drive or impulse to delay is irrationally stronger than their drive to act. there's something in the brain that puts instant gratification ahead of what is healthy. That's procrastination. in the context of complex trauma, procrastination is part of the flight response. It's the way we deal with danger or stress by way of trying to avoid or escape. That's what procrastination is about. in adult life, as our body starts to, the brain is perceiving extra stress, the brain tends to go to procrastination. I want to avoid. I want to numb. I want to escape this somehow because I don't think I can handle this extra stress. it's very much part of complex trauma of the flight response. Let me just give you a couple examples. I remember in university I had a roommate who left every assignment, every assignment to the very last night. He left studying for exams to the very last night. He would set out weeks ahead to begin working on assignments, to begin studying for exams, but would just always find excuses for not doing it that day. Put it off, put it off to the very last night, then he'd pull an all-nighter. I've had people who they've got letters from the government around their taxes, around outstanding bills, and they just can't open up. They can't open those letters because something in them prevents it. they put it off, they put it in a drawer, they leave it, they leave it, planning to open it one day, but not quite ever getting around to it. I've had clients who they've got years of taxes that they, income tax that they have not filed with the government. They just somehow can't get around to filling out their income tax at the beginning of the year. And it's just a huge issue. For them, they hate themselves for it. It's causing all kinds of problems in their life, but they can't get there. I've had people who were going bankrupt. Their job was not working. Their business was falling apart.",

They're not relaxing properly and getting into their parasympathetic nervous system. And , when it comes to think about doing a new job that they should do, they go, I just can't. I'm too tired. That's legitimate, but it causes them to procrastinate. , that place of being overwhelmed and exhausted that they live in causes them to just put off, as long as they can, doing jobs. Another thing that comes out of complex trauma, is the distractions become addictions. , it can be food, TV, drugs, alcohol, gambling, sex, whatever. But what begins to happen is when you're faced with a job that needs to be done, your brain goes, I'd rather do my addiction. It delivers instant gratification. It takes me out of all this stress for a while and the addiction continually wins out. Another thing that comes out of complex trauma is depression. The brain just, life sucks or the brain says, we're going to go to the parasympathetic, whether you it or not. We're not going to continue in this sympathetic nervous system. And , we're going to start shutting down. And that will include depression. , what does depression do. It takes away all motivation. I don't feel doing anything. Nothing gives me pleasure. And , people just start procrastinating. And , we're going to start procrastinating because of that depression. Then we talked about the rebellion one. , procrastination for a child was a way to rebel against controlling parents, authoritarian parents, who never heard them, who never listened to them, who never tried to understand them, who just demanded everything be their way. And , the child procrastinated as a subtle way of rebelling. Another thing that can begin to happen because of all the shame and the guilt that comes out of complex trauma is that people begin to believe they don't deserve a good life. And , procrastination is actually a way of subtly sabotaging themselves. , I should get this job done. I could get this job done. This job will lead to greater success, to greater health, to a good job, to better relationships.

The behaviors before the event that fall dominoes. you could have, let's say somebody really pisses you off. And all of a sudden your anger goes where your anger goes. Then the dominoes start falling. next you could go and you could become super negative, criticize everything, find fault with everything. Then you have self-pity. You go on the pity pot and have a little party. Then you start to isolate. And then you start to lie. And then you start hanging around with old friends or checking them out on Facebook. And then you pick up. it didn't just happen in a day. It was a process. And what you begin to realize is I'm not just changing using to not using. I'm changing lying to being honest. Isolating to meaningful relationships. Negative thinking to beginning to look at life accurately. I have to change all kinds of behavior. that's another major overhaul for a lot of people. Because if you spent your life in survival mode from complex trauma, that means you spent your life lying in order to survive. You spent your life unknowingly. You spent your life isolating in order to survive. But now those very things that kept you safe from the trauma as a younger person, now those very things are leading you to a relapse. And you begin to realize I got to start changing from my old survival behaviors to new skills. I got to learn new tools which include new behaviors. And that is absolutely necessary in recovery. then the next layer is you got to start changing your thinking. I don't know if you ever thought about how much your brain affects whether you stay clean and sober or get healthy or not. a lot of things that you have in your brain that you might not even realize is you tell yourself lies all the time.

And I started going back in my mind to this book in the that's around the middle of the called Nehemiah. It's not one that gets read very often because there's lots parts of it that are super boring, really boring. But, a while back, I was thinking about Nehemiah's story that is told and I thought, this is the perfect parallel to recovery. what I'm going to do over the next few weeks is tell you about Nehemiah and kind of how his story parallels recovery. And I hope you're going to find it very instructive but encouraging as. And just give you insight into your own troubles, your own struggles. Nehemiah lived 2,500 years ago and he lived around Jerusalem and his hometown was the city of Jerusalem in Israel. But he wasn't living there at the beginning of the story. He had been taken, captivity, and what had happened is the nation that conquered Israel had demolished the city. And Nehemiah is the guy that came along, and started to rebuild the city and he started by rebuilding the walls. What the parallel is, is that if you look at recovery, it's much what Nehemiah looked at. He looked at a whole bunch of rubble. Your life has come to rubble. Everything has crumbled and fallen apart. And a lot of people at the beginning of recovery stand and look at all of the rubble of their life, and they go, where do I begin. This is a big, big job. your relationships lie in ruin, your job lies in ruin, your finances are in ruin, your health is in ruin. Just about everything is in ruin. And recovery is all about rebuilding. But you're rebuilding from a pile of rubble. And that's what we're going to be looking at with Nehemiah because it gives us a very detailed, involved explanation of the problems that he encountered. And every problem that he encountered, we will encounter in recovery. He's going to go through days where he gets external opposition. He's going to go through days where his closest friends start to complain and become negative about him. He's going through days where he's very discouraged, days where he's struggling, days where he's stressed, days where he's tired and overwhelmed.",

But I want to begin by giving you a little background about Israel. Because Israel is a wonderful parallel to an addict in addiction. what Israel had done over the last thousand years of their existence is they got close to and then they thought, what, the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. We think we'd be happier drifting away from , doing our own thing. they drifted away and every time they encountered pain, negative painful consequences for bad decisions. And they would stay in the house, they would stay in those bad decisions until the pain got bad, they go running back to. And then they go along with for a while and they say, what, grass is greener and they drift away and do the same thing over and over again. Sounds many people in recovery. They do , things are going great and then they start slacking off, drifting, and before it, relapse and they stay there until the pain is great they come back. And they have this cycle, Israel did, of drifting, pain, coming back, repeat, repeat. And what happened eventually, Israel got to a point where it didn't want to come back. They figured, what's the point. We're too far gone. And at that point in time, this nation came in and conquered them because they're the weakest they'd ever been. Life looked the most hopeless that it had ever been because they were carried away as captives and slaves to a foreign country and it was a painful, desperate, hopeless-looking time of their existence. And that's where we find Nehemiah. their time away in this foreign country as prisoners was a 70-year period. And Nehemiah lived in that period and near the end of that period, his brother comes to visit him. And his brother has been down in Jerusalem. He's gone back to Israel to check it out. And Nehemiah says to his brother, tell me what is going on back in Israel. And this is what it says. My brother came to visit me. He had just arrived from Judah, which is Israel.",

    "output": ", welcome to another Friday night. We've gone through this series of understanding trauma and it always leads to this such an important question of, you've diagnosed it, you've explained it, you've helped us see how it's messed us up big time, but how do we heal from it. And that's what I want to focus on this time and next. A lot of it we've covered already with each of the talks. We've talked about different healing pieces to it, but I just want to pull it all together today and give you an overview of the healing from trauma. And I hope it's helpful. I hope it points the way forward for you. Let me begin by just reading some quotes. it says to not deal with trauma is to be at work. It says to not deal with trauma is to be a war with yourself. To hide deep pain takes an enormous amount of energy. But I love that because what it's saying is if you don't deal with your trauma, you might think, oh, it's not going to bother me. , you're going to be at war with yourself. It is going to affect you and it takes a lot of energy to suppress all of that stuff. Peter Levine has written, a life sentence. And I think that's important to hear. He's also said trauma must be regarded as a virus that can still be triggered years later. And when it's triggered, it produces unhealthy responses if we don't heal from it. And to me, people can avoid the healing journey. People can try to find shortcuts that don't work. But eventually, you have to face the fact I need to heal. This is going to take some work, but I got to go there. And that's where I hope you are at. What I think is important to say up front is this. The trauma healing journey is different from the current medical model of healing. And I think it's important to understand this because this really messes people up. They go into trauma thinking that they're going to heal in the same way that they were healed in the same way that they were healed in the same way that they were healed in the same way that they were healed in the same way they were healed.",

And I think it's I'm same way they would heal with the medical model what is the current medical model you feel a sore throat or you get a cut or you have something wrong with your kidneys you go to the doctor you get diagnosed and then they basically they give you surgery a medication or therapy and basically say we're going to do these steps and it's kind of these basic steps that they're going to do and it's a linear approach to do step one step two step three and it follows a straight line and you see constant improvement and it's a fairly short one that within six to 12 weeks you're going to be feeling a whole lot better or the problem is going to be gone and that's the current medical model that is not how complex trauma works and many people do that and it's a very complex model and this is a very complex model and it's a very complex model and it's a very complex model and people get disappointed when they're not expecting that and then they get disappointed when it doesn't happen that way and they think either it's a bad program or i'm doing something wrong and no it's the model for healing trauma is totally different and there's three phases to the trauma recovery model number one in an environment of safety. And the first thing that I need to do when I'm working with a client is to provide safety for them. That means I have to be a safe person and I need to provide a safe environment. Now for people coming out of trauma, that's going to take a while before they feel safe sometimes. And that could be several weeks or months before they start to feel safe. Secondly, once they feel safe, then you go to reprocessing the trauma. And we're going to come back to that. And then thirdly, once they've reprocessed the trauma and healed from it, then they can move on with life. But here's where it gets tricky. let's go back to the safety. safety includes they've got to get stabilized that they're able to regulate themselves when they get triggered.",

    "output": "They start to grow and it's looking great and they're doing really , but where they really fall apart, where the damage gets done is when they get triggered. And then all of a sudden they go to their limbic brain. They're lashing out. Their emotions are dysregulated. That's when they hurt their kids. That's when they hurt their loved ones. That's when they make bad decisions. And if they don't learn practical tools to manage and regulate their emotions at those times when they're triggered, they'll just keep doing damage. That is hard to learn the tools to manage emotions when you're triggered. And it's a key but difficult part of this journey for people. The next thing I want people to realize when they enter into this recovery journey and begin to heal is that you're really going to be healing on two different levels. The first level is you're going to be going back to your past and looking at those wounds that started all of the problems for you that you weren't able to resolve as a child and heal from. And the healing is going to take place there. And that's going to be quite intense in the initial part of the journey, but that's definitely going to be a big part of the initial part of the journey. But there's a second level and that is you still have daily life going on. You're still dealing with problems at home, with children, with partner, with friends, with family, with work. And there's stresses, there's conflict, there's different things that come up that you just don't have the tools to handle. And it's the very practical, healthy living tools that you never learned as a child, but now you need to learn in order to deal with life in a healthy way. And that's the second level. And the third level is you're going to be going back to your past and looking at those wounds that you weren't able to resolve as a child, and not go back to some of the old tools. And that's such an important part of learning too. And a lot of people that offer programs for people with trauma often just focus on the second part and say, oh, we're just going to teach you the tools to live a healthy life.",

They can't stop themselves and they do all kinds of damage. Others just say, I'm going to go back to my past and look at the tools that I learned in my life. And that's just focus on the healing part and they don't give you the practical tools. That doesn't work as it should either. And you need both levels of healing in order to have complete healing take place. Over the years, what I've begun to realize is people kind of make common mistakes when it comes to recovery. They have expectations about the healing journey that aren't necessarily realistic. probably the most common one is that people, without even realizing it, come into recovery wanting a magic fix or a quick fix. They want you to just go through this course and know within two, three months they'll be all better. That is not realistic. Or they want recovery that bypasses having to deal with any painful emotions. Just give me information. I don't want to have to deal with that painful emotional stuff. Emotions are bad. I don't emotions. I just facts. And they want something that's just academic only. They want to bypass dealing with emotions. The next one that is common for people is they do, without realizing it, kind of have this expectation that recovery should be done in a way that is not realistic. to be done within a few months, at most a year. it's a completion date in their mind as to when recovery will be over. And they go into this. And after a year they realize they're still struggling with stuff and they start only scratching the surface on some things and they just begin to get discouraged. Realize this is a long, long journey. You're going to see a lot of growth in the first year.",

But it is going to require some long, it's going to require some cleaning out, some pain, and then a long healing process. One final illustration. important. And this is often for people who are helping somebody who has trauma. And they're a friend or a coach or a therapist. Babette Rothschild compares a person with trauma to kind of a two-litre Coke bottle that you shake. And the whole thing is that trauma inside the nervous system is building pressure. Because it isn't being resolved. And you're just adding more and more stresses to it. And it's shaking a Coke bottle. And now often when a person comes into therapy, what begins to happen is they want to screw the lid off that Coke bottle and just release all this pressure. But that could be actually dangerous for them. That would be an explosion. And the friend and the therapist, they sometimes just have to unscrew the cap a little bit. Let a little bit of pressure out and say, that's enough for today. We're going to come back to that tomorrow or next week. And we'll take off the cap again for a little bit. And you have to very slowly release the pressure is the point. Because to release it all at once would actually do a whole lot of damage. Now let me go to a big picture of this healing journey. I think the simplest way to say what is the healing recovery. Journey from trauma is basically saying it's the process of learning to meet all 12 of my needs. That means I have to learn how to parent myself and learn how to meet all 12 of my needs. That is really what we're doing. Because what caused the trauma. Not having my needs met and not knowing how to meet those needs. And it created trauma. And this whole process.",

The things that demotivate me. that I can keep doing things not just that meet my needs, but things that keep me motivated. All of that is self-awareness. All of that is essential. let me go to skills that are important to learn. And this, if you're going to make this journey successfully. number one, pace yourself. many people that come out of complex trauma end up in addiction. Or they end up that their whole approach to life is you do everything 110 with great intensity. And they come into recovery and it's all about I'm just going to pour my life into this 110. And they burn themselves out in recovery. And after a couple of months they go, I'm exhausted. I can't do this anymore. And they quit. you have to pace yourself. You have to be willing to say, I can't do it all today. I can only do much today. That's going to have to be. I have to go slow. Self-care is important. You can't keep running a car when the gas tank is empty. You have to keep finding ways to fill the tank. You can't do recovery. You have to do recovery as a sprint. It's a marathon. Pace yourself. That is , important. Secondly, self-compassion. The old response that came out of complex trauma on how to treat yourself was a shame response where you beat yourself up. You're hard on yourself. You punish yourself. You tear yourself down. You have an inner critic that is very big. That does not work to produce lasting change. That just sends you into unhealthy behaviors. self-compassion has three elements. Number one, self-kindness, being warm and understanding towards your suffering as a child because that child wasn't trying to be bad. That child was just trying to survive in very unjust situations. It's also being warm and understanding towards our failures because we are going to fail. there's no value in beating yourself up from it.",

And now your growth is really coming from a different point. It's coming from triggering. , that's not a fun part of growing. It's growing every time you get a new pain in your life. It's not as fun as just sitting in a classroom and learning. And realize that the growth is continuing, but it just is different and it often doesn't feel as good. There's another part in this recovery journey that's important to be aware of. And that is the default setting. And that's that subconsciousness. That's that subconsciousness. That's that subconscious programming that we just go back to without even realizing it. When our subconscious brain, which works over 90 of the time in our decision-making processes. And we use the illustration of learning to ride a new bike that steers the exact opposite of the old bike. when you turn the handlebars left, you go. the concept within a millisecond that, oh,. I just changed the way I turn the handlebars and then I'll steer the bike differently. But to actually implement that when you've got years and years of riding a bike the old way. And that's now part of your subconscious programming. You can ride a bike and talk to people and look around and you just ride it. It's subconscious. To change that takes months, even years to become good at doing that. Where that new program becomes your subconscious. what I think is important to understand is there's something in us that just naturally gravitates back to old default settings. And for some that's shame. Some it's anger. Some it's guilt. Some it's anxiety. Some it's depression. They just need to be in those places to feel normal. And we need to understand that default setting that we naturally gravitate towards. And to do that we need those mindfulness tools where I stop several times a day and do an inventory just to see where I'm at. The other piece to me in this recovery journey to be aware of is I need to develop tools to connect with myself. With my emotions. we said is trauma is basically disconnection. I can't resolve anything. And I can't connect to people.",

That you've never been stretched before. To the breaking point. This recovery journey is going to include times of failure. You're not going to do everything perfectly.

Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. Where you move your eyes from side to side. Guided by a therapist who is trained. This has got all kinds of scientific proof that it is very effective. And many have found it very helpful for them in reprocessing their trauma. Then there is EFT or Emotion Freedom Techniques. Which is known sometimes as tapping. you tap different pressure points. And it helps release some of the trauma from the brain. From your body. Then another modality of therapy is Internal Family Systems. Developed by Dr. Richard Schwartz. We use it. It has got tremendous benefits for people. Inner child work. Psychoanalysis. Gestalt Therapy. Brain Spotting. Now one of the questions I get asked about more and more.

Number one. Do not go into psychedelics. Unless you have an experienced. Reliable guide. Because they can take you to places that are quite dark. And if you don't have a guide to help you. It can be too much. we need that. Number one. Number two. What I have found for many people that have used psychedelics. Is they have got. They have seen instant benefits. But. If they don't deal with their deep core issues of shame. Of fear of abandonment. They just leave those. Unlooked at. Those benefits they receive from psychedelics. Within a few months. They begin to disappear. Because their deep core issues take over. And if you are going to deal. Do with. New psychedelics. Don't see them as a magic fix. Don't see them as a. Bypass to dealing with painful stuff. You still have to deal with that deep core stuff. they can be helpful in dealing with that.

You have a deep fear that you will remain unloved and unseen if you don't do these behaviors. You are driven, a workaholic.

I've got to meet this standard. And those standards are often unrealistic. those are the characteristics. I don't know how you see yourself after going through that. You might for the first time begin to realize, I've got some issues here. where do they come from. What is this about. instead of beating yourself up and saying, oh, I've got to stop this approval seeking or attention seeking, why do I do that. Where does this come from. kind of three big things that come out of complex trauma. number one, it's parents that weren't attuned to the child's emotional needs. And your emotional needs were not seen and therefore met. secondly, that's another way of saying you experience something, some type of neglect. You did not receive the attention you should have from your parents. And it could be they were workaholics. It could be they were narcissists. It could be they were very insecure driven. Or it could be, not that they did it intentionally, but you were in a very large family. Or they had their own family business and it demanded all of their time. Or they had chronic health problems or mental health problems. And they just weren't able to be there for you. Another part of this is every child needs validation. That's one of our emotional needs. They need to be told, you're good at that. Hey, you are this way. You did a great job there. That's how a child learns who they are. That's how a child begins to get a good positive self-identity. But some parents grew up in an era where they were told that if you validated your children they would get a big head. They would become proud. They would get a big ego.

    "output": "But it had the reverse effect. It created shame. based on inaccurate teaching, parents often did not validate their children sufficiently. what happens for a child whose need for validation is not met in a consistent way is they can go in one of two directions. they can suppress the need for validation. basically that means suppress all of my needs. Because if I express my needs and I should get validation but rather I get rejection, I get punishment, in other words I get pain, therefore let's become invisible. Let's not need validation. Let's not have needs. Let's make no demands. children this often become invisible children. They develop a rich fantasy world. They become a loner. They become self-sufficient. That's what they need to do to not go through the pain of not being validated. Now the challenge, if I can give as an aside, for many invisible children when they come into recovery is that when they begin to realize I need to make myself visible. I need to put my needs out there. I need to express my desires. I need to try things and do things. All of a sudden they feel guilty. All of a sudden fear kicks in. I'm going to get rejected. I'm going to get judged. I'm going to get punished. And for them to come out of invisibility into healthy expression of needs creates tremendous fear. It is a very difficult thing and they often feel guilty doing that. just be aware of that. But the second thing that can happen when a child is not validated is that they then go to developing a hyper need for validation, a hyper need for approval, a hyper need for recognition. It becomes this black hole that can never be satisfied an itch that just can't be scratched sufficiently. with attention seeking, this is important to understand. A child that is neglected, they will do things to gain attention. They will make attention seeking behaviors. It's not to be bad. It's because they want to connect. It's a bid for connection. It's please notice me that you will connect with me. it's driven by this huge need for connection that every child has. But if the parents don't connect and then judge the child for the attention seeking behavior, the child begins to go, I'm bad.",

And then what comes out of that is, but I still want to be seen. I still want to be noticed. I don't care if it's in a good way anymore. I just want to be seen. Hopefully people will connect. But if they don't, oh , I just need to be seen. now attention seeking behavior can go into very many maladaptive forms. Just wanting to be noticed. And for some kids it can develop into almost rebellion. I am going to go to maladaptive attention seeking things because I know my parents get mad at me for that. And that's going to pay them off. And that's going to pay them back for not giving me healthy attention. the attention seeking is a hyper need because of lack of validation, healthy validation. The approval seeking, if you look at the shame that has developed, that I must not be good enough. And the child then doesn't have any positive feelings towards himself. But they want to be loved. They want to be approved. They want to feel good. they can't give that to themselves. they go looking to please others. To gain others approval as a solution to their shame. that is where this comes from. Now let me just show you some of the other things that parents can do that create this attention approval seeking life trap. many parents will place kind of in a shame type of culture. They place tons of importance on what other people think of them. they're always concerned with outward appearances or keeping up appearances. you got to act a certain way, dress a certain way, talk a certain way, have certain manners, do certain things in public in order to gain the approval of others. It's all about being approved by others. a child growing up, when they want to dress the way that suits them, that is comfortable to them, when they want to engage in certain hobbies or sports or activities, the parents are going, but is that going to be approved by the culture, the people I know in my culture. If not, no, you can't wear that. No, you can't have that activity.",

It's guided by keeping up appearances, getting the approval of the culture. And that then is a parent who can have this life trap themself. That their life is all based on gaining approval, their life is all about image. It's all about status. It's all about success. It's all about material possessions. It's all about money. It's all about externals. That is the guiding factor in their parent's life. And the child then is brought into that world and tried to get squeezed into that mold. Another thing that can happen is that children grow up where parents only validate them when they do what the parents want, when they please the parents. And if their parents are narcissists, if their parents are all about image and externals, they're going to get validation for being pretty. They're going to get validation for being the smartest kid in the class, the best athlete. They're not going to get validated for what really matters in life. They're only going to get validated for what fits the parent's value system, what the parents deem as the marks of success. Other children, if they grew up with abuse, if they grew up with bullying, if they grew up with abandonment, if they grew up with a child who was a victim of abuse, if they grew up with abuse, they're going to get shame through those avenues. And then what happens with shame. I need others to approve me. I need others to see me. And mainly neglect can bring it, but abuse and abandonment can also bring this about because it produces the same shame issue. Another thing that can happen for many children is they might have got the predominant thing they got from their parents was criticism, judgment. They were always finding fault with everything they did. Nothing they did was ever good enough. And the child was just driven to try to get approval, to be desperate for approval. Another one is if you had a parent who was a narcissist. They were living this life trap out in their own life. And that was your role model. That was your normal.

They're kind of a pretty doll on a shelf that everybody just admires. Everybody just sees them a certain way. They see them based on their physical, their physical behaviors and their physical appearance. Nobody actually sees the real them for who they really are. They only see the externals and then assume that this is who they are. But it's actually, they see them through a fantasy lens of who they want them to be. And many children kind of get put in that perfect doll role. You got to look a certain way, act a certain way, and be this way because then we will admire you. Then we will. And they act they see you all the time because they give you much attention, but they don't really see you. They see you through a fantasy lens, who they want you to be. Some children are given by their parents roles. in complex trauma, we talk about children developing roles to try to not get hurt, to try to get their needs met, to try to fix the family. But sometimes in complex trauma, children are assigned roles without even being told they're assigned roles. They just gradually pick up that they're expected to live a certain way. some are expected to be the hero, but some children are assigned the role or expected to be invisible. That you're going to be the child that never makes demands. You're going to be the child that's going to be the flower on the wall. That's just there, pretty, no demands, invisible. And many children have grown up feeling that subtle constant expectation that they're never to draw attention to themselves, never to express needs, never to make demands, never be a burden. That's just what was passed on to them. Others, they had a sibling who was put into the hero role. Or the comedian role. And they got tons of validation from everybody for being such a wonderful child, for being funny. But you weren't assigned the comedian role or the hero role. you didn't get any validation.",

They then made this commitment. I am going to be a pro. I am going to be the best at this. I am going to put all my attention into developing this ability. Because in their mind, that's the only place their value came from. And they were going to get it to have maximum value. And that became their obsession. what I want you to see is that all of these things, can you see the shame component. All of the stuff that came out of neglect, not being validated, produced shame. Now all the other things that the parents did produced shame. shame is the underlying element here. And approval seeking, attention seeking, is all driven by shame. It's all trying to solve shame. But it doesn't work. shame is this underlying issue. instead of it working to solve shame, instead of it working to get positive validation, to get positive admiration, it begins to have the opposite effect. we talked about, you begin to not know who you are. Because you're trying to please everybody else and be what they want. you lose your sense of identity. You don't even know what your needs are, what your thoughts are, your feelings are after a while. Then you're not able to truly connect with people because true connection requires authenticity. And you don't know what that is. And you begin to realize that your relationships are all rather superficial. Then people start to think, they start getting tired of you always wanting approval or seeking attention. And they stop giving it to you. They set boundaries. They end the relationship because you're wearing them out.",

This is my talents. I my talents. I'm good at this. You learn to validate yourself. I don't need everybody to be my sources of validation. Though I'm still going to have some healthy people validate me. I'm going to learn to meet this need for myself. I'm going to parent myself and learn to validate myself. That's not pride. That's not having a big ego. No, that's humility. See yourself. See yourself. See yourself. Humility. Seeing myself accurately. Meeting this need of validation in a healthy way for myself is significant. realize with that what you're doing is retraining your validation need. Because you were made to feel that lack of validation is humility. Lack of validation is virtue. Lack of validation is healthy. But it's not. It leads to shame. How can that be healthy. But to retrain that to healthy validation it's going to make you feel guilty. It's going to make you feel that you're being proud. But you have to learn to get through that transition until the healthy begins to feel normal. And you don't feel guilty for it. learn to do that. Don't go from excessive validation, pendulum swing, swing tide, I shouldn't need any validation. No. Everybody needs validation. You just have to figure out what that looks for you. Retrain yourself as to when do I slide into unhealthy validation. What is healthy validation. Begin to understand that. And that's going to take some time but it is important. Then if you're in a social setting with other people and all of a sudden you feel the impulse to do something to get attention, to get approval, stop yourself. Don't give in to it. Don't feed it.

    "output": "The next issue that comes out of complex trauma is pretty everybody coming out of complex trauma has boundary issues. there's two parts to boundaries. There are boundaries that basically define what love looks. a boundary is a rule that says we're not going to lie. We're not going to cheat. We're not going to hit others. We're not going to steal from others. We're not going to say unkind, hateful words. Those are all boundaries that define what love looks. Because you're trying to keep life healthy and keep relationships healthy. The other part of boundaries is how close do I let you into my life. Am I responsible for your needs and problems or not. Am I responsible for some but only to a degree. You're responsible for most of it. How enmeshed am I. How distant am I. How close do I let pushy people into my life. Can I say no to them. Can I demand privacy. Can I cut people out of my life. Boundaries are all about managing relationships and the closeness of relationships and how relationships operate. People coming out of complex trauma, they didn't have either set of boundaries modeled for them very. There was lots of unfair, unloving, lots of hurtful words all the time. There was lots of violation of involvement in people. There was lots of violation of involvement in people. There was lots of violation of involvement in people's lives. people coming out of complex trauma, some didn't have any boundaries at all. Do whatever you want. Others had super rigid boundaries. Tons and tons and tons of rules that there was no bends, no bend, there was no exceptions. Others, boundaries weren't about what was best for everybody in the family. Boundaries were only about what was best for the person in authority, what they liked. often the boundaries were unfair for everybody else. The boundaries weren't about love. The boundaries actually hurt other people. The boundaries actually restricted people from getting, having fun, having their needs met. And to the child, boundaries in that environment were bad things. Boundaries made life worse, more painful. And then for some children in complex trauma, boundaries were inconsistent. One day this was the rule, the next day that rule didn't apply, it depended on the parent's mood. For others, boundaries were just a rule.",

Depended on the parent's mood. And then for others, some days there, if you broke the rule, the consequence was over the top. You were grounded for a month. You had all kinds of privileges taken away. It was cruel. consequences didn't match the crime. Then for others, the family was enmeshed. You were responsible for everybody else's emotions, everybody else's behavior. You weren't allowed privacy. You weren't allowed to have a natural bubble that said, I don't want you into my space. You didn't know where you ended and where somebody else's began because you were intertwined. Some families said we're close as a family because we do everything together. But that was actually enmeshment. That wasn't healthy. Or some families, nobody was involved in anybody's life. Everybody just lived solo existence. Everybody doing their own thing. You did not know how to interact and help each other meet each other's needs. then many children, because all children have a natural sense of a bubble, if somebody got involved, they would be in trouble. If somebody got into their bubble without permission, they would respond and say, no, that's my space. That's my room. The door is shut. Stay out. Demand privacy. They would then get punished for that. peace in the family was only maintained not by healthy boundaries. Peace was maintained by conforming to unhealthy boundaries. That's what they knew. to be a healthy family, you had to be a healthy family. To be a good child meant you had to do what dad wanted. Even if it wasn't for your best, even if it wasn't that everybody's needs mattered the same amount, conforming to the boundaries of the authority was all that mattered. boundary issues, and we do a whole week in our program on boundaries because this is such an important topic and difficult to get all the nuances of boundaries. many people from complex trauma struggle with procrastination. They delay or they put off doing tasks until the last minute or past their deadline, even though they know it's going to lead to even more painful consequences down the road. They'd rather have instant relief of the stress than worry about the long-term consequences.",

I want to go to kind of four major ways that the sexual drive can get distorted or twisted. the obvious one is sexual abuse that does much damage in a child that distorts sexuality sometimes. And this is hard to say, but important to say sometimes almost irreparably. I have worked for many years in counseling people with sexual abuse. And sadly, what I've seen with. Some is that they may never heal to the point of being able to engage in a healthy, intimate sexual relationship. There's just too much damage been done. Too many things get triggered today as soon as they go to engage in sex. It's just sad. Others, they may finally eventually get to a more healthy sexual place and be able to have a healthy sexual. Relationship with somebody. But it could take years to get there. And great patience is required. Tons of work is required. There's not a magic fix to just make it go away. The second thing is neglect. And most have never really considered that before. The third thing is to grow up in a family where one of your parents has unresolved issues around sex. anything that is sexual in the child, the parent overreacts to and that can do tremendous damage and really distort the sexual drive of the child. The fourth thing is parents or growing up in an environment that has very repressive teaching around sexuality, almost puritanical. some of you have grown up where it's been taught or you just pick up that sexual desires, having sexual desires that you're bad, that you're doing something wrong, that's a terrible thing to have sexual desires. Then some of you have heard kind of sex is dirty. It's an obligation. It's a necessity to have kids, but it's kind of a dirty thing. Some of you have grown up where it's the job of women to make men happy.",

And we call it shame. instead of seeing yourself as valuable and a loving, valuable person, you see yourself as not valuable. Not lovable. Your identity, instead of being positive, becomes negative. And one way to understand shame is that as shame builds in your life, it requires you to be angry at yourself. Because you don't that you're unlovable. You hate that you don't have any value for who you are. Or at least that's what you think. Though that is not true. But that's what you think is true. And your anger naturally turns inwards. Because of shame and complex trauma. what I do with clients all the time is I put on the board, who are the people that you've been angry with. they'll start with partner, parents, family, friends. Then they'll go to authorities. Cops, bosses, CFS, et cetera. Then that'll go to. He's the ultimate authority. And then it'll go to self. And then they begin to realize.

    "output": "People from complex trauma, one of the things I hear them say to me very often is, I don't know who I am. to begin, why don't people from complex trauma know who they are. And I want to give you four reasons why that is. if you think of a child coming into the world, they have all of these competing needs and drives inside of them. one of the needs is, or drives is to be authentic, to be who they are. But they also have a need to be loved, to be accepted, to connect with other people. And a child coming into the world, if it's in a healthy home, they're able to be authentic and they wait, will I be accepted. Will I be loved. And yes, they are accepted. Yes, they are loved. Yes, they connect. And in their mind, being authentic is a good thing and I can just be me and I can be loved and connected for who I am. But bring that in complex trauma. The child comes into an unhealthy situation and they decide to be authentic, but that doesn't work for them. No one wants to connect with them. They're punished or laughed at or teased or criticized for parts of who they are when they're authentic. And what they quickly realize is if I want to be loved, if I want to connect with people, I have to hide who I am. I can't be authentic. And I have to learn how to wear masks. I have to learn how to sense what other people want from me and become what they want, be a chameleon. I have to adopt different roles and situations that people will me, respect me, and want to be my friend. And very early on, they have this core belief that develops, I can't be who I am. I have to be somebody else. that leads to not knowing who they really are because the early understanding of who they are, the earlier they learn, the more they in life you had to wear masks and not be authentic and adopt roles, the greater chance that you don't know who you are because you've always worn masks, always played roles. that's the first reason.

confront them and tell them they're messed up and that they're all of a sudden gonna want to change the best way to get them to be open to change is if they see you changing they see you getting healthy they see you responding differently all of a sudden that's going to influence them impact them and potentially cause them to go maybe I need to look at some stuff you have to really realize that the way to get change is to be open to change and to be open to change and to be open to change get my partner my parents to be willing to consider change is that I have to be the change I have to role model it I have to change and that potentially will put salt in their oats that will get them a thirst a curiosity to learn more and to be maybe willing to change one of the things that you might do if you're in a relationship and don't do but let's get this in balance is this don't just idly threaten somebody to leave it to you just bring it along and just make it them saying if you don't change if you don't look at your stuff if you don't watch these videos i'm out of here but you don't really mean it that is really going to backfire but you may need to sit down with your partner and say unless i see some changes in you some willingness to learn this relationship's not going to work and i'm going to have to consider moving on and that leads us to the rationale for that which is the second bottom line and that is realizing that a relationship can only work or a relationship could only be healthy if both people are getting healthy in their individual life which means that both people are willing to change both people are willing to work on their stuff both people are willing to learn and to grow as individuals if only one person is changing but the other person is remaining in their behaviors that aren't healthy the one person being willing to change isn't going to create a healthy relationship they can want it desperately they can be willing to grow and change as much as possible but if the other person is not willing to change you will never end up with a healthy relationship it is impossible that is important to understand because many people keep hoping that if they just change a little bit more then the relationship will get healthy no it takes two to tangle the other person if they're not willing to change their relationship will not work and that's why you may have to go to the other person once you realize they're not willing to change and say hey if you're not willing to change then this relationship is done now let me give you a big picture here as we build this scaffolding what i've done much marriage counseling over the years and what i've realized is when you get two people with complex trauma in a relationship you end up with three sets of baggage person a comes in with their own individual baggage from their trauma from their past person b comes in with their individual baggage from their trauma from their past then as they live together they create a third person who is willing to change their relationship and that's what we call a healthy relationship and that's what we call a healthy relationship and that's what we call a healthy relationship and that's what we call a healthy set of baggage unresolved conflicts between them unresolved issues and what typically happens when a couple comes to see me for marriage counseling is they're focused on the third set of baggage the problems that have developed between them they're hoping that i will give them tools which usually is magical fix for the third set of baggage and then their relationship will be fine in their mind the issue is the problems that have developed between them if they could just fix them the relationship would be good what i want them to realize is the third set of baggage came out of baggage a baggage b that hasn't been dealt with that hasn't been resolved the way to fix the third set of baggage is not some magical little tools although we're going to have some tools the way to fix the third set of baggage is person a's got to work on their baggage person b's got to work on their baggage and as they get healthier they're going to have to work on their baggage and as they get healthier then they can resolve the third set of baggage the bottom line is this you can't fix problems in a relationship unless both people individually are willing to work on their individual stuff once they get to a healthy enough point then they will learn tools to resolve some of the third set of baggage but if they don't work on their own set of stuff they're just going to create a barrier to resolve the third set of baggage and then they can resolve the third set of baggage and then they can resolve the third set of baggage and then they can resolve more and more third type of baggage.",

What is it that you have to work on and create in order to have a healthy relationship. And I say this because many people think there's some little magic fix to create a magic healthy relationship. No, a healthy relationship comes out of two people getting healthy and building a foundation of certain characteristics in the relationship. getting healthy means both people have a humility and that means both people are wanting to change, are wanting to grow, are willing to live. And I say this because many people think there's some little magic fix to create a look at their stuff, willing to own their stuff. They don't go to this shame place that I got. I got to make it everybody else's fault. I'm afraid to go there because it might make me look bad and everybody will reject me. They're willing to go there. They have to have this humility. But then a relationship has to have mutual respect that you respect me as much as I respect you. It's not lopsided. It's not a one way respect. Third, we have to be able to attach to form secure, healthy connection. And most people coming out of complex trauma have never had secure attachment and don't know how to have secure attachment unless they learn that they're never going to have a healthy relationship. Next, that includes you have to learn to be able to connect with yourself. If you're not able to connect with yourself in a secure way, you're not going to be able to have a healthy relationship. that's the first thing. And then the second thing is to have a healthy connection. And then the third thing is to have a healthy connection. You have to be able to connect with others. learning connection is critical. Next, if we don't learn to be able to trust each other, we'll never have a healthy relationship. we have to be trustworthy, safe people where we can build trust. If we don't learn to accept each other for who we are, that doesn't mean we accept the harmful pieces.",

They've allowed the narcissist to be a mirror. They've allowed the narcissist to be a mirror. They've allowed the narcissist to be a mirror. They've allowed the narcissist to be a mirror. They've said nice things back to the narcissist. They've looked good. They've taken care of the narcissist. Emotions they've covered for the narcissist. It's been a great deal for the narcissist. The only person who has suffered are the people close to the narcissist that have been used, that have been abused. But it's been a great deal for the narcissist. what I want you to be aware of is a lot of people think I'm in a relationship with a narcissist. I need to be a good partner. I need to stay true. I need to hang in there. I need to make a few more sacrifices. Then maybe the narcissist will see all the sacrifices and be willing to change. No, all of your enabling behavior is just convincing the narcissist that their deal is working. Why bother changing.",

They're starting to suspect they're not willing to change, but they're not fully convinced yet. what I would say to people is this. It typically takes six months. A year to really become convinced a person is not willing to change. you need to be able to communicate clearly with that person that you're not happy that you're doing this work. You don't see them doing this work that you need them to be able to be willing to face their stuff. You need to really lay it out clearly, not in an angry, disrespectful, hurtful way. Just this is what I'm seeing. These are the facts. This is what I'm working. With. Then you need to watch what they do. And that's going to take six months to a year to really be sure that because they may try to make little changes to make you happy. And you might get your hopes up a little bit. But over six months to a year, you're going to realize if those changes are lasting changes, if they're willing to work on the deep stuff, it's going to take time. You have to be willing to give yourself time. But you have to have those boundaries in place, those things that you're looking for as marks of lasting change of deep change.",

The relationship just becomes a pain. It becomes a burden. There's no fun in it anymore. It is constant work. It is constant dealing with pain and frustration and anger. And for many people staying together in the same house, it just is not work. Now beware though that a narcissist might say. Say. I think we can still stay together and work on our stuff separately.

Get your focus on yourself changing yourself asking yourself. Why was I attracted to a narcissist in the first place. What is it in me. What are my issues that caused me to be attracted to a narcissist. What is my relationship template from a childhood that causes me to be attracted to a narcissist.

Not only have that lopsided thing that they need to do all the work and earn love and a healthy relationship. It means they need to give up more their needs and make more sacrifices. That's a big issue codependency their own shame issues, but there's often a second issue for many people and that is they have always had a fantasy element in their childhood when it comes to relationships. they have felt an outsider. They felt not good enough. they created fantasies in their mind where they're going to find a night and shining. On.

It bloody implodes a house of cards in a hurricane. You have to understand, this isn't a minor disturbance. It's a seismic event. It is the pulling of the cornerstone from a structurally unsound building, and the collapse that follows is not only inevitable, it is absolute. I've seen this in my clinical practice more times than I can count. I'm thinking of a client, a woman of 35, who came to me absolutely hollowed out by a lifetime of being the designated problem in her family. For three and a half decades, every argument, every financial stress, every marital spat between her parents, every failure of her golden child, brother, it was all somehow her fault. She was the lightning rod for the family's dysfunction. She absorbed the blame for sins she didn't commit, and for problems that had existed long before she was even born. Finally, after a particularly brutal episode of psychological warfare waged by her mother, she did the unthinkable. She went no contact. She changed her number, blocked them on social media, and refused all attempts at communication. You might think this would bring a quiet resolution. You would be catastrophically wrong. What happened. What happened next was a psychological detonation. Within six months, her mother, the narcissistic matriarch, had a nervous breakdown severe she required hospitalization. Her enabling father, lost without his wife's primary target, began drinking heavily. Her two siblings, who had gleefully participated in the scapegoating, suddenly turned on each other with a venom that shocked everyone. The golden child, stripped of his foil, developed a crippling anxiety, and the parents' marriage, once a united front against their difficult daughter, teetered on the brink of a nasty divorce. The entire kingdom fell into chaos because its dragon slayer, its sin eater, had walked off the job. You see, a narcissistic family system is not a democracy. It is a tyranny, and it has a very specific architecture. It's built a pyramid. At the very top sits the narcissist, the pharaoh, whose fragile ego, is the sun around which all other bodies must orbit.",

    "output": "The narcissistic parent, starved for a target, turns their critical gaze upon them, and the golden child's world begins to crumble. The enabler, too, faces a crisis. The spouse or sibling who co-signed the narcissist's narrative can no longer hide behind the smokescreen of the scapegoat's issues. The real problems in the family, the narcissist's volatility, the marriage's emptiness, are now laid bare, and the enabler is left standing in the harsh light of reality with no one else to blame. From a neurological standpoint, this panic is almost a foregone conclusion. The narcissistic brain is, in some fundamental way, incapable of self-correction through introspection. Its entire processing system is geared towards externalization. When faced with a problem or a personal failing, the default pathway is not to ask, what did I do wrong. But who can I blame. The scapegoat provides a permanent, reliable answer to that question. Removing them is removing a limb. The brain's body map still registers its presence and doesn't know how to function without it. It keeps sending signals to a limb that is no longer there. There's a chilling historical parallel here. Think of totalitarian regimes. They absolutely require a primary enemy and other to blame for all the state's failings. They need a Goldstein, a Trotsky, a class of hoinomies of the people. This external enemy serves to unify their followers, to distract from internal corruption, and to justify their authoritarian control. When that enemy is defeated or disappears, what happens. The regime doesn't relax into a benevolent peace. It immediately begins to search for a new enemy. It has to, or else it risks facing the consequences of its own incompetence and collapsing from within. The narcissistic family is a totalitarian state in miniature, and the scapegoat is its designated enemy of the people. The philosopher Ren Girard wrote extensively about this. His scapegoat mechanism is a cornerstone of his thought, the idea that human societies are built on mimetic desire. We want what others want, which inevitably leads to rivalry and conflict. To prevent this conflict from tearing the society apart, the community unconsciously converges on a single individual, a scapegoat, and projects all of its collective violence and sin onto them. The ritual killing or expulsion of the scapegoat purges the community's tension and restores a temporary, fragile peace. This is what's happening in these families.",

All those negative traits the narcissist couldn't stand in themselves. The laziness, the incompetence, the malevolence, the shame, they didn't just disappear. They were projected, externalized, and dumped into the scapegoat. The scapegoat became the container for the parent's shadow self. But when the container is removed, where does all that darkness go. It comes roaring back to its source. The narcissist is suddenly forced to confront the very demons they've spent a lifetime denying. And because their psychological immune system is virtually non-existent, they have absolutely no defense, against this onslaught of self-loathing. From a neurological perspective, it's a brutal withdrawal. The narcissistic brain's reward system, which for decades has been conditioned to fire in response to the drama of scapegoating, goes haywire. The reliable source of dopamine hits is gone. The parent is left in a state of anhedonia and agitation, pacing the cage of their own mind, desperately seeking something to fill the emptiness. This is when you see the narcissist. This is when you see the narcissist. This is when you see the narcissist. This is when you see the frantic search for replacement supply. They might suddenly develop a mysterious, dramatic illness that requires constant attention. They might leap into a new whirlwind relationship, seeking the initial validation of a new admirer. They might start feuds with neighbors or colleagues. They will join dating apps, overshare on social media, insert themselves into their other children's lives with a suffocating intensity. Anything absolutely impossible can happen. And if you're not sure what to do, you can start a new relationship with a new admirer. And if you're not sure what to do, you can start a new relationship with a new admirer. And if you're not sure what to do, you can start a new relationship with a new admirer. And if you're not sure what to do, do absolutely anything to get a reaction, to get a hit, to prove they still exist. This dynamic is explained with devastating clarity in the work of Heinz Kohout, a psychoanalyst who developed the field of self-psychology. Kohout argued that narcissists have a fragmented, underdeveloped sense of self.",

A self-object is another person who isn't experienced as a self. isn't experienced as a separate individual, but as an extension of the narcissist's own self, there to provide validation and mirroring. The scapegoat is the ultimate negative self-object. They exist to confirm the narcissist's grandiosity by embodying everything the narcissist is not. When the scapegoat reclaims their status as a separate human being, they are, in essence, amputating a part of the narcissist's psychological self. And let's be brutally clear about the biological reality here. This isn't just emotional dependence. This is neurochemical dependence. The stress hormones, the adrenaline, the cycle of tension and release created by the family drama, this becomes a physiological baseline. The narcissist's body becomes addicted to the chaos. The peace and quiet that follows a scapegoat's departure is, to them, not peaceful at all. It's the terrifying silence of, withdrawal, a sensory deprivation that their system registers as a threat to its very survival. And modern culture, particularly social media, pours gasoline on this fire. It offers the narcissist a global stage for their victim narrative, a host of new avenues for harassment, and a potentially endless supply of superficial validation from strangers who don't know the real story. But here's the thing that's even more disturbing. While the narcissist, the narcissistic parent, is having their identity crisis, writhing in the agony of withdrawal, something else is happening to the other family members who were left behind. The shockwaves of the scapegoat's departure are just beginning to reach them, and the entire rotten structure is preparing for its next, even more catastrophic collapse. What do you do when the person who's been absorbing all the family's dysfunction for 30 years suddenly isn't there anymore. What happens when the emotional black hole that consumed all the rage, all the disappointment, all the bitterness, simply vanishes. If you're the golden child, the one who built your entire identity on the reflected glory of not being the problem, you bloody panic.

You don't get to remove a foundational piece of a structure and expect the rest of it to remain standing. The departure of the scapegoat is the first domino to fall, and what follows is a cascade of psychological collapse that ripples through every remaining member of the family. First and most spectacularly comes the golden child's fall from grace. For their entire life, the golden child's identity has been a comparative one. They were the golden child's identity. The good one, the successful one, the easy one. But only in relation to the scapegoat who was designated the bad one, the failure, the difficult one. The scapegoat was the dark background against which their gold could glitter. They never had to develop a robust, independent sense of self. Their worth was guaranteed by the system. But when the scapegoat leaves, the background vanishes. Suddenly, the golden child is standing alone on a brightly lit stage, and for the first time, the narcissistic parent's critical gaze falls directly upon them. Every minor mistake is now a catastrophe. Every B plus is a failure. Every decision is questioned. The narcissist starved for a target, needs a new place to project their disappointment, and the golden child is the most convenient candidate. The very position that was once their shield now becomes their prison. I saw this with devastating clarity. In one family I worked with, the scapegoat, a daughter, went no contact after decades of abuse. Within three months, her older brother, the golden child, a successful lawyer, developed a severe anxiety disorder. He started having panic attacks before going to court. Why. Because his narcissistic father, who had once lauded his every move, now relentlessly criticized him. The father, deprived of his primary target, had simply re-aimed himself. He was forced to use his weapon. At the same time, the enabling father of another family, whose wife was the primary narcissist, began drinking heavily within months of his scapegoated son's departure. For years, he had used his son's troubles as a distraction, a reason to stay out late, a topic of commiseration with his friends. Without that excuse, he was left with the stark, unbearable reality of his empty marriage and his own co-ordiness.",

If they cannot control you, they will, by God, control the story about you. And this isn't just a few angry words whispered behind your back. It is a systematic, relentless, and often brutally effective campaign to destroy your reputation, your relationships, and your social standing. This is the smear campaign, and it is the narcissistic parent's primary weapon in the war against the scapegoat's freedom. The first volley is always character assassination. The parent becomes the master historian of your pathology, rewriting your entire life story through the lens of your supposed dysfunction. Your childhood independence becomes oppositional defiance. Your adolescent struggles become proof of instability. Your adult success becomes a lucky break you didn't deserve. They will lie, they will exaggerate, they will twist truths into monstrous perversions of reality. They do this to convince others, but first and foremost, they do it to convince themselves to reinforce the crumbling victim narrative that is central to their identity. To wage this war, the narcissist needs an army, and they recruit their flying monkeys, a term drawn from the Wizard of Oz that perfectly captures the dynamic. These are the enablers, the other siblings, the gullible relatives and family friends who are deputized and sent out to do the narcissist's bidding. They are armed with the narcissist's distorted narrative, and dispatched to harass the scapegoat to report back with information and to spread the poison of the smear campaign throughout the community. They are the agents of the tyrant. And often, they don't even realize the role they're playing. They genuinely believe they are helping a concerned parent or mediating a family dispute. They have been weaponized. In the modern age, this warfare has gone digital. The narcissist uses technology as a force multiplier with terrifying efficiency. They will stalk your social media accounts, creating fake profiles to bypass your blocks. They will send your friends and colleagues long, rambling emails filled with concerns about your mental health.",

Yes. And it's those early experiences, for you, are those the things then that you could classify as traumas. That they become embedded in the child and manifest them later in life as something. That's. How does that happen. How does it get embedded. , , first of all, what sort of things are they. And then why do they get embedded. trauma basically means a wound. trauma is when you're wounded and that wound persists and has impact in your life later on. trauma, this is important to distinguish. Trauma is not what happens to you. Trauma is what happens inside you as a result of what happens to you. I just came back from Budapest. I was there presenting this book on Hungarian. And this is, I don't know who designed this, but I went, , one of the things that I have to do every day is swim. You don't want to talk to me if I haven't swum,. And I swam this morning already. It's. in Budapest, I was staying at a hotel, and around the corner there's a swim club where I go swimming every morning. Across the street, directly across the street, as far from us as, say, the second row here, is the building where my mother and I lived when I was 11 months old, and I nearly died there. And she gave me to a stranger in the street on the same paving stones that are still there. And I didn't see her for five or six weeks. A lot of people know this story. The trauma wasn't that she gave me to a stranger. The trauma is what I made it mean.",

    "output": "Now any child, what can a child make it mean except that I'm being abandoned. And who gets abandoned. Somebody who's not lovable. Somebody who's not wanted. the trauma then is my sense of not being wanted, and not being lovable, not being considered important enough. Now that trauma plays itself out for decades afterwards. it's not what happened to me as such. Because when you look at it objectively, what happened to me as such was that my mother gave me to a stranger, and the stranger took me. Those are both huge acts of love, actually. That's the universe loving this child to take care of it. But that doesn't matter. It's what I make it mean. the wound is then what happens within us. That gets embedded in the nervous system as emotional memory, not as recollection. I don't recall being given to a stranger by my mother, because the parts of the brain that recall aren't even online at that age yet. It doesn't come online until years later. But the emotional memory of being hurt and being abandoned and not being wanted, that's embedded in the nervous system. And then it gets triggered whenever anything even vaguely resembling it later on, decades later, shows up. In fact, if you look at the expression being triggered, it's a really interesting expression. These days, we're, , trigger warning,. Don't you trigger me. , here's the thing. What can be triggered. For a trigger to do anything, a trigger is a very small little thing. For a trigger to have any impact whatsoever, there has to be an ammunition there. There has to be explosive charge. when I get triggered, it's not because somebody did something. It's because what they did happened to set off the explosion. And that explosive charge, the emotional baggage that I'm carrying. if I carry the emotional baggage of somebody who doesn't have a sense of being wanted and being important, anything later on that reminds me of that will trigger me and drive my behavior. that's how trauma works. It's embedded in the nervous system, in the brain, in the form of emotional subverbal memory. Nothing you. By the way, I'm sorry to say, one more thing. It's also embedded in the body.",

It's not you chose to do it. It's just that, , this is how your organism survived, by depressing your emotions. Now you're going to keep doing that. In fact, you'd be afraid not to. And later on, you're diagnosed with this disease. But it begins as a coping mechanism. And there's many others of these coping mechanisms that are associated with survival. And therefore, we don't give them up. Because if our survival depends on being a certain way, if that's what we learned, we're not going to give it up that easily. Especially as you point out, children have very few options. The ones that are built into us as mammals, it's fight, flight, or freeze. , if you're a baby, you can't fight. And it's very difficult to run away. it doesn't leave you with much, does it. Except, as you say, just to freeze and. And it's that need for attention. Attachment. This is a word that you deal with a lot. Tell us about attachment. this is a conflict that is probably central to my work in all manner of conditions. And in all kinds of situations. It's a very powerful dynamic in adult relationships, for example. The child has an absolute need to belong to the parents and to be cared for by the parents. That drive to be close to somebody, in order to be taken care of, or to take care of the other for that matter, is called attachment. And mammals are creatures of attachment. They can't survive without attachment, without the caring relationship, obviously. The young cannot survive. attachment, that's fine. But then we have this other need that's also determined by evolution, which I call authenticity. And just out of the self's authenticity, being in touch with ourselves, being in touch with our feelings and our bodies and our emotions.

    "output": "there are these archetypes and types of narcissism and i think it's worthwhile to go through some of them and you've outlined them in your book and written about it previously can you walk us through those the most classical form of narcissism that we most often think about is grandiose narcissism and the grandiose narcissistic person is it's almost our armchair textbook definition arrogant pretentious preening look at me status oriented really cares about appearances interestingly of all the types of narcissism grandiose narcissistic folks kind of have the best outcomes believe it or not because they're not as victimized as long as things are going generally the way the grandiose narcissist wants i'm not saying it's a healthy relationship i mean we're talking about really matters of what's the best worst disease to get kind of thing here it's it's really a matter of though the grandiose narcissistic person really cares about appearances they're very forward facing that's the the the the the the the the the the the the grandiose narcissists and that typically even in the dsm and other diagnostic spaces that formulation of narcissism is what we've classically focused on however especially in the last 10 years there's been more focus on what's called vulnerable narcissism which to me is probably the most important evolution in this conversation the vulnerable narcissistic person is the one we often miss because they're not quite as charming charismatic shiny compelling these are folks who are sullen petulant resentful victimized passive aggressive they are angry at everyone in the world they feel everyone has gotten more than them why me what was me which hun everyone's out to get me and but and also vulnerable narcissistic people may be more sad they may be very socially anxious to somebody looking from the outside in they'll actually say this person's not narcissistic they're kind of not put together actually and they often sort of pull for being rescued a lot of people will get caught up in trying to help them let me give them an opportunity let them give me a let me know if i can help them and they're willing to help me just to be there for them let me give them an opportunity let them give me a let me know what i can do i'm going to help them and i'm going to do it this way and let me let me get them help them and i'm going to get them help them and i'm going to find them how to make them give them a couch to sleep on let me give them let me borrow them let me loan them some money let me help them and then it becomes this literally a vortex a black hole to which you could just keep putting more and more and it's never enough and they sort of remain frozen in time and space no matter how much resource time support encouragement you give them that's the vulnerable narcissist now grandiose and vulnerable narcissism are sort of these kind of these complementary structures if things start going wrong and wrong and wrong and wrong and wrong for the grandiose narcissists they start looking a vulnerable narcissist sullen petulant aggrieved everyone's out to get me if things start going really for the vulnerable narcissists their grandiosity will pop out people are either more primarily grandiose or more vulnerable but circumstances can kind of flip it and sort of make that other form of narcissism show up the next form of narcissism could i insert one thing there just to clear one of the things that i heard you share previously is that vulnerable narcissist even though we talked about women being the brunt of most of the narcissistic behavior the receiving end of it you typically would find when you do find a woman who's a narcissist it's often more likely to be a vulnerable nurse correct is that absolutely vulnerable narcissism is pretty much equally distributed between genders grandiose narcissism is much more prevalent in men malignant narcissism is where we're talking about that more severe narcissism we may still see some of the the charm and the charisma but we can also see a callousness at this point there is a lot of vindictiveness in the malignant narcissist there is the willingness to take advantage of people's vulnerabilities isolate another person the charm is really kind of short-lived and not nearly as shiny as it is with the grandiose narcissistic person malignant narcissistic people be very controlling and the way that might have been the case is that when we talk about the male narcissistic people we're talking about the male narcissistic people we're talking about the male narcissistic people we're talking about even show up in an intimate relationship is they may be intently focused on someone else i want to spend all my time with you why do you want to spend time with your friends aren't you into me they might do things buy them a phone as a gift which is a way they can track them i always tell young people don't ever accept a device or a phone as a gift from someone you're in an intimate relationship with it's very dangerous you maintain your own phone accounts and your own devices always until you are certain that this is a safe relationship but that seems a generous gift you could get from someone it's it's those kinds of things that a malignant narcissistic person would do those relationships can get dangerous and of all the forms of narcissistic relationships physical violence and aggression is going to be most likely to show up in a malignant narcissistic relationship and then secondarily in a vulnerable narcissistic relationship then we get to some interesting forms of narcissism most pointedly the communal narcissist the communal narcissistic person is the i call them sort of the sort of the shirt off your back narcissist these are the people who say i'm the least confident of people these are certain brothers and sisters i tell them to stretch out and you can do Blazer if you need to.",

    "output": "And they wait to see if you'll say something or if you'll let it slide. And if you let it slide, you're understood. They'll take more. That's how they operate. But when you enforce a boundary, you show them something they don't expect you won't bend just to keep the peace. Here's the thing about boundaries. They don't have to be loud or dramatic. It's understood. They don't need a big speech attached. In fact, the most powerful boundaries are usually silent actions, not words. You don't argue. You don't justify. You don't try to convince them why the boundary matters. You just stand. You're impermanent. Stood. If you decide you won't answer late night calls, you don't explain why. You just stop picking up. If you decide you won't respond to insults, you don't say, that hurts my feelings for the hundredth time. You just don't respond. Stood. If you decide you're not available for manipulation, you simply remove yourself when it happens. That's what makes boundaries effective. They're not a debate. They're a decision. Understood. Empaths often struggle with this because they want to be understanding. They don't want to upset people. They want harmony. But here's the truth. Harmony can't exist when you're constantly sacrificing your peace for someone else's control. Stood. A narcissist doesn't care about your harmony. They care about your compliance. And the second you start putting boundaries in place, you send a message they can't ignore. You're not available to be used. Understood. What makes boundaries drive narcissists crazy is that it cuts off their access to what they want most, your attention, your energy, your willingness to bend. Every time you uphold a boundary, you're basically saying, understood. You don't run the show anymore. And that is their worst nightmare. Because for them, power is everything. Boundaries strip that power away without you even raising your voice. Think about how different it feels when you don't argue back. Understood. When you don't justify, when you don't keep re-explaining yourself, there's no exhaustion. There's no back and forth. There's no chasing your tail in a cycle that goes nowhere. There's just clarity. That clarity is for you, not for them. Understood. Because boundaries aren't about controlling another person's behavior. They're about controlling your own. You can't stop. You can't stop a narcissist from being manipulative. You can't stop them from twisting words. Stood.",

    "output": "You can't stop them from trying to push your buttons, but you can stop yourself from participating in the cycle. And that's what a boundary does. It frees you from the game. Stood. Narcissists hate boundaries because it means their usual tricks don't work. They can try guilt. They can try intimidation. They can try flattery. But if your boundary is solid, none of it lands. And the more consistent you are, understood, the faster they realize you're not someone they can play with. That doesn't mean they'll it. In fact, they'll probably push harder at first, but consistency always wins because eventually, stood. The silence of your boundaries speaks louder than any argument you could ever have with them. It's easy to think you need to defend your choices. To explain why you didn't answer the call or why you walked out of the room, understood, or why you won't tolerate being spoken to a certain way. But the second you explain, you've reopened the door to negotiation. Boundaries aren't negotiable. They're not up for discussion. They're nonverbal proof of your self-respect. Understood. And self-respect is the one thing a narcissist can't take from you unless you hand it over. Narcissists survive on emotional hooks. They throw out insults, praise, guilt trips, or even silence just to see if you'll bite. And the moment you take the bait, they've got you. You're in their web, tangled up in defending yourself, understood, chasing their approval, or trying to smooth things over. That's why detachment is powerful. Detachment is the exact opposite of what they expect from you. They want intensity. They want drama. They want you spinning in circles. Stood. But when you detach, you're Teflon. Nothing sticks. And that drives them crazy because their entire playbook depends on getting a rise out of you. Detachment doesn't mean you stop caring about people altogether. Stood, it doesn't mean you turn into a robot. It means you stop personalizing the behavior of someone who is wired to manipulate. You start to see their actions for what they really are in a pattern, not a reflection of your worth. When they criticize you, stood, you don't crumble because it's not really about you. It's about their need for control. When they ignore you, you don't chase because it's just another test to see if you'll beg for their attention.",

    "output": "Instead of the narcissist being in charge of your emotions, you're in charge of the entire interaction. You set the tone. You decide how far it goes, understood. And when they realize they can't control the mood, they lose leverage. That's why they get louder, more dramatic, more desperate, because your calm is exposing their weakness. Think of calm a mirror, understood. Whatever they throw at you reflects back their own instability. The louder they get, the smaller they look next to your composure. The nastier they become, the clearer it is that their behavior is about them, not you, understood. Calm responses hold up that mirror without you having to say a word. It's a quiet, steady reminder that you're not playing their game anymore. For someone who feeds on drama, calm is the ultimate disruption. It steals their script to it, flips the power, and leaves them with no way to win. That's why staying calm is not just a response. It's a strategy. It's how you walk into the storm and prove without shouting that you're untouchable. There comes a point where silence, understood, boundaries, and calm responses are powerful. But the most powerful move of all is walking away. Not storming off, not slamming doors, not throwing one last insult, just calmly, confidently removing yourself, understood. Walking away is the ultimate mic drop because it's final. It's undeniable proof that you value your peace more than their chaos. And for a narcissist, that is the one thing they can't handle losing the stage, losing the audience, or stood. Losing access to the very person they thought they could control. Walking away isn't about giving up. It's about choosing yourself. It's saying, I don't owe you my time. My energy stood, or my presence. Narcissists want you locked into the cycle forever, the arguing, the defending, the reconciling, the repeating. Walking away breaks that cycle in a way they can't undo. They can spin their stories, understood. They can try to bait you back in. But once you're gone, you're gone. And that absence is louder than any words you could have said while you were still in the room, understood. The reason walking away is disruptive is because narcissists depend on proximity.

And the adopted child, from an early age on, learned, or at least perceived, that she wasn't loved and accepted and celebrated the biological child was. And hence, she worked to make herself lovable. And how do you work to make yourself lovable. By suppressing your own feelings. By always being nice. By always taking care. And always ignoring your own needs. And it was purely unconscious. This is her coping patterns since she was a small child. She did not do it deliberately. And Lou Gehrig's father was an alcoholic. And if any of you grew up in homes where there's alcoholism, how it works. It's that the children, or one of the children, becomes the caregiver to the parents. Emotionally and even physically sometimes. And that then becomes your personality. That then becomes how you live your life. Because you think that's who you are. Because how we are as kids, we think that's who we are. That's not who we are. But that's what we come to believe. And that's who we, that's how we behave then. And that's what creates these patterns. there's nobody here to be blamed here. Nobody here to be blamed. It's just how it works. Now, why does these, why do these patterns translate into illness. That's because, as traditional medicine has always understood, and as Western science, has now confirmed, mind and body are inseparable. if you look at the important systems in the body, in the brain, they're completely connected. that the emotional centers in the brain are connected to the immune system, and the hormonal apparatus, and the nervous system. Now the emotional centers in your brain have one major role to play to keep you alive. Now, what is the biggest need of the newborn. Emotionally speaking. And even physically speaking. It's attachment to the adults. Without that attachment, we don't survive. You can see that.",
