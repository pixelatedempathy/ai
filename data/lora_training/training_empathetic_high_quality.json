And human beings, we no longer live in the environments even close to it in which we evolved. Out there in nature, in small groups connected to each other. Parenting kids was what used to be a group activity. It happened in the tribe, in the clan. Parents had lots of support. Kids spent their whole day around their parents. It wasn't goodbye in the morning, hello in the evening. And most of our time is spent away from each other. That never used to be the case. Not throughout millions of years and hundreds of thousands of years. Now, we can't go back to that life,. Nor would anybody want to necessarily, but we have to understand what we've lost. first of all, you have to understand a few things. Understand a few things. The great Buddhist teacher, Thich Nhat Hanh, who died about a year ago, he said that the greatest gift a parent can give to their child is his or her own happiness. take care of your emotional states because your kid is sensitive enough to be downloading your emotional states and making them their own. if you're stressed, unhappy, depressed, anxious, addicted, believe me, your kid is going to absorb all that and make it about themselves that there's something wrong with them. take care of yourself. Live a life that you can live with. And if you get the first three years , by the way, you got it made. when your kids are really small, consciously make the first three years as stress-free and as clear of psychological dysfunction as possible. That means work on your traumas. Work on your relationship with your partner or your spouse. That's the first thing. Beginning with pregnancy, by the way, number one. Number two, understand what the needs of children are. Needs of children are for unconditional loving, acceptance in the context of a secular relationship where the child doesn't have to work to make their relationship work. The acceptance and the regard should be unconditional. Allow the child to have all their emotions. Whatever the emotions are, let the child have them. Understand them. Don't force them to suppress their emotions. I'm not saying be permissive with behaviors.",

If you are in a situation where you love somebody, but they are manipulating you, it's kind of you are a bit in that dependent relationship because of that love that you feel. It puts you in a situation where you're going to have some motivation to protect that attachment, even if you don't need it for your bread and butter. But you need it emotionally, or you think you do, and that can be weaponized. That can be played on. these are good systems. The attachment system's good. But then these systems, can be used in other contexts against people. In your book, Blind to Betrayal, which every one of you needs to go out there and read immediately. This is one of the best books I've ever read. Every survivor of narcissistic abuse needs to read this book. On this show, we're talking about narcissistic abuse,. We're talking about people who are in relationships that are almost, it's a given that these are betraying relationships. At the core of it, the person with that personality organization who's in the relationship, and motivated by power, dominance, control, and their own insecurity, plus the traits of lack of empathy, entitlement, and all of that, is attempting to basically subjugate another person. , that the other person is acting entirely in their service. And that is sometimes, to me, that inherently is a betrayal. There's an inherent betrayal in somebody who doesn't treat you as an equal psychological player in a relationship. do you agree with that, Framing that betrayal blindness may be basically an element of every single narcissistic relationship. I think that's a very reasonable hypothesis. What you're saying makes complete sense. And certainly, , it makes a particularly big sense if you think about narcissistic relationships that persist over time. That how could that persist over time without some amount of betrayal blindness. Mhmm, mhmm. I'd argue they cannot. And I think that blindness to me fits this because, in the end, they are not the ones with more knowledge of their own needs, and it's the ones who are less likely to be attacked and more likely to be hurt, and are more likely to be abused, and are more likely to be abused, and are more likely to be abused.",

    "output": "Is there any other words of wisdom you'd to leave with survivors of relationships that are characterized by betrayal trauma, betrayal blindness, and DARVO. I do believe very strongly in self-compassion. It takes a lot of energy to beat yourself up and blame yourself when really you were doing the best you could, that the situation was, and maybe still is, not fair and destructive. And that loving yourself and taking care of yourself, it's sort of trite, but it is true that it just is hugely beneficial. It is a good thing you love. It is a good thing you're vulnerable. I love that. I really love the frame you put on this, that it's a good thing to love. We tend to lose that in the conversation about toxic relationships. thank you for bringing it home to that. Dr. Freid, I cannot tell you what an amazing conversation this was. Here are my takeaways. For my conversation with Dr. Jennifer Freid. In my first takeaway, after listening to Dr. Freid talk about betrayal blindness, it seems that almost everyone who is in or has ever been in a narcissistic relationship has experienced some level of betrayal blindness. These are relationships where trust is betrayed regularly. As a psychologist who has worked with people in these situations and with people who stay in the relationships for years, I have witnessed them not seeing or acknowledging what happens, but that not seeing it while it allows them to stay takes a toll on their health and behavior. In many ways, Dr. Freid has given us a blueprint for understanding narcissistic abuse. What happens, why people stay, and how it takes such a toll on health and -being. For my next takeaway, an important observation is this idea of being empowered enough to not only be able to see it, but do something about it. A real struggle for people in any relationship characterized by betrayal trauma is that they are not empowered for any number of reasons. They may be children. They may have less power for societal reasons, ethnicity, gender, social status, or they may simply be in a relationship that is characterized by imbalance and inequity, which by the way, is what we see in narcissistic relationships. She calls this relational asymmetry.",

    "output": "In our next takeaway, one of the most important things that Dr. Fried shared with us is something we already knew, but she put a finer point on it. Love is good. Wanting to love and be loved is good. In a trusting close relationship with a parent or a partner, or even an institution, we are trying to protect something good and necessary. An attachment and love. Our healthy drive to love also explains some of the why of betrayal blindness and also the why of why we stay. Many survivors view themselves as weak or needy or ridiculous for staying, but perhaps you can help them. You can tap into recognizing that you are a person who wants to love and be loved, and that is healthy. Next, the concept of DARVO is not only the architecture of every narcissistic relationship out there, but also rounds out our understanding of gaslighting. Because not only are our reality, perception, and experience denied, we are dismantled and told there is something wrong with us, and then have to carry the burden of believing that we are the offenders and the abusers when they reverse victim and offender. And that is one more piece of how we get stuck in the cycles of self-blame. And finally, once we understand betrayal blindness, we recognize that healing means discernment. We recognize that healing means discernment. We recognize that healing means discernment. The ability to detect betrayal. Learning about the mechanics of betrayal blindness and DARVO. Then, you can see the betrayals and call them what they are. Foster support and healthy relationships with a foundation of trust. Support other people who are going through these experiences and practice self-compassion. Remember, the very best part of you, the part of you that simply wanted to love and be loved, was played upon and manipulated. But you can still hold on to that as a healthy part of yourself.",

This is a little dark, but there's a point to it. my father, who had narcissistic personality disorder, put me in the role as the dumb child. this video is about recovering from the childhood trauma damage of having a parent who was profoundly selfish, manipulative, and made you feel invisible. Whether you call them a narcissist or emotionally immature or something else, it's actually the damage that matters most in our recovery. Not analyzing the parent much, although that is a crucial step that we all have to go through, the way we kind of wake up to that. the damage or the impact, if you prefer, in our present lives can look issues feeling you could lose your job at any moment or feeling you're always in trouble with someone somehow. And I'm listing some other common ways that the damage or the impact shows up here too. And it makes sense why we have those residual issues given if you had a narcissistic parent who wasn't the healthy, safe home base that all children need, but they actually had significant problems of their character. Problems of character in a parent can look a parent who is insanely entitled, a parent who is manipulative and weaponizes issues in the family or in your childhood or over basics usually, and a parent who is volatile or vindictive. And there are some other common unsafe character traits too that we don't have to list all of them. And this is super important here. When their responsibility as a parent is to actually protect children from those dynamics that I just listed on the screen, that's what a healthy parent does is protect their kids from issues and behaviors that. But I also don't wanna spend all of our time on the parent because focusing on the damage or the impact is going to be more helpful to you than I think than focusing perpetually on the parent's diagnosis or their behaviors. But we do need to touch on them to explain the damage. Here is what I mean by that. Instead of only focusing on their behaviors, here are some questions for our work today, as if this was a session.

Inner child work is the work of becoming connected to self instead of running to or running from connection with others. Here are some benefits and ideas to inner child work. Integration is being aligned with our inner child enough to make separation and conflict in our lives manageable. Think we'll be no matter what as a loving truth between you and your inner child. And I don't mean you become a hermit. I mean you're able to self-soothe instead of needing that much from others or actually running from it. And I kind of needed to learn how to self-soothe from a good therapist to teach me how to do that. If your dating life feels. dependent on having someone in your life and being alone is a trigger, it might be good and time to work on your relationship with yourself I had to do. Even if I had the most amazing girlfriend in my life back in the day and I still would have had that disconnection with myself. it's important. Inner child work is very helpful in terms of managing attachment triggers that do come up such as conflict, disconnection, and doubt. Inner child work is about developing a healthy inner adult who can help the inner child. Not project onto others much or feel everything is a shoot. The final category is how we deal with insecurity through emotional confidence. Emotional confidence related to security has a lot to do with how we deal with our feelings and our relationship to our feelings and our ability to communicate and express our feelings. Here's a hypothetical with these. Let's say a seven-year-old just went through their parents divorcing and now abruptly they have a moody step-parent in their day. Life is a very common presentation for childhood trauma. How we deal with our feelings. Let's say that child gets no help at all with that big change in their life. It's never talked about or addressed and they develop a coping strategy of disassociation or fawning or fantasy.",

It's dangerous to not know who is safe and who is not and that's a symptom of how the adults reacted to monsters, in the family life and regarding our ability to communicate in our present lives or our confidence in that not just in this hypothetical but related is what would happen to you as a kid.

The are we good's fantasy in a relationship is I just want to know if I'm finally acceptable to you, if that's for you. Isn't this just who I am. The are we good the others, they are conditioned in a knee jerk strategy of being tolerated and helping that they lose a sense of self. They lose their , they lose their autonomy, they lose their personhood in that. And while being caring, and kind or noble, there's definitely worse things to be in the world. It's not coming from an open heartedness place. It's coming from a place of fear and anxiety and being wounded. There's a paradox for the are we good.",

That moment is when I started to really build up a sense of self for the first time. And yes, as simple and as cliched and as Stuart Smalley as it sounds, that's actually a Saturday Night Live character from in the way back. You can just Google Stuart Smalley and you'll see what I mean. I'm good enough. I'm smart enough. The difference is that statement came from somebody else that was a group member to me. if you've lived your life in black and white, coming into color is really a new experience with having a knowledge that you're a good person. I'll say it sort of for you all. You're a good person. And I really hope that can have an impact on you. Lastly, part of not having a healthy sense of self means that feeling is dependent on things I said, performance or how we look or if people seem to value us in the moment. But it's dependent on outside fickle kind of changes such as a date not liking us. we can really, it's we're too much flapping around in the wind not having a sense of self. That's also why being in an abusive or narcissistic relationship is a vicious cycle where the abuser's approval of us gives us a sense of self and safety but it's fleeting and inconsistent. One hour you're on, one hour you're off. changing approval is also a sign of having a poor sense of self. Raise your hand out there if you've ever been caught up in that. And to close, I want you to know that your sense of self is already there. And it's there in what you feel. What you felt was and wrong when you were a teenager about your family and what you want to become in the world. We just need some help from others to give us kind of a green light to be more of ourselves while helping us get some ideas about who that self is. many of us are surprised when we hear good intentioned people say that we're creative, funny, deep thinking, carefree.",

It sounds you've gotten to a place where you've created a money agreement with yourself that you say, I'm going to give a certain amount to my mom. At certain times that I feel good about. And she doesn't have to pay me back. It's what it sounds. You create a new agreement by going to money therapy. And when we don't have these agreements in place, when someone breaks our agreement, when they lie to us, they say, I need money. I'll pay you back. And they don't. They've broken your heart because they've broken an agreement. And it's sad.

But it's not unusual for that insecure narcissist who wants to keep control to try to hoover them back. Now, if you fall for it and allow yourself to be silent. Allow yourself to be sucked in. That whole cycle is going to begin again. Idealization, devaluation, and discarding. It's just sort of this eternal cycle that's really only going to end if you're the one who's going to be courageous enough to break it. And it can really be quite addictive. Lots of people confuse the excitement of hoovering and idealization with love. It's really not. It's abuse. And therapy becomes a key tool to at least start thinking about how to end the confusion and the conflation that love and abusive relationship cycles are the same thing. Now, narcissists devalue and discard for many of the reasons mentioned. But also because they devalue intimacy and because they have very limited empathy. They don't really care how these cycles are hurting you or impacting you. They just do it without thinking. And in some ways, the chaos, it feels comfortable for them. They don't have any regard for how it hurts you. But they do kind of the excitement and the roller coaster nature of this cycle. Now, these toxic cycles take a tremendous toll on the people who get stuck in them. Basically, this turns relationships into roller coasters and almost addictive cycles. And these can often perpetuate early childhood patterns you may have had around rejection. In some ways, these toxic cycles keep the relationship exciting for the narcissist. And it's very easy to get sucked into their vortex and cycle. And for some people, this cycle, strangely enough, becomes sort of a reenactment of trying to win over their unwinnable parent in childhood. It almost feels familiar to be rejected. And it can feel exciting. When you are hoovered back in and idealized for a minute. And in that moment, you're almost taken back to childhood where you feel , I've won that parent over. But then when the devaluing and discard cycles happen, and it's inevitable that they will, sadly, those cycles feel familiar too. And your ancient script of feeling you're not enough gets activated again. Now, some people allow this cycle to happen.",

Once you fully, truly understand that, kind of shrugging your shoulders and either ending contact or at the very least minimizing contact and engagement to an extreme degree starts to feel easy. Because frankly, once the people who had these scapegoated roles can shrug them off and maybe even gain meaning and purpose from the suffering of these roles, they really become our rock stars. They can become champions of the oppressed. They can become advocates. They bring tremendous empathy into the room. And they can often be really great bully slayers. And if people who are once scapegoated can trust their guts as adults, they can actually be the best red flag detectors, in the room. I recognize that people who had a scapegoated role have really, really been through it. It can have been quite traumatic. And that these patterns in childhood can impact social and emotional development through the lifespan as attachment and mental health. But I've said it before, I'm going to say it again. In the words of the great poet Rumi, the wound is where the light enters you. And in this way, anyone who has a history of being a scapegoat, or a history of having been scapegoated, is often just brimming forth with light. Pay forward the empathy that you never got from your family. I promise you it will pay dividends. Just make sure you steer clear of the narcissists who are all too happy to snatch away that empathy and keep you in a scapegoated role. for those of you who had that scapegoated role in childhood, I hope this actually is consistent with your experience. If you have had other experiences, that would be great to hear. But it was a wretched role to have as a child. And I will say, another important issue to remember about people who had that scapegoated role in childhood, they often go on to become tremendous parents. Because many people who were scapegoats in childhood vowed that if they ever do get to be a parent, they will never do this to their own children.",

Three, you are made to feel solely responsible for the quality of your relationship with a parent, primary caregiver, dominant sibling, or others in your family. If there are problems in the relationship, it is viewed as being your fault, no matter what. Four, you have been labeled a liar, crazy, mentally, or, and, or, I should say, emotionally ill by one or more family members. And that can be part of the scapegoat narrative that family members get inoculated into and then adopt, as I've said in other videos, the shock of death of a parent and then the same ideology, propaganda is coming out of the sibling's mouth. And you're shocked because you didn't realize the siblings had actually bought into that narrative about you. You may have distanced, this is still part of number four, you may have distanced yourself from select relatives as a result of continued character assassination.

For example, denying, distorting, there I said it, and twisting events to show themselves in a better light at your expense. And it's really important to remember that if a family member has sexually abused you, either when you were, if it was a sibling, when your children or a parent or step-parent, someone brought into the family, that person who sexually abused you has a vested interest in portraying you as a crazy liar to the outside world.

And if even one of them would I want to encourage you to give yourself the opportunity to begin developing in that direction. I'm not going to say that there's very little to lose in engaging in trauma work because it truly does mean restructuring the way that we approach our lives and our relationships and that can cause a lot of upheaval in our lives. But it also allows us a way out of this kind of emotional and mental chaos that tends to characterize the lives of those who struggle with complex PTSD prior to giving it a proper name. Which naturally transitions me to the first point on this list. the first thing I want to talk about today that characterizes a certain degree of recovery from complex PTSD or toxic shame is you're able to look back at your life including a lot of the chaos and challenge and struggle that has been a significant part of it and you no longer chalk all of that up to you just being a flawed and defective person. this might include things having severe difficulty in forming intimate relationships whether that's friendships or romantic relationships. Or having a hard time with your loved ones. Or having a hard time with your loved one. Or having a hard time with your loved one. Or having a hard time with your loved one. Or having a hard time with your loved one. Or having a hard time with your loved one. Struggling to set and achieve goals that feel meaningful for you. Consistently managing your mental or physical health. Developing healthy communication skills. The list goes on. If you don't understand the root cause of these problems which is in the case of CPTSD developmental trauma it's likely that you're going to spend the majority of your life and your energy managing the symptoms of these problems.

It hammers you into something sharper, stronger, and more deliberate, but it does not turn you into a mirror of the one who wounded you. You rise not by becoming cold, but by becoming clear. This process of transformation is not quick and it is not easy. It demands deep internal work, the willingness to grieve, to rage, to admit vulnerability. It demands that you confront the parts of yourself that were complicit in your suffering, not to blame yourself, but to reclaim the past. Every time you choose growth over bitterness, healing over vengeance, clarity over confusion, you take one more step toward becoming the person the pain was meant to forge. You refuse to let the darkness that touched you define you. Strength gained through transformation is different from the defense of toughness born of resentment. True strength is flexible, not brittle. It bends without breaking. It knows when to fight and when to walk away. It protects without isolating. It is a strength that knows its own power, but does not need to dominate or diminish others to feel secure. This kind of strength carries an authority that cannot be faked or stolen. It radiates from within because it has been earned through fire. Evil is not merely an abstract concept or a distant force operating somewhere far removed from daily life. It often comes close, wearing a familiar face, speaking in gentle tones and disguising itself as love or concern. When you are forced to confront a narcissist, you are not just encountering a difficult personality. You are coming face to face with a concentrated form of deception, manipulation and cruelty. It is a confrontation with something profoundly disorienting because it violates the fundamental trust that underpins human relationships. Yet it is precisely in facing this distortion of goodness that you are called to cultivate virtues that would otherwise remain dormant within you. Courage is the first and most immediate virtue demanded of you. To acknowledge that you are in the presence of malevolence takes tremendous bravery.

Psych2Go's mission is to make psychology and mental health more accessible to everyone. Now back to the video. Have you ever put someone down for their appearance or intellect. Emotional abuse is one of the more common forms of abuse that uses behavioral or emotional tactics to gain a sense of control or to maintain the upper hand in a relationship. It may be subtle and hard to recognize since it often gets swept under the rug as just a part of normal disagreements. Before we begin, we would to mention that this video is for educational purposes only and is not intended to offend or trigger any of our audiences. This video is created that anyone who sees themselves in these behaviors can use this information to improve their relationships and lives. With that said, here are seven signs you might be emotionally abusive. Number one, you jokingly insult people. Have you ever made a joke with the intention of hurting the person you're making fun of. While family and friends may enjoy playful banter with each other, teasing and playful put-downs can end up crossing the line into emotional abuse when the jokes become aggressive and used intentionally to send a negative and hurtful message across. This especially applies when you continue teasing the person, or brush it off as only a joke, even though they've told you to stop and that your comments have become hurtful. Number two, you dismiss others' feelings. Have you ever purposefully ignored or dismissed how someone felt because you thought they deserved it. Everyday life can sometimes be hectic you lose sight of what's happening in other people's lives. After all, you can't know how your loved ones are feeling all the time. But not recognizing someone's feelings may become emotionally abusive when you tell them they're feeling bad. You can't know how they're feeling all the time. You can't know how they're feeling all the time. You can't know how they're feeling all the time. You can't know how they're feeling all the time. You can't know how they're feeling all the time.

And shame causes the sabotage. Shame wins out. Then with the fear of abandonment, what happens is the other person is eventually going to get to see that.

The shame lies. they're going to abandon me eventually. , what, let's just get it over with. I will either abandon them first or I will do a bunch of stuff to sabotage the relationship that they will abandon me. I'll push them to abandon me.

Then when you do something healthy, it feels wrong. if you grew up with narcissists and that was your normal, when you now have a relationship with a healthy person, it feels weird. It feels wrong.

That feels selfish. what happens for a lot of people is to go from an unhealthy template to try to go to a healthy template feels wrong. It feels weird. It feels very uncomfortable.",

That whole belief system of codependency that becomes your normal. Then you have the cycle of abuse that becomes your normal. Things are good, but then they're really bad for a long time.

Just flip a switch. Get over this trauma bond. Break it. it, be done with it. You need to break and be done with it, but it doesn't just happen easily because that bond is hard to break. I'm going to get into healing, but before I do, I want to touch on what are some of the issues around or challenges you have when it comes to breaking a trauma bond. Understand that the trauma bond was orchestrated by the abuser. They drew you into their web. when you try to break it, they're not going to be happy about it. They're going to try to draw you back in. They're going to try to hoover you is the term we use. they're going to love bomb you again. They're going to make false apologies. I'm sorry. They're going to make false promises. I'll do it differently this time. I'll get help. Anything to draw you back in. And one of the things that many people have that once they break, the person.

    "output": "Another reason is children begin to feel in complex trauma that the rules that are being given have nothing to do with what's good for the kid. It's only about what makes the parents' lives easier. they got all kinds of rules that actually are hurting them, restricting them, taking the fun out of life. And now they're just rebelling against rules. Any rule they just assume is a bad rule. And now there's the attraction of the forbidden. There's a knee-jerk reaction to any rule. And again, it started out as a good thing, but it turned into a bad thing. Then what you can see when the child is growing up with parents who are hypocrites is they lose respect for those parents. And now when the parent sets a boundary, they go, why should I keep your boundary. I don't respect you. You don't have healthy boundaries. You're not a healthy person. And it's partly the loss of respect that is happening as. But it's also about the loss of connection or lack of connection. the child's tried to connect, but the parents are too busy. The child doesn't feel safe. The child doesn't feel heard. The child doesn't feel seen. The child is trying to have these people as their safe rock in life, but they're just not there for them. And they just react to that. They respond to that. They go, I'm out of here. I want nothing to do with this. I'll find my connection somewhere else. You are not a safe rock. I am setting up my boundaries now I don't get hurt by you. And then it can finally be children who get hurt over and over again by parents in complex trauma can develop this deep anger that turns into a deep resentment. And now they just want to rebel. They just want to hurt the parents back. They just want to be difficult. They just want to cause the parents grief. That's their way of getting revenge. all of those things can feed into oppositional defiance. There's another characteristic relationship-wise, and that is victim mentality. I need to explain that children in complex trauma are legitimate victims. I'm not judging that. I'm not condemning that. Here is a child whose needs aren't getting met, who is being hurt, and they're trying to fix the problem.",

Next one I've already kind of referred to and it's processing old wounds, old trauma that you've been suppressing for years, but now you're bringing it out and talking about it, processing it, crying about it, healing, feeling the emotions of it. That's exhausting. That is hard work and it is very depleting. if you're in a recovery program, expect to be tired. Another one is if you're carrying an intense resentment towards somebody. That takes a lot of energy. Another one, if you have a conflict, an intense conflict with somebody, you can expect you're going to be exhausted afterwards because that intense conflict took a ton of energy. Next one, if you're sitting in an intense emotion that can't quickly be resolved, you've just lost somebody, you're grieving, you just don't magically make that go away. You've got to sit in it. Or if you're going through a time of change, you're going to be going to a new job, going through a move, there's a lot of anxiety, and insecurity around that, living in the unknown that creates emotions you can't magically make it go away. you've got to sit in them. Sitting in those emotions takes a lot out of you. If you're in a dangerous place, there's a war going on, you're sitting in intense emotions that you can't magically make disappear. If you've got financial problems, you can't just make disappear. Those take a lot out of you, the emotions that you have to sit in. Another important one is when you are supporting somebody who's going through a very painful time. you're listening to them, you're feeling compassion to them, you're spending time with them, you're going to be exhausted. Compassion fatigue is going to be there. Another one is if you get triggered, an old wound, an old issue gets triggered, you feel disrespected, you feel not heard, not seen, rejected, all of that, and you lash out. You lose it.",

Your shame worked out in different ways, but it was shame still running the ship and your children get hurt because you don't set proper boundaries. You don't help them the way that you need to learn to be responsible, your kids get hurt again. Then there's a self-fulfilling prophecy. just think of it this way. Your experience with unsafe people said that being authentic always results in getting hurt. you developed a belief that you thought was the truth, which was actually a truth only because it was with unsafe people. Whereas the truth about healthy living is authenticity with safe people always leads to intimacy. For you, authenticity always leads to hurt. never be authentic. But you developed expectations that whenever you get in a relationship, if you try to be authentic, you will get hurt. what do you do. You go into life based on that belief, those expectations. You get into relationships and you go, I will not share myself. I will not be authentic because that will result in being rejected. That will result in being abandoned. That will result in being hurt. I will try to be invisible. I will put my needs aside. And you come up with all kinds of behaviors that come out of those expectations and beliefs. And what happens. The other person goes, I can't have a relationship with you because you're never authentic. You never open up. You're emotionally unavailable. And they leave you. You get hurt because you were operating off the wrong beliefs out of your complex trauma experiences. A couple more. Growth and change create a desire to return to the old ways. Or another way, words, growth and recovery and changing positively in recovery actually creates fear. And that causes people to want to return to the old ways. let's talk about the old ways.

It wasn't until my early twenties that I discovered that he had been doing. That what he had been doing with me from ages five to thirteen was actually sexual abuse. I just thought that was normal. For years therapists would want me to replay what happened to me as a child. And get to the pain and sadness and I just couldn't. Not because it was too painful.

With a loving and kind voice, I would say to her, Oh, I see. You want to go on a dating site to connect with someone. , Kent, we can't do that now. how about a hug instead.

If I can identify what she needs before she goes looking elsewhere for it, I can stop the dominoes before they begin to fall. Not long ago, I feared aging. Because my body would no longer be sexually desirable. I now know the fear was because I would lose the only way I knew how to feel loved and connected to others. Today, I treat my sexual addiction with love and curiosity when she is trying to get my attention. I thank her for all her years of finding a way for me to feel a little bit more of love in the world of darkness where I grew up. Then I ask her what she needs from me now. Will I ever be able to have healthy sex without the old toxic system taking over. Perhaps. If I keep my emotional love tank topped up on a regular basis and am consistently meeting my emotional needs in a healthy way. For me, I now know that to get to sexual intimacy with someone I have to go through the stages of relationship. that I can build a deep emotional connection and foundation with them.

Their brain has begun to think my need is actually sex. Or my need is truly I need emotional empathy and nurture. But their brain, it goes, I need food. Because grandma always said, Here's a cookie that'll make you feel better. And they've been mistrained as to what their need is and how to meet that need. Some people, once they feel they need self-care because of depletion, their brain always goes to something that is a junk food thing. Let's go get drunk. Let's just eat junk food. Let's just do something that they know is unhealthy. But that's what their brain just seizes. Self-care. Let's break the rules. Let's just self-indulge. be aware of that. Some, they weren't allowed self-care as a kid. They were told they were being lazy or selfish if they relaxed. And now when they start to get depleted and they feel the need for self-care, they go, I just need to go and help somebody. I just need to be busy and take on a project. That's where their brain goes. Others, when they are feeling depleted, they just go to distractions. I'm just going to stay busy. I'm going to organize. I'm going to do stuff I don't feel. And that's been their way of coping. Others, I just need instant gratification. And I'm going to go shopping. And their whole focus becomes, I just need to feel good now. And instant gratification becomes their idea of self-care. Some, they go into a victim mentality when they're depleted. Poor me. My life sucks. They feel sorry for themselves. They tell everybody about how hard their life is, about how tired they are. That's what they think is the solution. And that can actually feed something very unhealthy.",

That means learning to detect when a need is not being met. again, we've done talks on this that hopefully you can go through and that will help you learn how to do this. But that's what self-care really is, is I am learning to take care of myself, not just my physical needs, but my emotional needs, my intellectual needs, my relational needs, spiritual needs. All of those needs, I am learning to meet consistently. And I am learning how to detect when those needs aren't being met. important. And you might need to ask somebody to help you as you figure out how to do that. Secondly, self-care always will involve an element of connection with myself and with at least one other person at a deep, caring, vulnerable level. That is, such an important piece of self-care. don't lose sight of that. Self-care, there's an element you can do all by yourself. Do it alone, but there's an element of connection that is always going to be needed because that is one of our needs. Next, part of self-care, especially the crisis stuff, when I am depleted, is I need to learn emotional regulation. I need to learn how to manage all of the stuff that's coming up because I am depleted. I'm irritable. I need to be able to manage that. I'm feeling some discontent. I need to learn how to sit in that. I'm feeling some anxiety and depression. I need to learn how to manage that. there's always going to be elements of self-regulation and learning healthy self-soothing that are part of self-care. Let me take it a wee bit deeper. To be able to take care of yourself in a healthy way means I need to put a higher priority on my own pleasure and enjoyment. Now to some people that immediately sounds wrong. That I am being proud, that I am being selfish, that I am being a narcissist. Not if it's healthy. Do you realize that you can't love others from an empty cup. if you're a narcissist, you can't love others from an empty cup. if you're not filling your own gas tanks, your own cup, you're never going to be able to love others properly.",

    "output": "Meanwhile, you're painted as the one who overreacted, disappeared, or refused to work things out. It's all about image. Are obsessed with how they appear to others. Being exposed for who they really are is their deepest fear. when you go no contact, not just because they lost access to you, but because they lose control of how they're perceived, you walking away creates a gap in their story. And they rush to fill it with lies, half-truths, or emotional manipulation. It's not enough for them to move on. They need to convince others that you were the problem. That you hurt them. That you left them with no choice. Sometimes it's not even what they say, but what they imply. They may post vague messages, quotes about betrayal, or videos about toxic people, strategically timed and carefully selected to make it seem they're healing from someone you. It's performance. Plain and simple. But it works. Because the people watching don't know what you endured. They weren't there for the gaslighting, the emotional roller coasters, or the slow erosion of your self-worth. when the narcissist cries victim, people listen. And it's not just about damaging your image to others. It's also about damaging how you see yourself. Narcissists want you to hear the rumors, feel the sting of false judgment, and start to question your own reality. They want you to feel isolated, misunderstood, punished. Opens the door to doubt. Maybe I was too harsh. Maybe I should have handled it differently. That internal conflict is exactly what they need to pull you back in or keep you small. Even worse, they may try to discredit your truth before you even speak it. If you try to explain what happened, they'll accuse you of exaggerating, being bitter, or holding a grudge. They'll say things , trying to make me look bad. Or, they've always had issues with communication. This isn't just defensive behavior. It's tactical. Silencing you before you find your voice. Some narcissists go even further by using shared connections to deliver passive, aggressive messages. Mentally. Let something slip to a friend, knowing it'll make its way back to you. Or they'll reach out to someone close to you and pretend to be concerned about your -being. These aren't acts of care. They're strategies of control. They want to remind you they're still in your orbit.",

You must be able to have a break. You must be able to ask for help when you need it. You must be able to express how you feel. You must take time for yourself. There must be times in your life which is just for you. that we have to find ways amidst the role of caregivers to actually care for the person here. Because if we don't, the result is burnout. And illness. again, it's not a question of being selfish and unconcerned. That's not good either for your health. But it's a question of being as kind to yourself as you are wanting to be to others. It's kind of the golden rule turned around. Do unto you. Not just do unto others what you would have them do to you, but also do unto yourself what you wish to do to others. Any questions on what I've said. Yes please. , addiction is something a bit different. It happens when we're stressed and we need to soothe ourselves. when we allow all the stress to wash over us, and we don't keep the stress away, then we get overwhelmed. Then one way to deal with the stress is to become addicted. that, it's very interesting when you look at families with addictions, you also see a lot of illness in other members. they just represent different coping styles. The addict soothes themselves through the addictive behavior. The person with who doesn't go to addiction, they're good, they're going to go suppress themselves and develop illness instead. There's a question here,. That's what I was going to ask you about. The person that has an addiction problem, I've seen this in quite a bit of people. They quit using their alcohol. And then afterwards they become really sober for over a year or something, then they become chronically ill. , what, let me give you the mic that people can hear you. It's a good question. Thank you. People with addictions, maybe alcohol,. they've been using alcohol to help themselves to self-medicate, but after that they stop using alcohol and knowing that their mental and emotional development isn't to par, they become chronically ill.",
