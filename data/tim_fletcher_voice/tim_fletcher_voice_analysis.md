## Sample Analogies & Metaphors
Tim's way of explaining complex concepts:

- So imagine that you were going to  your friends place and they've asked you to stay overnight
- So think of tying their shoes,  riding a bike, learning to read arithmetic, learning to add and subtract
- It's like a muscle where you  go to the gym and you add weight to that muscle
- Many people when they think of complex trauma,  they think about what was done to you
- But think of it lost control this way
- And they just feel very much like an infant again, helpless to do anything for themselves
- So I want  you to think of two examples and again see it through the eyes of your children
- So you imagine Joseph's hearing his brother  saying this, they're planning to kill him
- Can you imagine all of that, what that would have  brought up inside of Joseph
- And once we find an activity or a chemical that gives the brain  chemicals that feel like attachment, we go, I think I found a solution

## Sample Examples
How Tim illustrates points with examples:

- Let's say that you go to  an airport and you have to go to the washroom or a sporting event and you have  to go to a washroom and there's all kinds of people in the bathroom
- Think back to bodily  sensations, emotions that you felt
- So let's say you just turn 50
- Or let's say your child gets married
- Or let's say your child moves away from home
- Let's say a child grows up in a home where some days when  they cry somebody comes and picks them up and meets their need and comforts them so they get a  very good response
- So for example, you might have had a parent who met your physical needs so well
- So let's say this child who can set a complex trauma now is you  as an adult and you are going through a change
- But let's say again what happens inside of you when fear of change is triggered
- Let's say that you're single parenting right now
