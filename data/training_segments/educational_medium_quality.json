These are essential brain circuits for such feelings. Nature gave them those for a reason. Allow the child to experience them. That way they can stay connected to themselves. Thirdly, there's a need for spontaneous free play out in nature. Get the hell away from these devices. Don't give a one-year-old an iPad or a cell phone. Get rid of the screens in your house when your kids are small. Have a screen in a locked room for yourself if you need one. But don't be phoning and texting and emailing around your kid. Because the message they get is the device is more important than they are. Don't go for a walk with them and texting and looking at your cell at the same time. Don't give the kids these devices. They've been documentably shown to interfere with the healthy development of brain circuits. This has been shown on brain scans. if I was raising kids today, I wouldn't let them near a screen for years. On the other hand, I would encourage them to be outdoors, be with them, play in nature, spontaneous creative play. , these are the essential needs of children. I talk about them in this book. They're difficult to provide in this culture. Because if you do any of this stuff, you'll be an outlier. Because all your friends and all your kids' friends' parents will be on their cell phones all the time. you have to make a decision not to buy into the false values of this, what I call this toxic culture. that's some basic advice, , easily said, hard to achieve, but at least these are the goals that we need to be striving for. I wish I had known this stuff when my kids were small. That's it.",

    "text": "let us be still an instant and forget all things we ever learned, all thoughts we had. And every preconception that we hold of what things mean and what their purpose is. , today I'd to read to you and comment on some brief quotes from A Course in Miracles. A few years ago I gave a talk about A Course in Miracles in a little bit more detail. A Course in Miracles, I don't know if you have read it or done it or heard of it. It's a channeled book. First channeled in the 60s, later part of the 60s. And first published. It was published in 70, probably 76. And it's been around since then, become a kind of spiritual classic. It's one of the few channeled books that are deep and quite profound. It's not for everybody, definitely. It uses Christian terminology. But. Reinterprets Christianity. that it becomes a very deep teaching. Perhaps that's the original teaching of Jesus. It was channeled by a psychologist, clinical psychologist at Columbia University in New York. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. She didn't understand the content very. Having little spiritual background. it was dictated to her by an inner voice. The Christian terminology is helpful to some people and a hindrance for others. It uses this old-fashioned language. It uses this old-fashioned language. with exclusively masculine pronouns and God the Father and he's talking about God as he. That may be considered a limitation but you can look beyond that. Today I would to, instead of using the entire course here, which is a big book, I don't even have it here. This book was published just a little volume here of quotes from the Course in Miracles and it's called Accept This Gift, Selections from a Course in Miracles. Forward by Marianne Williamson. Published by Tarcher Cornerstone Editions. And the quotes are quite very short and beautiful and they selected also quotes that are relatively neutral in their language you don't get a lot of the masculine pronouns and old-fashioned terminology. what I will do today is just select. Just select a few of these very brief quotes and comment on them. This does not mean I'm simplifying the Course in Miracles or reducing it to something simple.",

    "text": ", somewhere else in the Course it uses the ancient expression, know thyself, as one of the main purposes of the Course is to teach you to know yourself. Know thyself. Don't know if I can find it. And it doesn't matter. How does it matter. How does that relate to a time will come when you will realize that not what you are. How can yourself. And then it says time will come when you, as a positive thing, that not what you are. , that's easily explained. To know yourself, you have to let go of concepts about yourself. When you let go of concepts, mentally held concepts about yourself, then you no longer know who or what you are on the level of concept. And when you have then let go of concepts, where concepts of the self have been laid by, let go of, is truth revealed exactly as it is. when you surrender mental concepts, about who you are, which is stories, narratives, interpretations, then another dimension of knowing arises, which is deeper or higher, it doesn't matter what term you use, then concepts. And instead of conceptual knowledge, which you let go of, a deeper dimension of knowing arises. And in that deeper dimension of knowing that is not conceptual, it's not based on thinking, the truth of who you are reveals itself. That's the essence of all, whether you look at Indian or, , Hindu teachings, Buddhist teachings, mystical Christianity, it's all the same. Sufism. Now let's carry on with this poem on the same theme. I call it poem, it's just part of the text. Let us be still an instant and forget all things we ever learned, all thoughts we had, and every preconception that we hold of what things mean and what their purpose is. Let us remember not our own ideas of what the world is for. We do not know. Let every image held of everyone be loosened from our minds and swept away. Be innocent of judgment. Unaware of any thoughts of evil or of good that ever crossed your mind of anyone. Now do him not. But you are free to learn of him and learn of him anew. Him being any other person. this section here points to, the clarity that comes, the deep realization that comes when you, let go of thinking basically.",

But it's actually kind of. many research stories, it becomes sort of a dull necessity as a mother kind of a thing. I was a brand new professor at Cal State LA. And working on other people's research. And there were labs around the city. And the student research assistants would come back. And over a series of weeks, they would just come back, , , really with the sort of , , rubbing the temples. And I was , what's going on. And they kept describing these patients who pretty much monopolized the run of the clinic. They were entitled. They were rude to the receptionist. They were rude to the nurses. They were rude to the research assistants. They were demanding. They were difficult, difficult people. Now, what's the word that came to mind. It was difficult. It was enough that these research assistants were feeling , oh, I don't want to do this anymore. Which made me wonder, would the other health professionals want to step back. And honestly, how much of a sort of. Healthcare toll these people were taking. Was everyone getting poorer care because the healthcare professionals were burned out at dealing with this small handful of difficult patients. That led me to start a program of research looking at personality and health. Health behaviors, perceptions of health, self-protection and health. And with a real focus on these sort of rigid, maladaptive personality styles narcissism to see what would come out of it. And I looked at personality, personality disorders. And I looked at the whole nine yards. But simultaneous to that, I also, about maybe five years later, my private practice was really coming up in earnest. I was doing all this research on narcissism. And I was talking to people who kind of kept telling me the same relationship story. They were being invalidated. They always wondered what they were doing wrong, saying wrong. They were being gaslighted, but we weren't even using the term as much then. And. Sorry, it was a new term for me 10 years ago. It wasn't part of my training.

I want to bring hope to those who are feeling life has been pretty hopeless lately. the format of this lecture is going to be I'm first going to briefly discuss all how the brain and body and nervous system get disrupted due to betrayal trauma. Then I'm going to explain Dr. Stephen Porges is polyvagal theory, and then how you can apply the model to your everyday healing practices to either down regulate if you're very hyper vigilant, anxious, stressed, or up regulated if you tend to be someone who's more shut down, dissociated, can't get out of bed, can't, , get one thought out straight, etc. And most importantly, return some agency, choice control back to your life again.",

They stood up for you against someone who was going to hurt you maybe or they taught you how to protect yourself to fight or they pulled you back from a choice you made or were about to make to go down some destructive path. That person brought some good into the world. just take a moment to acknowledge a time or two when this happened for your benefit. All next I'd you to think of someone who taught you a skill that helped you earn money. Being able to earn money is such a gift. Was it someone who taught you to use a computer or drive a car. Did they help you be a good writer or a good builder or to be good at cleaning. To be a great leader. To be good at caring for other people. Maybe to do something clinical. for others, to do research, to cook, to be of service to others, whatever has allowed you to earn money and eat and keep a roof over your head, give thanks for a moment to the person who taught you how to do that. You weren't born knowing that, they taught you and they brought good into the world in this way. now think of someone who modeled for you how to be a good and moral person and none of us are born with that knowledge but we learn it from the people around us. Even if some of the people around us were doing bad things, there were other people in our midst, neighbors, teachers, friends, even characters on tv shows were modeling for us how to navigate in the world and how to act with honor and courage and kindness. Can you think of someone who modeled that for you in a way that impacted who you became. Let's give them a moment of your silent appreciation for bringing good into the world. Has there been someone who helped you get organized when life was overwhelming.",

Now last year I started really tuning in to the pattern I was hearing in many of the letters that people were writing to me where their parents didn't listen to them or really see them. And that kind of treatment and then the kind of problems they were having now as adults in connecting with people and expressing themselves. And I made a video at the time that just went viral fast. many people related to it. I'm bringing it back from the archives for you now that you can see if you show signs that this happened to you. If you tend to go into a stress response when you try to communicate your emotions or what you need, it may be that you're showing the signs that you weren't listening. If you're showing the signs that you weren't listening, you're showing the signs that you weren't listening. If you're showing the signs that you weren't listening, you're showing the signs that you weren't listening. If you're showing the signs that you weren't listening, you're showing the signs that you weren't listening, you're showing the signs that you weren't listening. when you're trying to communicate your emotions, you're showing the signs that you weren't listening. When you needed something, when you tried to stand up for yourself, when you tried to set a little kid's boundary, getting ignored and having to figure out everything by yourself as a child, it affects a person. And kids are supposed to learn how to be in the world from their parents. Parents are supposed to model it and teach it, how to speak, how to listen, how to interpret other people's actions. And parents are supposed to help their child learn how to express themselves in a way that works, that gets heard, that's clear, that's polite, that's assertive when it needs to be, , to say what they need,. To ask questions when they're confused, or to say no when something crosses their boundaries. Did you learn that at home. There's a whole lot I didn't learn until much later in my life, how it's supposed to work. , attentive parents are very connected to the kid. They listen and they coach them.",

And if the relationship is not healthy, then it's very beneficial for the person to either require it become healthy by getting an agreement from the person they're in a relationship with, or to leave that relationship and find other relationships. And for some people, that's going to be easier for them to do with maybe not their closest relationships, start there and start to build healthy relationships around them. And then maybe tackle that most central relationship, which can be very scary to start with that one. That's true. Great. Yes. What are other thoughts you have on ways that people can sort of get ahead, if you will, or at least use the understanding of betrayal blindness to inform them as they go forward into other relationships or manage the relationships in their lives. , looking for signs that the person themselves might be using betrayal blindness, , asking themselves, am I safe in this relationship.

And the perception delay usually makes us go to a big place where we're convinced we've done something wrong with our lives. And we're not seeing our own humanity. And we're not seeing our own identity. And it's not true. We're convinced we're the only one with problems. We can be convinced that speaking up is wrong or dangerous or even lame. We can be convinced that everyone is doing much better than us when maybe that's not true. We can be convinced that we're the only one with problems. We can be convinced that we're the problem. Can you see the perception delays as something that those are childlike. And you probably identify with some of those yourself. And you may also really know people in your adult life who might behave from that, as , or think from that place as. Childlike, not childish. Childlike because they got stuck in childhood. Again, and that's not a moral failing. survivors can view themselves as a horrible person when they're not. And they can also view others as angelic when that's not maybe true either. helping out an inner child with the perception delay, which will also involve some critical thinking from the inner adult, is helped when the inner adult has some resources to bounce questions off of, such as with the therapist or with a fellow survivor. What I mean by that is , I'm feeling this was done on purpose. Can I run that by you about something that somebody did. Or, , such as also going to that person and kind of saying, am I totally defective or did I make a mistake. Are all humans predators or do I project and look for evidence that they're all predators. Again, did they do that on purpose or does my inner child live in people's bad intentions and only look for that. additionally, while fact-checking and bouncing things off of somebody, it sounds kind of cognitive and almost cognitive behavioral therapy where we check out our assumptions. Childhood trauma survivors need something deeper than that, processing where these assumptions come from in childhood trauma.",

And this is where something called the polyvagal theory or the understanding, I should say, of how the vagus nerve works and how it relates with the parasympathetic nervous system comes into play. I've done an entire lecture on these vagus connections, vlogs on it. we can pop in one where I talk about what the polyvagal theory is. And I did a special topic lecture just on this. The polyvagal theory is not just about the vagus nerve. This is the other thing. It is about how we as humans interact with our physiology and the environment in a hierarchical fashion, depending on the stress and situation at hand. If I'm having a nice, chill moment with you guys, or you have a group around a campfire, one would hope that I'm in a more slow down, easy, chill, rest, digest, socially engaged mode. If I am under threat or under attack, I'm going to come out of that chill mode. And I'm going to go into more sympathetic fight flight mode. If I can't fight or flee, and I'm , I give up, I can't get out of this sticky, tricky situation, my system goes into what we might call a rest and digest mode. And I'm going to go into a more sympathetic fight flight mode. And that one is a shift. That's what I call a freeze, or a shutdown, or a collapse. Which is part of the parasympathetic. the parasympathetic's complexity is this concept of polyvagal. And it is nothing more. I mean, it's a big deal. But it's this concept of these different spectrums and different systems that our neurophysiology and our neurochemistry have to cascade through when we are safe and feeling good and warm and fuzzy, or when we are not and we are needing to create change. I think that's an important question. to go into protection mode. the parasympathetic is got, it has more nuance. I'll leave it at that.

It's not some fancy breath thing where you breathe. It's not some fancy pushing of the muscles to get a shaking. It's starting with listening to these basic autonomic biological functions that are in our system.

And sometimes the patience is a little bit of tough love.

You asked, I've heard that certain body parts can be in freeze while other body parts aren't. And to me, that's just fascinating. Yes, it is. how do we unfreeze those frozen body parts by feeling them fully and seeing what's there and letting whatever wants to come up and out as Irene says. For me, for example, it's the lower abdomen and my feet. here's, yes. yes, sometimes if we have an accident, one area will be more dissociated.

That's just related to this body part. Milika, it comes back to working with the whole system. And then when you become more tuned to how to listen to your system, and , for instance, that the freeze is more in your abdomen, you might use more intention, more touch, more movement.

We, the military, explain for these responsibilities, in relation to the threat, what are the needs we have. In terms of equipment, in terms of personnel. Then the decision makers decide. And if they decide that we must not defend ourselves, that we must do something else, we will do what we are told. that's also something quite easy in the system.

The Department of Defense, the Defense of the Protection of the Population and Sports, the DDPS of its little name, is this masterful. With the data available online, we tried to make it the difficult organigram. With 12,279 employees, it is by far the most supplied department of the Confederation. It supervises the army, but also the quantity of other offices, such as the armament, Swiss weapons, or the intelligence service. At the beginning of this year, the DDPS is completely decapitated. On January 15, the federal advisor Viola Amert announced her resignation six years after taking the direction of the DDPS. On February 21, it is Peter Mertz, the head of the air force, who leaves. On February 25, the press reports a double resignation. It is the head of the army, Thomas Sussly, who leaves, as the head of the intelligence service, Christian Ducey. And then the next day, it is a gigantic case of presumed fraud and corruption that breaks through RUAG, the armament company in the hands of the Confederation. There, we hit the bottom. In a way, the DDPS has imploded at that moment. I wrote it in a comment. The situation is explosive. RUAG's reputation is ruined. And above the market, the top officials resign.

We learn that the current radar system, Floraco, has taken such a blow that only the employees themselves, who are aging, have the necessary know-how to manage it. Problems. These experts will soon retire without being able to form their own companies. The new employees have resigned, discouraged. The audit denounces a calamitous management. Other resignations are not to be excluded due to the climate of dissatisfaction that reigns in the team. There is a high danger for operational exploitation if personnel erosion continues. The governance of the project is marked by a conflictual environment and a lack of confidence. We are talking about a layer of limon. This layer would prevent problems from rising towards the hierarchy. This report is the reflection of the moment when we really put the problems on the table. What comes out is quite serious. It shows the problems caused by the frictions within the administration. But now that everything has been put on the table, there is the possibility of reorganizing this project in a way that it is realized without these tensions, which are damaging. Because in the end, the objective is to ensure that the air forces remain really operational. It turned out that the complexity of this project has been massively underestimated. It is obviously very ugly. In addition, it turned out that the complexity of this project has been greatly underestimated.

Her path demonstrates that human resistance power, even the deepest hell, can survive. Elisabeth's transformation from a prisoner to the guardian of her family is a proof of the indestructible human will. Her children, who had to learn what it means to be free, show us that healing is possible, even if the scars remain. The economic perspective in this case reveals another dimension of abuse. Fritzl's total control over financial resources was a way of making a significant contribution to his power. The current financial independence of the survivors therefore symbolizes not only economic stability, but also their final victory over the mechanisms of their suppression. They have regained the economy of their lives. What can we learn from this story. That we as a society must be more vigilant, that bureaucracy must never be over humanity, that we must give a voice to the weak, and that even in the deepest darkness hope is not lost. The case of Fritzl is a painful but necessary reminder of our responsibility for each other and the invincible power of the human spirit, which can even survive the worst nightmares.

The problem is complex trauma for a child is they get cortisol, and they get really angry and afraid, and they want to fight or flight, but they're too little to run away, and they're too little to fight. the brain is going, , that option didn't work. now what do I do. they go to the third option, which is freeze. And that's where the brain now does a different chemical. The brain releases actual natural opioids in the brain. And that's where the brain now does a different chemical. And that's where the brain now does a different chemical. And that's where the brain releases actual natural opioids in the brain. And fight or flight cortisol basically is I'm going to escape into my outside world. I'm going to go external solution. But if that's not working, what opioids basically do is I'm going to retreat into an internal world that I create that's safe for myself. That's dissociation, basically. But to take it further, cortisol, it puts blood into the extremity. And the muscles in the extremity, you can run faster, etc. But extra sugar into the blood. Opioids, they bring all the blood from the extremities around the heart. And basically, it is saying, let's get prepared to get hurt and cut, that we don't bleed as much. And we don't feel pain.",

And what happens for people with drug and alcohol addictions is they give up the drug and alcohol.

And we need parents when we have a need and we're dysregulated because of that need. We have a thirst to meet that need. We need a parent who's regulated to come in and meet the need and to soothe us. And that means they got to connect with us and be safe. But if I don't have that, then I don't get soothed.

But it settles. It settles them down for a little bit, but it actually makes things worse in the end. It's settling their limbic brain down, but there's going to be consequences down the road that they don't even see at that point.

And what does that mean. And what does that mean vis-a-vis implications for the field as a whole. And can you just talk a little bit about that. That's remarkable to me. it's disturbing for people, and they're reluctant to really take in the possibility that the field of modern psychology and to a great extent the field of psychiatry are founded on a really unhealthy set of principles almost from the beginning.

And in Ephesus, I mean, you had all kinds of challenges facing the church. They had tons of idol worship and paganism. They had false teaching. Even in the Bible, they had false teaching. They had false teaching. They had false teaching. They had false teaching. They were wrestling with the church that they were wrestling with. And, of course, they were dealing with persecution because they were Jesus' followers. And Paul tells his son, his spiritual son, his protege, if you will, Timothy, just one chapter earlier from where we were in 2 Timothy, look at chapter 2, verse 15. He's telling Timothy, be a good worker, one who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly explains the word of truth. Or if you have a King James Version. It says, the one who rightly divides the word of truth. what are we talking about. What does that mean. It means that we don't just take the Bible and just read verses at random and just come up with some off-the-cuff meanings and applications and it's just whatever you see, just go for it. That's not what we do. We study Scripture. We read the Bible through the lens of Jesus. And if we don't explain it or unpack it. Or teach it, learn it, or rightly divide it, then we can end up misunderstanding what God is saying. But when we take into account all of what Scripture says, not just random verse here and there, but what we call the whole counsel of Scripture, and we take into account what Jesus says to us about God and about who He is and what He's doing in this world, when we take all of that into account, we can end up misunderstanding what God is saying. We take all of that into account. We can have confidence in what God is saying in His word, what we're reading. Now, Jonah, he didn't have the New Testament.

I did not come to abolish or to get rid of or to destroy or to just wipe away. I did not come to abolish the law of Moses or the writings of the prophets. No, I came to accomplish their purpose or to fulfill their purpose. See, when Jesus went to the cross, He was not just a prophet. He was a prophet of the prophets. He was a prophet of the prophets. He was the final sacrifice that He bore the penalty for sin and for death and all of the junk that's in our lives. Up until that point, they had a sacrificial system of sacrificing animals, and they had to continually do that, regular basis, always sacrificing in the temple. But when Jesus came, He was the final Lamb of God. And what happened is we had a covenant shift. He brought us into what we call the covenant of grace or the new covenant.

There are different causes for ADHS. There is a large proportion of genetic factors. But alcohol and smoking in pregnancy also increase the risk, as they can negatively affect brain development in the mother's body. For over 30 years, the psychiatrist Ralph Myers has been treating children and adults with a deficit of attention. It sounds paradoxical, but he is optimistic that the brain can learn better with the drugs, that at some point you no longer need the drugs. Once ADHS does not always mean ADHS. If you walk through the area half blind, half deaf, then a glasses and a hearing aid will logically help you. If you walk completely unconcentrated through the area and you get a drug that produces the concentration now, then you get information that your brain can start with and then expand its capabilities. And when I learned that, I need less and less of this support. Ralph Myers is taking a test developed in Sweden for diagnosis. He measures attention, impulse control and concentration. And that even works on the phone. Progresses in treatment can be measured and controlled easily. What is the most important thing for you.",

The scapegoat is the person that gets the wrath of the narcissistic parent or parents or other narcissistic extended family members. They are the ones that bear the brunt of the gaslighting, the invalidation, the rage, they're blamed for everything, the rest is the person that gets the brunt of the gaslighting, the rage, they're blamed for everything and scapegoats often have a childhood characterized by walking every day on eggshells. again as you think about if this is you, what are the things that you experienced in childhood.",

Your brain hates being bored, while you're laying there it's going to pull up all sorts of random ideas and think about everything when you're trying to sleep. With anxiety, worries keep the body's sympathetic state active, that fight-flight-freeze response, and those racing thoughts, that preventative worrying, keeps you on high alert. Now there are tons more of overlapping behaviors, but you get the idea,. ADHD and anxiety can look very similar on the surface, but the symptoms are rooted in two very different functions in the brain. what's the fundamental root difference between ADHD and anxiety. It's executive function. executive function is the brain's ability to manage thoughts and emotions and actions to reach a goal. It includes skills planning, focusing attention, and self- versteem. The brain's ability to respond to potential problems and challenges. The brain's ability to do direct and proactive actions, and focus on the FORCE of the day and the FUTURE of the day.",

It does not matter because they're tightly grouped here. One of the things that we often see with ADHD is someone might have the exact same IQ score, 110. But their processing speed is 130. It's super fast. And their working memory is. It's super fast. It's 90, just under average. it's not a problem. It's not their processing speed is that bad. The problem is they have a much bigger gap, 40 points between their processing speed and their working memory. As Russell Barkley says, that's a race car engine with bicycle brakes. And these gaps in mental skills are pretty typical with ADHD. a common pattern of cognitive profile scatter with ADHD is high processing speed and low working memory. a common pattern of cognitive profile scatter with ADHD is high processing speed and low working memory. a common pattern of cognitive profile scatter with ADHD is high processing speed and low working memory. Working memory is how many things you can hold in your attention at once. It helps you hold and sort through thoughts. , I'm feeling anxious because I have a deadline. But I've done this before. That's two thoughts in your head at once. Hold those in your head while trying to remember your system, pull out your calendar, and pretty soon the ADHD brain will give up. It's it has less capacity to hold multiple ideas in its head at once. Working memory is also really essential for holding emotional information. It's you could compare this to past experiences. That requires you to hold your memory in one hand and your current experience in the other and be , oh, I've done this before. It's. In ADHD, working memory is often impaired, which makes it harder to pause and think before reacting emotionally. And does executive dysfunction,. Impulse control. This can lead to impulsive emotional outbursts or difficulty calming down. A slower working memory is a slow-moving memory. A slower working memory also inhibits your overall executive function.",

Thereby, as I put it before, promoting him, alleviating it to reach out to attain this potential and to fulfill and thereby actualize also himself, but not by preaching. Exactly. Self-actualization. It's nonsense. Self-actualization can only fall into your lap automatically once that you have fulfilled a concrete meaning, done the best of a situation. Then you actualize yourself as a byproduct. Let's talk about the third set of values, which is the attitudinal. The idea of choosing how to respond to suffering. Choosing the attitude. The attitude. Yes. Yes. If there is no possibility in a given situation to fulfill the meaning of a situation by giving oneself to the experience of beauty and forth, nor if you have lost the capability to do your job, to do your work, even then, there is an ultimate possibility to find and fulfill meaning.

You stand there, you stood there naked with nothing you could have had. But all the more what counted and mattered was what you were. Yes. Yes. Being rather than having, possessing anything or the being. what counted was what you make out of this situation. With what attitude you adopt in the given situation.

Perhaps a little fireballวยые any or pointing out how cruel it is that you're ignoring them after all they've done for you. And if neither of those work, they might escalate into rage. Because for a narcissist, panic quickly curdles into anger when their attempts fail. But what you need to understand is that all of this behavior, every late night text, every manufactured emergency, every rumor spread through mutual friends, isn't evidence of your weakness. It's evidence of your strength. Your silence is working. Your boundary is holding. And their panic is proof that you've disrupted their pattern. There's a larger philosophical truth here too. Panic reveals where someone places their identity. If your sense of self is built on authentic connection, on mutual respect, then when someone places their identity, someone walks away, you feel sadness, maybe grief, but not panic. Panic belongs to those whose sense of self is fragile, whose identity depends entirely on external validation. And that's the tragic reality of a narcissist. But their panic is not just about losing you. It's about losing the illusion that someone else will always be there to keep them from facing the emptiness inside. what happens if you're in a situation where you feel you're in a situation where you're not. If you stay strong and maintain no contact, the panic grows louder at first. They'll test every weak spot, trying to find the crack in your armor. But that over time, as their strategies fail, the panic begins to transform. It becomes bitterness, anger, denial. And eventually, it forces them into the next stage, where they start lashing out or pretending you never mattered. But make no mistake, that shift doesn't end. It doesn't mean you failed. It means your silence has carried them through the full spectrum of their dependency on you. And now they're scrambling for another source of supply. And here's what's most empowering about all of this. Every moment you hold your boundary, you're teaching yourself something just as important as you're teaching them. You're learning that their panic is not your responsibility.",

A good example, a painful example of family mobbing from one of my past videos. Honestly, I'm shocked by how often this comes up with not just my clients, but in all the research I've done on FSA. Going to a funeral, typically a parent's funeral, and literally being attacked by siblings, sometimes by a parent. Horrible things said to you, accusations made. It's devastating and confusing. Part of that is with the death of the parent, the homeostasis, or the, it may be an unhealthy balance, but the balance that the families had all these years with everyone in their role, and the family chugging along, that changes and changes drastically, and sometimes suddenly with the death of a parent, especially if the parent was very influential in the family. everyone's kind of spinning out, and what can happen, a tornado, all the siblings kind of start spinning together a tornado, and comes your way at the funeral and knocks you down. It is really something to be proud of. And to behold, as a clinician hearing about these events, it's heartbreaking, angering also, because I have a client who's suffering from the loss of a parent, or even if they were in no contact, there's unfinished business, there's a sense there'll never be closure. All kinds of feelings are coming up, and they use every ounce of courage they have if they choose to go to the funeral. I never tell a client what to do in those cases. I encourage them to work with me to sort through what the best decision is for them, short-term, long-term, and for their nervous system. And some choose to go to the funerals, and it takes much courage, and then they just get whammed by this force of the sibling tornado. You stole this from mom, or dad never loved you. These things are actually sad. I have very believable clients and believable people partaking in my research. Many are therapists themselves. It's just no reason for them to lie to me.

    "text": "One of the big focuses of my work has been what's happening to someone when they're stressed, when they're afraid, when they're terrified. And that can be when someone is just suddenly realizing that they're being betrayed by a boss they thought cared about them and was nurturing their career, and now suddenly they're treating them as an object. evolution shaped our brains to have certain responses to danger, to have responses to being attacked, whether it's by a predator that wants to eat us or whether it's by a sexual predator who wants to do things to our body that we don't want done. And one of the ways that we can understand this is that we have a circuitry of our brain. We call it the defense circuitry in neuroscience. And it's a circuitry that's always scanning for danger, and when it detects danger or attack, it shifts how the rest of the brain is working. And one of the things it can do really quickly is shift how people's attention is working. And their attention becomes grabbed by parts of the experience that seem really crucial to coping and surviving or not jeopardizing that relationship or the danger to your career and those sorts of things. But it's very, , what we call bottom-up attention. Its attention is captured by things in the experience that are threatening. And one of the other things this defense circuitry does is it can very rapidly impair that reasoning part of our brain, this prefrontal cortex, this part that allows us to be rational and think things through and make good, sophisticated, flexible decisions. And when stress kicks in and when fear kicks in, within a couple of seconds, that part of our brain can become significantly impaired. And that's what we call the defense circuitry. And when stress kicks in and when fear kicks in, within a couple of seconds, that part of our brain can become significantly impaired. Sometimes basically taken offline. And when that happens, what do we fall back on. We tend to fall back on habits and reflexes and very simple decision-making processes that are not rational things we're thinking out a lot. And we fall back on habits how to deal with aggressive and dominant people that we've had to deal with in our lives.",

    "text": "And then finally, in terms of memory, there's these general principles of memory. , we're not going to remember everything that happens here. We remember things that we focus attention on. We remember things that are emotionally significant to us. And this gets dramatically amplified when that defense circuitry takes over, when we're under attack. And certain parts of the experience can get really burned in, and other parts that the person's not noticing or don't seem significant to them at the time, they're not getting encoded into their brain. And this we call differential encoding of what's happening. What really got attention, what was really scary and awful, versus the things that didn't get much attention and weren't that significant. This can account for people having memories afterwards that are very fragmentary. There's lots of pieces missing. And then another thing that can happen is at a certain stage, the brain can have trouble encoding the sequence of things. you may be taking in that awful sensation of being grabbed or squeezed or penetrated or the smell of whiskey on the person's breath or something. Something that. But at a certain point, you may not be taking in what sequence that happens. And in the case study, to ask someone to narrate something even forward, let alone in reverse, is going to set them up for inconsistencies in their memory. Or questioning someone about things that were peripheral details that they didn't even notice, you're going to create inconsistencies. And as an expert who works on these cases, I see over and over again, the inconsistencies in people's memories are caused by the investigators asking the wrong questions, pushing for information that is not available. And finally, another thing that really affects memory, the way stress can affect memory, is when people are trying to retrieve memories, when they're trying to recall, whether telling their friend or telling an investigator, stress impairs retrieval. And if you're interviewing with a police officer who isn't believing you, who is doubting you, who doesn't understand these principles of memories, who's asking you to do it in reverse, that's pretty stressful. It's stressful enough to talk to a police officer about these things. It's stressful enough to talk to a police officer about these horrible experiences.

    "text": "And I'd say, when you're sort of overall overwhelmed, let's start with yoga or Qigong or whatever makes sense to you in terms of how to move your body. And I'd probably do neurofeedback. What's neurofeedback. Neurofeedback is you hook your skull up to electrodes that can harvest the underlying brainwaves. you can produce, you can project your brain activity on a computer screen, and then you can play computer games with your own brainwaves to organize your brainwaves in a way that you can be more focused and pay more attention. I've got some, a graph up on the screen for anybody watching, and it shows five different types of brainwaves. Gamma brainwaves, which are very close brainwaves, beta less close, alpha less close, and then delta, which is when you're sort of sleeping, dreaming. The waves are very, very far apart, almost flat. looking at these different types of brainwaves, if we just categorize them from one being when the brainwaves are really tight and close to five, which is delta when they're really far apart, is one gamma, is that anxiety or something. No, no, anxiety is very focused thinking. , fine. But it depends on where it is. the back of your brain is supposed to have these slow, because your back of the brain is dealing with the housekeeping of your body. The back of your brain tells you have to breathe a little bit more, you have to go to the bathroom, you have to eat, you have to have bodily regulation. A very large part of your brain is about your body regulation, which gets messed up in a major way by trauma. for example, when you close your eyes, the back of your brain is supposed to develop nice, slow waves to tell you, I'm feeling peaceful. When you're traumatized, when they ask you to close your eyes, it is very likely that the back of your brain will get agitated and create much faster waves than you should. And you get a sense of agitation the moment you close your eyes, which is of course very detrimental to your health. my job then becomes how to train your brain that when you close your eyes, your back of your brain becomes very calm. For example. Again, this is not about trauma, it's about brain organization.",

Think in terms of how is your brain able to filter out irrelevant information. How is your brain able to be still and quiet. And how are you able to take on a task and complete it. How do I not raise a traumatized kid. That's all, because I'm going to have kids probably quite soon, hopefully. And I don't want to raise traumatized kids. Be sure to listen to people in your environment. Don't raise them by yourself. I think raising a kid by yourself, you'll keep the full brunt of your own pathology. it's very important for a kid to be raised by a number of people. the kid gets to see, oh, my dad is a little bit reactive, but my neighbor across the street is much calmer. And the kid gets to see, oh, my dad is a little bit reactive, but my neighbor across the street is much calmer. And the kid gets to see multiple perspectives, as all of us idealize African villages as people having many different parents who look after you. It takes a village. It takes a village. And I think kids need to be really part of a larger environment where they can see their parents as safe people, but also flawed people. And the more nuclear you get, the harder it gets to keep your pathology out of your kid's life, actually. community is everything. Also in terms of raising a child. Is there anything that you think is healing towards trauma, childhood trauma, all forms of trauma that we haven't talked about. , the critical issue is that trauma is about being helpless and not nobody coming to your rescue.

There's no research that shows. One is better than the other. Because women seem to have a sixth sense. And people joke about it in relationship context. But I genuinely feel women have a heightened sensitivity. And actually, when you look at some of the studies, for example, women can smell, I think it's testosterone, but men can't smell the same or certain hormones on women. from a physiological standpoint, women do seem to be more sensitive, especially to men. There's that study they did where they got T-shirts off men after they'd been for a run. And the women went down and smelt them. And then I think they had to guess which one was the most attractive.

But I hired on in 1978, but as early as 84, I was already teaching. And I love it when people get it and they see a behavior. They understand the underpinnings, the foundation of why we do certain things. I'll give you an example. Sometimes you'll come to a horrible scene and people immediately gasp. They take in air and then they cover their mouths. Or there's one point difference on the scoreboard and people are this and they don't understand. This is back where we were surrounded by lions and tigers and we learned to cover our mouths as not to broadcast our breath that they couldn't see where we were. They're trying to find us.

That's where storytelling in part came from, where we came and said, , I chased it. I was able to attack me, then I attacked back. And then we go through that whole storytelling, which has mythical proportions and mythical aspects as archetypes. And if you subscribe to Jungian psychology, one of the arguments that I always use is this. How many of you have been in an argument, and then 30 minutes later, you remember all the clever lines you should have said. We all have. And that's because the emotional brain hijacks neural activity. If you want the best out of people, if you want the best out of a relationship, vent that, get that out. Give it time,. And yes, you're going to have to invest that time, and then move forward that you can deal with the transactional, the business and forth. You've referenced a few times different types of body language that I've exhibited that help you understand what I'm thinking and going through. I think a second ago you referenced a globular. And this brings me to something I read in your work, about eyebrow knitting. What is eyebrow knitting. this little area between your eyes is called the glabella. And the glabella is great because at about, , I've seen it in babies as early as three or four days, but very early on we begin to furrow. In other words, we push this together when we have doubts or we don't something, or we don't understand something. we furrow the glabella. Some people call it eyebrow knitting because we have nicer eyebrows nowadays, not bushy the old days. They don't come together they used to. a lot of those expressions of I don't understand, we use with the squinted eyes, the furrowed glabella. Sometimes we'll touch our face or scratch our face. Babies at 47 seconds, which I have directly observed, if you shine a light at a newborn baby, it will furrow the chin that they don't it. And in my presentations I have a matching one of a 47-year-old man and a 47-second-old baby. Both doing the same thing when they hear things they don't.",

    "text": "we begin to communicate quite a lot actually with our faces. What about eyelid touching. for a long time, including in some of my writing, the theory was a lot of people cover their eyes, touch their eyes when they hear bad news. You said, hey, Joe, can you help me move this weekend. Oh, geez, Steve. You see a lot of that. And I started to think about that about five or six years ago. And I took some classes in anatomy, human anatomy. And I'm pretty much convinced now that a lot of the facial touching, including the touching of the eyes and forth, has to do with the innervation of the fifth crown, the cranial nerve, and the seventh cranial nerve. Now, some of your viewers may find this interesting. That nerve, which goes to our forehead and actually goes into our eyelids and forth, and the seventh, which is the facial, is very short in distance to that part of the brain where it is received. And I think, , I postulated, I wrote for Psychology Today, that a lot of the reasons why we touch our face and why we touch our eyes, oh, no, is because that pressure immediately goes to the brain and helps to relieve stress. And because the nerve is short, , we could massage our feet and achieve the same, but it's very far away. I think a lot of facial touching, including eye touching, we do because of its ability to, anytime there's stress, we pacify ourselves. And by the way, it's very interesting. In 1974, I was bored at the university, there was a lab where you could actually watch children and study them at play. And they had some children there that were born blind, they had never seen. And I was just blown away the first time I saw a blind child who had never seen, heard some news that was not very good, and immediately covered their eyes, having never seen. And that's when I realized, , we are 2. 4 million years old. This is hardwired in our DNA. This is part of our paleo circuits, as Dr. David Givens later taught me. And it has to do with how it feels. And that's why we touch our faces much. it's typically a negative emotion and a form of self-soothing for that negative emotion.",

You're going to have executives that you don't say, no, no, no. No. No. Now that sounds a complete sentence. No. No. That's not how it's going to work. And it's always lower. we work on the words.

You don't want to look a clown, but you want to have the space that you're entitled to. And then I think it's very important to learn to speak in cadence. When you speak in cadence, and I do it, is people listen. They have time to process what you're saying, but they can also attach the emotion that goes with it. Who spoke in cadence. Churchill. Martin Luther King. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up, live out the true meaning of its creed. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal. Powerful. Imagine if he stood up there and said, I have one dream that one day might. It's , who would listen to that. But he was a preacher, and he knew how to command an audience. And when Churchill said, we will fight them in the air, we will fight them on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills, we shall never surrender. The cadence is. Not just seductive, it is powerful. And a lot of executives don't know how to use it. They just. I've been to presentations where people just let go. They're not even listening to what's being said. And yet somebody begins to talk to them in cadence and says, this is our offer. It is not final, but for the moment it is our best offer.

A university can teach you how to think, but it doesn't teach you mastery. is this because I'm hearing obviously learning in the pursuit of knowledge.

How has it changed you as a human being. How has it shifted your perception of human behavior and what it is to be a human and meaning and all of these bigger questions of life.

It's fascinating, isn't it. Oh , oh. And it goes both ways. It goes both ways. And for example, if you have been molested as a kid, you're likely to have problems with touch. One of the most, maybe the most comforting thing in life is to be touched, to be held throughout life basically. But if you're afraid of touch, you live in an untouched body, you live in an unloved body and maybe, and I really take it very seriously with my patients who I always, almost always send to body people, body workers, you need to learn the pleasure of being touched, the safety of being touched. But as long as you're afraid of human touch and comfort, your mind cannot really get better in some ways. This is fascinating. in my second book, The Stress Solution, I wrote a whole chapter on touch and it was heavily influenced by Professor Francis McGlone at the University of Liverpool, who's done incredible work on touch and how we have these CT afferent nerve fibers and when they're stroked, it goes all the way to the kind of primitive parts of the brain, the lowest stress levels, cortisol. And I remember when we put that episode out that I recorded with him and when the book came out, some people go on and say, , look, I understand that human touch, effective, consensual, wanted human touch can be very, very beneficial, but I don't to be touched.

As you say. I can't remember how I felt, but I know I felt different. I just thought, I was literally mesmerized afterwards. And I don't know if it was possible to measure certain things in my body,.

But I can't prove that. What comes to my mind is that the moment that our current president of America said, I would not run for re-election, I wish I had a physiological measurement of people in America. And I think our biology changed at that moment because up to then we had a choice in the next election, be a demented person and a psychopath. And we were all in a state of despair. And then we had new candidates who looked really bright and optimistic. And my whole system has changed because the future no longer is between a demented person and a psychopath.

And you got a sense of hope. And that is such a critical aspect. That's such a critical element. And many people live in an environment locked into TV shows, where they don't have any hope.

People in our study, generally, accessed very painful material. it was not a fun trip at all. It's actually puzzling in a way to me that it's known as a party drug.

Or I was just a stupid kid who was handed a machine gun and sent to a place where people blowing each other up. I did terrible things. But I was just a stupid kid back then.

    "text": "Peter Levine, welcome to the show. Thank you. I want to hear a lot about your personal story, but let's start with somatic experiencing. Can you just give me, and by extension, everybody listening, a brief description of what that is. Sure, sure. When I first started on my path in the mid to late 1960s, early 70s, I had the disadvantage, no, no, I had the advantage to not know that trauma, which would 14 years in the future would be listed as an incurable disorder or even a brain disease, that could at best be managed with medication and with helping people change their negative thoughts. I didn't know that was supposed to be the way. Things are. And I had a very, very different experience of what happens in the body. for example, you walk outside and you see somebody's been injured. Somebody has fallen off a bicycle and your guts twist. You've got a little yuck. And then you go out and you look closer and you see he's really been injured. you go to call 911, but your guts are still even more twisted. And what happens. What might happen is that night, I'm not saying this is traumatic, but just as an example, that night you may be laying in bed and all of a sudden you see images of the earlier that day with the person was injured. And again, your guts twist up. Now, if that becomes chronic, the body is then telling the brain that there's threat, there's danger, there's injury, and you better watch yourself. But it's something that comes from the body. I think of this sometimes as a part of us that is also very wise, that is very cognizant, that it's not just the mind, but it's really incorporating the body. And two years ago, I guess it was two years ago, I received the last Lifetime Achievement Award from the Psychotherapy Networker. And they had a picture in the magazine at the beginning, , those puzzles that have a gazillion parts, a thousand parts. And that one part was missing. And the caption was, the missing part. I think there's now more of a recognition among people in different fields of how important the body is and how our bodies respond to threat and how our bodies can perform.",

She said, when you and your father were, when I was pregnant, eight months pregnant with you, your father and I were canoeing on this lake in New Jersey and a wind squall came and tipped the canoe over and we couldn't the canoe. And we were certainly going to drown. And again, it would have been the end of my life as , of course, before it started. And, but then the small sailboat came along and there were two people in the sailboat and they rescued my parents. One was their older man. And the other one was a young woman. And they introduced themselves as, I don't know, a woman. And they introduced themselves as, I don't know, a woman. Albert Einstein and his stepdaughter. And my mother reasoned that because he saved my life in that moment of life threat, that somehow we would stay connected. I know this sounds totally weird. And sometimes, and only recently would I have the courage to even talk about this because I would be afraid of people thinking I was weird. But I'm not afraid of that anymore. And I've earned in getting this work out to literally a hundred thousand people, or 75,000 people worldwide. It's out. Other people are sharing that burden. It's off my shoulders. And the question, have I done enough. Which I try to address in the book. I can say, yes, absolutely. I've done enough because it's on the shoulders of these other people. These 60 people who are teaching semantic experiencing. But the question, am I enough. I think that is a work in progress. And that was really what I was trying to ascertain in writing the book for myself was, am I enough. And what does that mean. And what does it mean to me.",

It's time. Today we will talk about what I just discussed in the ZDF Magazine Royale, your uncancelled German satire late night show, what's going on in the USA. Show by Trump critic Jimmy Kimmel cancelled. How did it come about. What do you mean. What, what, what, what. After intense protests, Jimmy Kimmel returns with late night show. Huh. Whose late night show is not cancelled in the USA now, or cancelled. What. Trump critic Stephen Colbert loses TV show. Ladies and gentlemen and everyone in between and outside, there is a lot going on in America and that's why we have today in the ZDF Magazine Royale built an American late night studio on purpose. Just to discuss with you in real time what's going on over there on the other side of the Atlantic. What we have been sure to know since this week, the late night power relationship between Germany and the USA has turned. It's nothing before. We looked up to the Americans for 80 years, but since this week US American late night moderators are looking up to us, to German late night stars. Wow, there he is. Mr. Burt, I am. terribly sorry to disturb you. Why are you done. , I'm just a huge fan. My name is John and I host a late night comedy show on HBO. Comedy. I hate comedy. Germany. Germany, we're back. The German Bernd steals the English-American John's late night show. That's the new German self-confidence compared to the USA. Yes. Raab offers talkmaster Jimmy Kimmel his show. Absurd. But even more absurd is that Jimmy Kimmel is the only American late night show host. Jimmy Kimmel even got that. I heard from late night hosts in other countries, from Ireland and from Germany. The guy in Germany offered me a job. Can you imagine. This country has become authoritarian, the Germans are , come here. It's funny because it's sadly true. Hey, Jimmy Kimmel, just to clarify.",

In other words, for life and death or life threatening situations, the midbrain kicks on and it kicks on and overrides our prefrontal cortex. Again, we need that to happen in a life and death situation. The problem with narcissistic abuse is that it ignites those areas of our brain 24-7. That's why we use phrases walking on eggshells. What we're basically saying when we say we're walking on eggshells is that we are living in a hyper alert trauma state. Our brain is vigilant to danger 24-7. we are out of the thinking areas of our brain and we are constantly in the survival areas of our brain. And that's why we use phrases walking on eggshells. And that's why we use that. That is why we experience much change in our personality. here are some changes that I experienced. You can let me know down below in the comment section if these resonate with you, or if I missed any. When we are no longer in our prefrontal cortex, we lose what's called prefrontal attributes. Our prefrontal cortex, when it's activated, when we're living in that area of the brain, we have access to the executive command center, which helps us to pause in life. It helps us to reflect. We can't move in a different direction. We can't move in a different direction. We can't change the course of our life. We can't change the course of our life. We can't change the course of our We reframe, we forgive, we find solutions, we have compassion, there's joy. We're able to see the big picture. We're able to make clear decisions. However, when we don't have access to those things and we're stuck in our midbrain, we wind up reliving stress-based stories and responses over and over again. Our emotional center is highly activated. Our fear response is over activated. We don't feel safe in our body. We don't have clear thinking. We have a loss of memory. We get stuck in negative thought patterns. Our brain is struggling with rumination, with highly intrusive thoughts, with feeling something bad is going to happen. we aren't ourselves. Rather than being ourselves, we live in this constant state of fear.",

Those are completely two different narratives. One is, I want to be of service. That is how we were designed as human beings, not I want for me. And when you change how you look at the world, when you change what you want, you realize, one, a lot of what you think you want is worthless. Versus what. What is powerful, what gives a person purpose and meaning, which of course activates every aspect of your physiology, both brain and peripheral physiology, to work at their best, is being of service, being connected, caring for others. And we know through the work of Bob Buettner and the Blue Zones, or the work of Robert Waldinger and the 85-year-old Harvard study, when you care for others, when you look through that lens, everything in your life improves. And that is the place where you also have the ability to maximize the possibilities for your intention to manifest. You said that human beings are wired for service. As a neurosurgeon, as a person that, , you're here in Boston to go teach about compassion. You were the chairman of the Dalai Lama Foundation. Yes. how are we wired for service as humans. , if you look at our evolution as a species, unlike other species, one, we have a small litter size. That's a very clinical one. I think if I were your wife and you said that, I'd smack you, Dr. Doty, a small litter size. , my wife has smacked me multiple times, believe me. And our offspring do not run off into the jungle or the forest. They have to be cared for over a decade.",

    "text": "And then there's atmospheric emanation, fuck, and an irential trampoline affair. , I never took a confirming of this homepage or that It's based on neuroscience. And what I mean by that is the way in which you manifest, and I'll define manifestation, is the ability to take an intention and embed it into your subconscious in a manner such that it has the greatest likelihood to occur or to manifest. And what I mean by that is what people don't appreciate is every second we have about 6 to 10 million bits of information coming to us from our sensory organs. That's what makes us who we are. That creates our reality. But on a conscious level, we can only deal with 50 to 100 because 99. 9 go to maintain our bodily function. That 50 to 100, though, you have control over. 50 to 100 bits of information. Bits of information. how do you deal with that. , you take the tools, and what I mean by that is the tools to embed something into your subconscious. The best way to do that, and I'm sure you've heard the term, what fires together wires together. But can you explain that for the person listening. What does that mean. if you create habits, this results in the creation of neural pathways. And if the mere repetition of those habits actually lays down the The circuitry that then gets embedded and then actually makes things happen. And I'll explain it as follows. When you are able to use all of your sensory organs or abilities to embed that intention and do it repeatedly, that is when you're creating these neural pathways. As an example, if you have an intention, you take a pencil, you write it down, you're actually doing something physical, tactile. Then you read it silently. Then you read it aloud. Then you visualize that. And you do that over and over and over again. What that will do is then embed that into your subconscious. And then these different cognitive brain networks get activated. Now, can we unpack that just a minute. Sure. Because everyone that listens to this loves to make sure that they just got the instructions from You, Dr. Doty. Because I'm hanging on every word. And there were a couple steps to that. Because you had the physical pencil.",

Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. will you walk us through it one more time. Yes. again, what you want to do is to use all of your sensory organs as much as possible to embed that intention. by writing it down, by reading it aloud, by visualizing it, that creates the process where this gets embedded into your subconscious. And what happens is once you get this embedded, it activates different parts of your brain. And without getting too technical, one is something called the default mode network. Is that the same thing as the reticular activating system. No. But they're related. the default mode network. Yes. this is what happens when your mind wanders or you're daydreaming. And it's self-referential because it's internally focused. But it's where you create the narrative of who you are or what you want. if you have negative self-talk, if you ruminate, if you are , I'm never good enough, nothing works out for me, things that don't happen to a person me, I can never get it. That is in the default mode network. Oh, absolutely. And that gets really activated and results in rumination for some people. Can I ask you another question. Because one of the things that you said at the very, very beginning is you painted this gorgeous picture. Of the ability to leverage the remarkable power of your brain to help you get what you truly desire in life, to help you live in heart mode. And you said it's just about believing it. And part of the reason why we have trouble believing it is because of the default mode network and all of these stories you've repeated over and over and over. Is that fair to say. No, that's exactly correct. And we can reprogram or we can lay down a new track. Oh, absolutely.

What you're doing is you're creating a narrative of who you want to be or how you see yourself. What you're doing is you're creating salience. What's that word mean. It means making it important. Once something is important, this activates what we call our task positive network. And the task positive network has three parts. It has the salience network. It has the attention network. And then it has the executive control network. And once something is salient. What you're basically saying is this deserves my attention. And by doing it in a very specific way, then that becomes important to you. That gets embedded into your subconscious as something to pay attention to. Once that is defined as something important to you, then that activates your attention network. that then you cognitively focus your attention on whatever that intention is. Once those are activated, and I use the analogy in the book, it's as if you have a file cabinet and you put this file into the file cabinet that says important stuff. And once that is there, then the attention network is activated, which is, as an example, a bloodhound that says, , now there's something there. I need to track this down and figure out what's going on here. Then you activate the bloodhound, and then that gets released. And then once that attention is focused, then it starts looking around through all the possibilities in your environment. And as soon as it identifies one, then your executive control network is activated, which in some ways is the thing that chases down what is in your subconscious. And this is how it works. There is no magic here. This is fundamentally basic neuroscience. And it's something that we all have. You have the ability to master by just doing these techniques whereby you are able to embed your intention. You do it over and over. And it's not as if one and done.

Even in the din of all this noise, you are attuned to your name because it's deeply embedded in you. The same is true. And this is the nature of synchronicities and coincidences because your subconscious is always searching for what is salient. I want to expand on the power of learning how to be in the heart mode and what you just brought to the table, this dispositional optimism and the belief that things can get better, the hope and the optimism that things will turn out and feeling grateful, for that, because when you're in the heart mode, you've talked a lot about how we are naturally wired to be in that mode, calm, connected, open to service, open hearted. Can you explain how positive emotions, the emotions that you feel when you're in the heart mode, gratitude, compassion, love, how do those emotions communicate to your brain and accelerate or make it that you can feel the positive emotions. I think that's a really important question. I think I think you're doing in your life. How do you speak to your emotions. Is it stronger that what you're thinking about when you're in heart mode actually wires in a very strong way based on the emotions of heart mode. You just said it. Oh, I did. How do positive emotions gratitude and compassion and love create the ability to manifest or. ,. rewire your mind. As we said or discussed earlier, these types of positive cognitive belief systems make your physiology work its best, both your brain and your peripheral physiology. When all your cognitive brain networks function at their best, that is the greatest likelihood for you to manifest your intention.

And your limbic brain says you're not worth anything. You shouldn't respect yourself. You deserve to fail, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But now you've got a cortex that disagrees with your limbic brain. you have a battle going on in your brain between your limbic brain and your cortex brain.

And it can do a lot of stuff in their brain without them even noticing that they've gone to that negative place. I want to look at what are the things that trigger today slipping back into a negative critical mindset. And let me say again that for most people from complex trauma, if they're in a good headspace, positive, but they slip back into this negative critical headspace, that puts them in great danger. And I'm going to explain that in just a little bit. But what causes. What causes me to go back there without realizing it. The big picture answer is this. Anytime my limbic brain, my emotion center, has predominantly negative emotions, that will put me back into a negative critical mindset. just think of yourself. If you're full of anger, anxiety, you're depressed, you're feeling very guilty, your shame has been triggered, you're bored, you're discontent, you've got a lot of fear happening. If all of those are happening in your brain, or even just a portion of those are happening in your brain, my guess would be that you would become quite negative and critical. that limbic brain, when it gets triggered with negative emotions, its go-to is negative critical thoughts. be aware of that. let me take that into kind of the events that can trigger those negative emotions. if you've just failed, you're embarrassed, you feel terrible about it, I suspect that would take you to a negative critical mindset. Or if you're feeling stressed to the max, overwhelmed, not sure how you're going to keep coping, or if you're frustrated, not just with one thing not working , but with a series of things just aren't going the way you are, or if you are living with a whole bunch of unmet needs. You're lonely, you don't feel accepted, you don't feel part of, you're tired, I suspect you would get negative.

But only for a moment. And then it'll actually make things worse. the limbic brain solution is instant gratification, and becoming negative gives some instant gratification, but what it doesn't see is that in the long run, it makes you more discontent, more negative, it puts more pain into your limbic brain, and now it becomes a vicious negative cycle that gradually takes you to a darker and darker place. Let me expand another, another event, or another set of circumstances that can take you to a negative critical mindset. And this one, it doesn't mean that something bad is happening. And that's the important thing to understand with this one. anytime you feel a sense of insecurity, or uncertainty, or you don't have a rock, a person to lean on, you feel kind of all alone, for most people when they get to that state of instability, insecurity, uncertainty, they go to a negative critical mindset. that could be anytime you go through change. Anytime you go to a new job, to a new, you move, you go through just change of any kind, even good change, getting married, all kinds of good things. Any transition, transitions feel you're away from your rock. You're not sure what is solid ground yet underneath you. And you begin to have all these unknowns. What about this. What about this.

You will have a negative mindset towards a person if you have a resentment against them. just think of somebody that you might have a resentment against. It's kind of this burning anger, hatred.",

But if that's the only thing you do, it probably won't be enough. After a while, you'll stop doing it because you won't believe those truths anymore because you're not doing the rest. Now let me explain how this works out. I get clients to think of what are truths that you could tell yourself every day as positive affirmations. You can stick them on the fridge and every morning you can look at them and say to yourself, I have value. I am lovable. And do that. And you need to come up with some lie or some truths to begin to replace the lies. But you have to understand a very important thing about your brain. Shame and complex trauma are all about the limbic brain. And the limbic brain is the emotional part of your brain. The limbic brain is also the child brain. the child gets up in the morning and they say, I don't feel going to school I shouldn't have to go to school. how they feel determines what they think is real. what happens with shame-based people is I don't feel I'm good enough I'll treat myself as if I'm not good enough. I treat myself based on how I feel about myself. That is limbic brain thinking. That is complex trauma thinking. And complex trauma has made the limbic brain the most powerful part of your brain.

I'm going to do some meditation, some , go for a walk. And I start to feel guilty. I'm being selfish. And what does that shame part of your brain say. I'm going to get down on myself.

They need somebody else to do it. they're driven with this powerful drive to connect to their caregivers. they just try to connect over and over again. But what happens if their parents are neglecting and abusing them. They're not meeting their needs. They're hurting them. The child can't just run away from home and meet their own needs. They're too little. they are driven to still try to connect, but now they have to adapt. they learn to fawn. They learn to people please. They learn to adopt different roles and wear different masks. They learn to be attuned to the parents' needs, to put their own needs aside. They're trained to be codependent. That all becomes part, what happens inside of them because they need to connect. And a trauma bond takes place with somebody who's hurting them, but they have no other option if they're going to survive. But then what makes it even stronger, the bond, is for the child. They go, my parents aren't all bad. We have lots of good times. They are nice to me sometimes. We have fun together. And there's intermittent, erratic times that are good. And they go, see, these are wonderful people to connect to. That sets off this whole thing in the brain called denial, where they then are able to kind of deny the bad stuff and just focus on the good stuff. And all of a sudden, they paint their parent as a hero. They paint, they look at the lessons they've learned from all the bad stuff and they go, see, that means the lessons were good. All the bad stuff, was actually good because it taught me good lessons. And they just put their parent in this hero role because the child needs a hero. The child needs somebody to look up to. That's built into them as. And their brain is doing these distortions to try to make it feel good to the child. But something else is happening. What the child begins to realize is there's a bit of a cycle happening. It's a bit of a roller coaster. They go through good times and they're followed by tension.",

And I want you to see that. And I want you to see that. what are the dangers for people today when they come into recovery. If they've come out of complex trauma, they've come out of just existing and not thriving. They come out of surviving, but they've never really felt Zoe life. They had to kill that inside of themselves. First thing I think it's important to realize is that their existing survival mode, that was their default setting. That was their normal. And part of their brain is naturally just going to gravitate back to that. They know how to be a robot really. They know how to shut down things really. And just be aware that tendency happens. But secondly, realize that anytime your nervous system feels stress or danger, in other words, it gets triggered, it's going to want to go back to normal. And that's what I want you to do. And that's what I want you to do. Go back to survival mode, to all the ways of trying to keep safe, all the ways of shutting down what might get me hurt. And anytime that you're stressed, overwhelmed, tired, exhausted, depressed, anxious, in physical pain, experiencing conflict, angry, your brain wants to go back to survival mode. you say, I don't think I'm in survival mode now, but I'm not sure. I don't quite know myself enough. What are the danger signs that I might be sliding into survival mode. Let me just give you a few. And these to me are important to become aware of in your own life. First one to look out for is that something in you pulls away from people. You pull away from connection. Connection is what you really need now, but you actually, your brain is pulling away from connection. You think that isolation, is a better way to go because connection requires energy.",

The endorphins are two compounds, the most commonly known of which are endorphins, have a similar chemical structure to morphine, heroin, and oxycontin. A lack of strong social connection disrupts this balance amongst the brain circuits. you don't get social connection, all of a sudden, your brain's not getting what it was designed to get, and the opioid thing is all out of whack. it disrupts the balance amongst the brain circuits that use these feel-good chemicals produced by close relationships.

Responding to the pain of loneliness, our brain prompts us to seek rewards anywhere we can find it. in other words, if you don't get connection, your brain gets hungry for opioids. That's what she's saying. If you don't have healthy, intimate, deep connection with at least one other person, your brain is starving. And what she's saying is, if you don't have connection, your brain gets hungry for opioids. And if it is starving for opioids that it can't get from relationships which it was designed to get them from, it will look for them in other places. guess what happens when you find opioid drugs.

He broke his legs. here is a boy who can't walk and he hasn't been able to walk since he's been very, or since five years old. he's 25 now, 20 years of not walking. The next thing we're told about him is that when the nurse scooped him up, she took him to a place called Lodabar. And that is a town that was named No Pasture Land. what she is doing is saying, what is the location in Israel that nobody would ever want to go to. Where there would be no chance of having a job, a farm, an income, because there's, it's a desert, there's no pasture, it's a desert. And she's going to be a slave. And she's going to be a slave.

But what I want you to understand is that I think when it says Lodabar, No Pasture Land, it's also using it as a place to hide. It's also using it as a place to hide. It's also using it as a metaphor. It is saying that as Mephibosheth, the favored son of Jonathan, who is destined to be the king of Israel, had to run and flee for his life and became a cripple, he's been a No Pasture Land soul. He's been dead inside. There's been nothing of life that's growing there. His life has been dark and empty and barren. Now I want you to think of that in terms of yourself.

And if you're in a day where you're just doing a lot of intense thinking, processing, calculating, teaching, and you're using a lot of calories, and you're going to be tired afterwards.

Then you can change it once you get it to that conscious level. self-awareness is the first thing. Second thing, two weeks ago we talked about the lies we believe about ourselves, both about our value and about what gives us value. And now you begin to replace those lies with the truth. And we talked about that and what it means to respect somebody else and the different types of respect. We've talked about all of that. the point was this. In dealing with shame, there is a cognitive part. There's a replacing lies with truth part, but it's not the only part. There's an emotional part and lots of that we're going to get to. The other thing that we saw is in your brain, you have a limbic system that has become a bad. It speaks a lot of lies to you based on how you feel. And shame is a negative feeling. And your limbic brain says, you're not worth anything. You shouldn't respect yourself. You deserve to fail, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But now you've got a cortex that disagrees with your limbic brain. you have a brain that says, you're not worth anything. You're not worth anything. You're not worth anything. And you have a battle going on in your brain between your limbic brain and your cortex brain. And the goal of recovery is that your cortex brain trumps your limbic brain. when shame gets triggered, limbic gets fired up and it wants to trump your cortex. And what you're doing in healing is saying, shut up limbic brain. Here is the truth. I'm not listening to the distorted stuff you tell me. And it feels truth, but I know it's a lie. And now I'm going to respond and act on my cortex, not on my limbic brain. And then the other piece that we talked about is beginning to have positive affirmations about yourself that are the truth about your value, about who you are. that's part of that cognitive piece.

I began to realize being shy has a lot of positives that outgoing people don't have. And those are the things that you begin to think about. , next one. Not only are you accepting who you are, you also need to accept your past. what happens with shame is I hate my upbringing. I hate my family. I wish I didn't have it. I wish I had a whole different set of circumstances. And you can stay in that place of I wish, I wish, I wish, or if only for the rest of your life. Or you can come to a point where you say, I can't go back and change anything. instead of seeing it as all bad, I wonder what I could learn from it that would make me a better person.

That's how much important it is to life. 500 billion a year of business comes from the fish of the ocean, the other parts of the ocean, the chemicals, etc. it is an essential piece of our creation on all kinds of different levels. the amount of food it provides, understand one billion of the people of the world rely on the fish of the ocean as their major food source. That's how dependent they are. 10 of the protein intake in our world comes from the fish of the oceans. More fish are harvested than cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry, and eggs combined. That's the amount. That's the ocean. it is a massive food source. Next, how important is it. The ocean is the thing that moderates the temperature of our world. why don't we boil. Why don't we freeze. Thank the ocean for that. It plays a key role. It absorbs heat and cold. It absorbs the sun's rays and the heat from them. And if you didn't know, there are rivers at the bottom of the ocean that move the water around. when we go to Florida, there's the Gulf Stream that goes up the east coast of the United States and Canada. That is a deep underwater river that rushes north and carries the warm southern water up into the North Atlantic and it regulates the temperatures of the ocean. And then of the climates of the land. it becomes a big part of that. Do you realize that if we didn't have oceans, we wouldn't have mountains. I didn't really know that until a while ago. how did mountains happen. You got two continental plates that collide and get pushed up. Why don't they slide back down.

They haven't truly connected. Do , there was a study done just a couple of years ago about millennial children. They were talking about how they were the only children who have all the texting social media stuff, and what they're finding is this generation that seems more connected than any other generation is the loneliest generation to have yet existed because they don't have true connection. that is the reality of our culture. We have become a culture of fake connection, and that is a result of a shame base. And we don't have true connection, and it's completely false. let's see if we can get the feelings of connection, without true intimacy. Now I want to read you something that Dr. Rachel Wurzman wrote, which I think is excellent, because it's going to bring the drug picture into this whole connection thing. She's written an article, you can read it called, How Loneliness Fuels Opioid Addiction. She was on TED Talks as , about this, but here's what she says. The human brain uses naturally occurring opioids. opioids, we think of morphine, oxycontin, fentanyl, heroin. Those are all your opioids. T3s have opioids. They're painkillers,. But what she says is this. The brain uses naturally occurring opioids to maintain a balance among important brain circuits that shape social thinking and behavior. opioids have a bigger purpose than then deadening pain. They're also managing other circuits in the brain that have to do with social interaction,. Making certain experiences deep social connection feel good. In other words, when you connect with somebody at a heart level and are able to share in an environment where you feel totally safe, totally safe, and you're able to share in an environment where you feel totally safe, totally accepted, you feel good. Opioids are part of what makes that happen,. These compounds, the most commonly known of which are endorphins, have a similar chemical structure to morphine, heroin, and oxycontin. A lack of strong social connection disrupts this balance amongst the brain circuits. you don't get social connection.",

    "text": "All of a sudden, your brain's not, you're not getting what it was designed to get, and the opioid thing is all out of whack. it disrupts the balance amongst the brain circuits that use these feel-good chemicals produced by close relationships. Now she takes that in a different direction. When we are really hungry, we will eat anything,. We get that on a physical level. now what she's going to say is, similarly, loneliness creates a hunger in the brain. The brain, which neurochemically hypersensitizes our reward system, responding to the pain of loneliness, our brain prompts us to seek rewards anywhere we can find it. in other words, if you don't get connection, your brain gets hungry for opioids. That's what she's saying. If you don't have healthy, intimate, deep connection with at least one other person, your brain is starving. And if it is starving for opioids that it can't get from relationships, which it was designed to get them from, it will look for them in other places. guess what happens when you find opioid drugs. It says, if we seek it with heroin or opioid painkillers, it will be a heat-seeking missile for our social reward system. All of a sudden, our brain will say, who needs people. I just found what I'm looking for. I am no longer hungry. people are set up for opioid addiction, she is saying, because they didn't get connection in childhood. And many of you can relate to that. , then she takes it further. That's in part because of the striatum, which is our autopilot system. I talk about your default setting,. what it is saying is if you start putting opioids from chemicals, not from social interaction into your brain, it changes your brain's default setting, and the drug becomes the default state that keeps the pain at bay and the relief close. Overriding the system that would otherwise prompt it, or that would prompt us to seek human connections. why is it that many addicts, the more they use, the more they isolate. Because this system in the brain is changing, and it is not saying I need relationships and connection, it is saying all I want now is drugs. And the brain changes. now she goes to recovery. Recovery requires treatment across three categories. The first two, we do not need.",

    "text": "When the news came out that Saul and Jonathan were dead, the nurse of that little boy, Mephibosheth, said, the new king's going to want to kill him. I better hide him. she scooped him up and as she picked him up and fled and as she hurried away, she dropped him and he became a cripple. He broke his legs. here is a boy who can't walk. And he hasn't been able to walk since he's been five years old. he's 25 now, 20 years of not walking. The next thing we're told about him is that when the nurse scooped him up, she took him to a place called Lodabar. And that is a town that was named No Pasture Land. what she is doing is saying, what is the location in Israel that nobody knows. What is the location in Israel that nobody would ever want to go to. Where there would be no chance of having a job, a farm, an income, because it's a desert, there's no pasture. It is the last place anybody would look. it's the best place to hide because it's the most remote place in all of Israel. Lodabar. That's where you're going, Mephibosheth. he's been hiding in this far away, out in the desert, little village for 20 years. nothing has happened. But what I want you to understand is that I think when it says Lodabar, No Pasture Land, it's also using it as a metaphor. It is saying that as Mephibosheth, the favored son of Jonathan, who is destined to be the king of Israel, had to run and flee for his life and became a cripple, he's been a No Pasture Land soul. He's been dead inside. There's been nothing of life that's growing there. His life has been dark and empty and barren. Now I want you to think of that in terms of yourself. Many of you can relate to being Mephibosheth as a five year old. You had a good life. You had parents who were wealthy. You had a nice home. You had every privilege that a kid could get. You had it all going for you. You had a bright future ahead of you. Just Mephibosheth had. And he would have been chosen as the child in the nation of Israel who would have been the best at succeeding.",

But I don't think passionately desires me or delights in me. I want to start with a story that you've probably read and maybe have thought that you kind of got it. But I want to give you a bit of the cultural history and you're going to see this story come alive. It's about when chose his disciples. you remember at the beginning of his at 30 years of age, he picked 12 people to follow him, which became known as the 12 disciples and later the apostles. it says, One day as was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Peter and Andrew, throwing a net into the water for they fished for a living. called out to them, follow me, and I will show you how to fish for people. And they left their nets at once and followed him. A little further up the shore, he saw two other brothers, James and John, sitting in a boat with their father, repairing their nets, and he called them to come too. typically what we would visualize when we see that is how we would interpret saying, come follow me. And we would simply think, we're supposed to follow along behind him and see where he's going today. But that term was a very technical term. And when you understand it, you're going to see this begin to become alive. at that time in the Jewish culture, everybody went to school, and part of what they had to learn in school was they had to memorize the first five books of the. that's Genesis to Deuteronomy. And if you've ever read that, that would be a project to memorize. Now if you are a really, really keen student, you would memorize the entire Old Testament, all 39 books. That's just a massive accomplishment. As a child was getting to the point of graduation, some things would happen. First of all, the most respected rabbis, and rabbis were kind of the main religious teachers. They would come to the schools looking for the brightest, most capable students.",

Secondly, complex trauma you never felt understood. Parents didn't take the time often to see the world through your eyes. To understand you. To get you. To get your dreams, your passions, your fears. And you always tried to get people to understand you. Many people in complex trauma were made to feel they were stupid. People rolled their eyes when they talked. And they have this huge thing, I need to make people understand me. Because once they understand me, they believe, then they'll validate me. And what do you get with a gaslighter. Somebody who doesn't understand you. And you go, I just need to explain myself. I just need to explain myself. And they're going, fantastic, here's all kinds of ammunition for me to twist and use against them. But you keep trying to make them understand. Thirdly, complex trauma, tons of insecurities. About your body, about your personality, about your emotional makeup. And there's a lot of self-doubt that comes with, am I perfect. Am I pretty enough. Am I smart enough. Am I too boring. Am I too shy. I wish I was more outgoing. All of that makes a person vulnerable to a gaslighter. Because they're trying to prove to themselves that they're good enough. Because of their self-doubt. Fourthly, what happens in complex trauma is you get an authority figure, a parent or a school teacher, who says they love you, but then communicates to you that you're selfish or you're a burden. you say to mom or dad, can I sign up to play hockey. And they go, you're such a selfish kid. And what do you do as a child. You say they're. Because mom and dad, in your mind, are always when you're really little. then you take your brain and you go, I will twist my brain. To see that I am selfish. And you become a pro at twisting your brain to believe distortions are the truth. now when a gaslighter starts distorting reality, you're great at agreeing with them. Because you've done it all your life. And you are very prone to that. Next, conflict avoidance. You don't want conflict. Conflict scares you.",

I've already referred to it, but it's important to highlight again, people that are alone too much, who aren't experiencing secure attachment, aren't experiencing healthy relationship, they're going to be depleted. Flip side of that, people who fall in love. all of a sudden I'm in love, and now initially it seems to energize you, you've got all kinds of energy, you want to do all kinds of things, you're fueled by oxytocin and adrenaline and dopamine, and it feels great, but it's taking a lot of energy out of you, and it's going to take its toll. The next one is if you're in social settings where you're kind of the leader, where you're kind of the host, you have to be on your game, you have to be talking to everybody and making sure you've been in contact with everybody and everybody's , that takes a ton of energy. Or if you're in a social setting but you're an introvert, and you have to kind of force yourself to talk to people and talk small talk and talk about stuff that doesn't really interest you, that can take a ton of energy too, and it can be very depleting. Another one is if you lose somebody close to you. again, it's the end of a relationship, could be death, could be divorce, separation, but it's grief, and you're going through those very intense emotions. Another one is just constant conflict with a child and the family. The child just is rebelling, the child just is defiant, the child is disrespectful, the child is always making bad decisions, doing things, that can really take its toll on you and be very depleting. those are kind of the different areas that bring about depletion. important to become aware of those in your own life.",

It's interesting that they have found that people that are depleted aren't able to grip things and hold them for as long as they normally would if they're feeling energetic, if they have lots of resources and their gas tanks are full. maintaining grip on something is reduced. That's very interesting. That's a very interesting indicator. But some of the ones that you can be more practically in touch with would be people that are depleted often start to deviate in their diet. They're not eating as. They're not eating as good of food. They're binging, they're snacking more, or they're not eating as much as they should. those around food can be indicators. Often people that are depleted become impulsive in spending money. And it's their brain looking for pleasure, their brain looking for an escape. But they start to find themselves wanting to make impulsive spending decisions. People who are depleted usually are more irritable. And they begin to react aggressively in situations that really don't call for it. the slightest little provocation and they overreact to that. that's a very important indicator, that irritability overreaction. People who are depleted often, their cognitive abilities aren't as sharp. Their brain is slow, their brain is fuzzy. They have trouble with cognitive tasks, trouble with decision making. it starts to affect their ability to think properly. Often when people are depleted, they begin to lose motivation. they notice their motivation is lacking. It's not what it should be or normally is. People who are depleted find that when they're with people, they just don't want to put the energy into being present. It's when the person's talking, it's, oh, I wish they would shut up. Because I just don't want to sit and listen. there's a resistance now to wanting to be present. To other people. People are depleted, their parasympathetic nervous system starts to want to forcibly kick in. And sometimes it does that through, they start to get depression happening. Because they're running out of gas in their gas tank. depression starts to happen.",

Because you're comfortable with it, how to do it, but when you slide back into that role, you're not going to be able to do it. But when you slide back into that role, that relationship won't be healthy.

Now let me say this, that role as a child seemed to be a good role. It seemed to work. And that's why you kept doing it. And your brain in some place, is thinking today, it still might work today. But that role didn't work very. And in an adult relationship, it will always create problems and result in an unhealthy relationship. tonight we're only going to look at two roles. Many people have heard about these roles. What I have found is that most people haven't heard about them as a result of complex trauma.

And they are the child that is the super responsible, the most capable child. They overachieve. They're usually perfectionists, people pleasers. They're very organized. they're very good at their role of basically taking on lots of responsibilities within the family that people don't get as mad as much as they would otherwise. And they go into that. And they do it and they stick with it because they have the skill set to be very organized and to do things very. Now, here's what their thinking is. If I am the perfect child, then I won't cause mom and dad problems. they won't have more hassles to deal with because we got a lot of hassles in this family. And I will take the load off of them by doing extra responsibilities. that will enable them to cope better. That's what they're hoping.",

    "text": "The dogs who had not been shocked saw the way of escape and ran out of the cage. You want to know what happened to the dogs who had been conditioned by shocking. They could see the path to freedom. But they would not take it. The only way those dogs would get out of the cage is if the person went in and grabbed them by their collar and dragged them out as they resisted being dragged out. they saw the way of escape. They saw others escaping. But they were paralyzed by fear. And the only way was not just to explain the way of escape, not just to explain that it was safe. But to explain that it was safe. That still wasn't good enough. You had to go in there and for the first few times drag them out until they became convinced that they weren't going to get shocked this time. And that's the reality of people with complex trauma. It's important to show them the way of escape. It's important to point the path to freedom and give them the tools. But for some that still isn't enough. You have to push them to keep going even though fear kicks in and is triggered and everything in them wants to run back into the cage. You keep pushing them until they feel empowered to keep on doing it themselves. that becomes a starting point. Second thing I want to talk about. And Bessel van der Kolk does this very. But it was one of the first things that I heard when I entered into the field. Of addictions and complex trauma. And it was to understand how our culture operates by what is known as a medical model. And what I mean is this. Our culture operates this way. You have a pain in your side that's not going away. you go to a doctor. He meets with you for 15 minutes. Asks you questions. Does different things. Maybe takes some blood, etc. Afterwards he diagnoses your problem. Writes a prescription and gives it to you. And you take those pills and expect that within a very short period of time that pain will be gone. You will be fixed. a medical model says a doctor looks at you for a few minutes. Diagnoses your problem. Writes a prescription.",

    "text": "And you get a quick fix. Or he gives you a technique that will in a very short period of time get you better again. And you get better. And he will get you better again. our whole health model is built around quick diagnosis, quick solutions. And what Bessel van der Kolk found as he started his career as a psychiatrist is that he grew up and he was working where that was the mindset towards trauma. That you just diagnose the trauma. Say here take these pills or do this technique and you'll be all better. And he found that does not work. Trauma cannot be solved with the current medical model. There aren't quick fixes. Now when I was thinking of redoing this or doing this series, I thought what I'm going to go on the internet and I'm going to go to all the major trauma sites, web pages and look at all the latest research. And as I did that I got more and more discouraged. Because what I found is the whole approach to trauma, the vast majority of places is do this technique and it will fix you. And that has not been my experience. I wish it was. Now let me explain that. Because I don't want to make it sound I'm against techniques. I have had many people that I work with say I was thinking of going and doing that stuff where it was not working. Stuff where they use music and sounds to reprogram your brain. And others saying I'm doing some tapping exercises. And then others I'm doing EMDR, etc, etc, etc. And what I say to all of them is fantastic. Those you will find to be very helpful. But if you think that just doing that will take care of all your trauma, I think you're wrong. At some point you still have to go back to those deep places, to those deep unhealed wounds and begin to work on that. That combined with techniques becomes the path forward. But our society is hooked on quick fixes, magic solutions that people still run off after that and say why do I have to look at all of that. Painful stuff. It reminds me of when I was a kid. My parents brought in a foster daughter. And she was about 10 years older than I was.",

And I'm going to explain what that time is. big, big picture. Way back in Genesis 3, said after Adam and Eve rebelled against , they listened to Satan. said to Satan, someday I'm going to send my Messiah to crush you. And then in Genesis 12, Satan's listening because says to a guy named Abraham, that guy that's going to crush Satan is going to come from you. In other words, the guy that's going to crush Satan is going to be a Jew. guess what Satan wants to destroy is the Jewish people. And he's been working at that for years. The whole world of anti-Semitism. And what adds to the complication is not just that Satan wants to destroy the Jews, that Haman now as his messenger goes to Xerxes. And what you have to understand is Xerxes was the most powerful man in the world. Persia at that time ruled the world. And Xerxes made a law that if he signed a law, it could never be undone. if he signed a law, an agreement with Haman to wipe out the Jews, it could never be undone. now doesn't just have an issue with Satan. He's got to deal with the most powerful man. And guess what Haman gets him to do. Sign a law to wipe out the Jews. And if you're a spectator, you go, you got a big problem here. I don't know how you're going to pull this off. It is looking totally impossible. It is impossible to ever prevent the total destruction of the Jewish people. that's the big picture. Now let me show you all of the coincidences. , we're going to start with Xerxes. And we have to understand about Xerxes.

I will do something if I feel it. what happens in a limbic brain. You go, you just beat me up, I hate you, I'm out of here. Limbic brain just made a decision. Two weeks later, oh, I miss them much, I love them much, I'm back. If you let the limbic brain make decisions based on how you're feeling in the moment, it's going to be a yo-yo relationship. And you will never leave them. the point is this. The limbic brain doesn't look to the facts to make a decision. It looks to how I feel to make a decision. The cortex brain says, yes, I miss them. Yes, there's a part of me that still loves them. But the facts are they've got deeper issues that if they don't deal with them, they're never going to change. That's the facts. And I'm not the one to help them deal with it. I've tried. They've got to get outside help. That's the facts. I'm not going to let my emotions cloud my decisions. I know what the thing to do is regardless of how I feel on any given day. the cortex has to come into play if you're going to leave an abuser.",

I want you to think of your parents up at the top, you underneath that, and your parents are being neglectful, critical, abusive, all the things that we just described. what is happening is you got the yellow circle. You got the yellow square of the brain. as your parent, as you grow up with your parents, your parents are giving you these messages. And what are you doing. You're filing them away in your brain.

It's a very confusing thing for people. There can be degrees of brain fog. And you can experience them on the same day. you can go from kind of a mild brain fog where you're just a little bit sluggish in your thinking, have trouble finding words, to more severe brain fog where you lose the ability to speak. It's just all very much on a spectrum. let me give you some examples of just various ways that this can show up. I know a young man who, great business mind, great business potential. And coming out of university, got jobs, did extremely in the business world, very sharp mentally, great thinker, great analytical thinker. And he decided he wanted to go out on his own and be an entrepreneur, start his own business. He had all the skill set, the brain for it. And he got out on his own. And all of a sudden, he found he couldn't think. He had trouble making decisions. It's a very difficult thing. It was just a terrible, terrible thing for him. It's his brain shut down. And what he began to realize was he did super as long as the stress wasn't too great. As long as somebody else was the boss making the final decisions, carrying the weight and responsibility of the whole organization. As soon as he put himself in that role, the stress became too great and his brain didn't work as. that's one example. Another one is a person I know and they were going through a very stressful time in their life. And one evening, all of a sudden, their brain got very fuzzy. And then they lost the ability to speak. They just clammed up. They couldn't find words. They couldn't speak. And then the next day, they realized that they'd been watching a movie that they'd been watching. And they realized that they'd been watching a movie that they'd been watching for a long time. And they realized that they'd been watching a movie that they'd been watching for a long time. And that evening before. And they couldn't remember anything about that movie.",

Let's do this. Let's do this. I especially have a hard time focusing on tasks that require intense thought and focus. Rather, I find myself looking for quick and easy tasks to do or I catch myself switching to some mindless task. those are examples just to give you a sense of what we're talking about. Many of you can quickly identify that, yes, you've experienced this. A lot of people, when they go through this, they just think they're the only one that it's happening to and they get really down on themselves and think something's wrong with them. , know that you're not alone. This happens to a lot of people. And what we're going to look at now is that this comes out of primarily complex trauma. This is a common complex trauma thing. Now, before we get into that, I need to say that brain fog can be caused by other things. brain fog can be caused by hormonal changes. some women in pregnancy go through brain fog. It can also be caused by a change in diet. some people who change their diet up go through some brain fog because of changes in sugars and stuff in their body. If you abuse alcohol, that can cause brain fog. If you have a new medication, that medication might cause brain fog for you. there are different things that can cause brain fog.

Something that if the child was to look at accurately, if the child was to see clearly, it would be too much, too overwhelming. Because the child doesn't have the tools or support to deal with it. for the brain to let the child process and see this terrible thing accurately would do tremendous damage to the child. what the brain does to protect that child is to cause brain fog. It causes the child's brain to start shutting down that they're not able to process everything, to see everything. To see everything accurately to protect the child. It's not going to allow the child to go to this very painful, scary, stressful place because the child doesn't have the tools to handle that. What the brain does, and now we'll go to the kind of the science, the chemicals of that. What the brain does to help is when there's severe stress, severe danger, severe pain, the brain kicks in the sympathetic nervous system. And that means it kicks in a shot of cortisol. And cortisol fires up the adrenaline system that the person now has energy to fight or flight. But cortisol, what happens with cortisol in the brain is it shuts down the cortex. It says we don't have time to think about what to do. We got to get to our brain stem and our limbic system and just react. We have to make a decision to survive and we got to pick the one that looks it's going to lead to immediate safety. let's not weigh out all kinds of options. We got to go into action mode. that's the design of cortisol. Shut down the thinking, get into the limbic and brainstem we can act to survive. The problem with complex trauma is that cortisol is pumping all the time. And what we're going to see is that begins to negatively affect the brain. But also when a person gets to adult life, that system, the stress system can get activated very easily. They're often in it as a default setting. And cortisol is what causes the brain fog. That's the bottom line. It's about cortisol. But there's one other piece to this.",

The brain brings in another chemical, natural opioids, and that shuts down things even further. That takes a person to the dorsal vagal system or that it puts them into freeze mode. It puts them almost to a cataclysmic state. It puts them into catatonic, a dissociative mode. And that sets them up for even greater brain fog. They retreat into an inner world and their ability to be present and engage the present world kind of disappears. And two chemicals are working to create brain fog, cortisol and opioids. What's really important for people in recovery to understand is this. we've been looking at cortisol being produced or opioids being produced because your external circumstances are too painful or stressful. And the brain says, don't have the tools to deal with it. Don't have the supports to deal with it. we have to blur reality that we protect the person. That's key. Secondly, what can happen is if a person starts to heal and they're going into deeper inner worlds and accessing deeper wounds, the brain might actually say, not ready to go there. To go to that wound would be opening a can of worms that is way too painful. as they are in the recovery journey starting to heal and they start getting close to a core painful issue, they might actually experience brain fog. Because their brain is saying, don't want to go there. Don't think I'm ready to go there. let's start blurring everything again. the bottom line is brain fog is not just about protecting a person from present day stress and pain. It's also about protecting them from hidden pain. be aware of that in your recovery journey. Now I want to read to you. A bunch of kind of scientific researchers and what they say about cortisol and the brain. Just to really drive home what I've said in very general terms. Stericina researcher says this. Things can go particularly awry when it comes to moments of heightened emotional stress or trauma. There's a -documented effect called the weapon focus effect. If you're held at gunpoint, all your attention is focused on the weapon. The most threatening item on the scene.",

Dr. Chloe wrote Roland a clinical psychologist says this. It's an interesting really interesting function of the brain part of your brain. Namely the hippocampus the main memory hub and the amygdala the -called emotion center basically go offline because of the chemicals cortisol that are released at the point of intense stress. you don't fully lay down the memory of what's happening then. Because the memories are essentially offline when things begin to come back. They appear to be fragmented. one result of cortisol is it prevents memories from getting laid down smoothly. And then when you try to recall it's just pieces and fragments. Dr. Jolene Brighton a study following a famous cohort called the Framington Heart Study found that higher cortisol levels especially in women. Were linked to poor. Performance in memory organization visual perception and attention. The study comprised over 2000 participants primarily in their 40s. Those with higher cortisol levels also were associated with physical alterations to the brain which became linked to dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Krishnan. what's causing the blockage. Of information in your brain. there's no death definitive answer. One idea is that your body's immune system response could cause inflammation in your brain. What causes your body's inflammation response stress and cortisol. when inflammation occurs this could cause a temporary blockage in processing information. Brain fog can be caused by chronic stress. Hormonal changes and blood sugar imbalances. Brain fog is a sort of manifestation of some type of inflammation or chronic stress response. Chronic stress can have secondary effects. It's impacts your sleep your nutrition and your physical ability. Those secondary issues can lead to or be associated with psychiatric disorders. what we're seeing. Is all of this cortisol in the brain. It causes brain fog but it can begin to cause dementia Alzheimer's other psychiatric disorders. It is taking its toll on the brain. But then it affects physical stuff sleep autoimmune stuff it and we've done a talk on it. It is just got a profound negative effect suppress cortisol.",

I found it interesting just to kind of back away from this and look at Kate. We're looking at cortisol and we're looking at cortisol and brain fog. But just you're aware. What else does high cortisol levels do. It's connected to anxiety depression and irritability. It's connected to muscle weakness fatigue and sleep problems. When there's a lot of cortisol happening people can either get weight gain or unexplained weight loss. It can go either way for them some when there's ongoing cortisol happening. It changes their skin. there's a thinning of the skin. They easily bruise. There's stretch marks that easily happen. It definitely affects your whole digestive system. you have digestive issues irritable bowel diarrhea constipation. Crohn's disease nausea all of that excessive cortisol. Then high blood pressure headaches memory problems and then brain fog. this cortisol issue is just massive. Aaron Tribby says this if you ever felt stress affects the way you think. Here's some of the few consequences of high cortisol levels on the brain. the amygdala hippocampus. The prefrontal cortex are the most affected areas of the brain by cortisol together. They control your emotions. You're learning your memory your executive function and decision-making. cortisol is going to affect all of those negatively and that's what we've been looking at. Then you have mild cognitive impairment which is sometimes a precursor to dementia or Alzheimer's disease. And again connected to elevated cortisol levels. you're learning your brain's response to stress. over exposure to cortisol can kill off brain cells and smaller brain volume. HPA activity which is your response to stress has been linked which releases cortisol has been linked to more rapid decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

I should have known this. No, don't go there. Or others get angry. I'm mad that I wasn't taught this. And they just want to lash out. That anger's natural. Just don't feed into it. Don't go there too much, but acknowledge it. Some get very impatient. , I want to learn it all now. Just understand it's better late than never. Better to start now than not at all. This is where I'm at. I need to start learning healthy sexuality. And with that, learn the difference in your life between attachment-based sex and just purely physical animal sex. When you can begin to learn how to learn sex, how to have emotional intimacy first as part of sex, as the foreplay. And foreplay's not just a half hour before the sex. It's the whole week, 24-7, of learning to connect emotionally, providing safety. And that means there's going to be growing trust, growing acceptance, growing openness, growing vulnerability, growing connection, and talking about deep relationships. And you can start to learn more about what you're going to be doing. And that's when you start to learn how to do deeper and deeper things. When you are really working on developing that, what you're going to begin to realize, it just enhances your sex life. Your sex becomes even more pleasurable. It's the cherry on top of the sundae. with that, to me this is important. Learn to communicate regularly and openly with your partner about sex. What I have found for many, many couples is they can talk about everything except sex. It's the topic that just gets avoided. They expect the person to just kind of read their mind, to figure it out. Talk about it. There's no shame in that. Talk about your needs. Talk about your. Talk about your dislikes. Talk about frequency. Talk about things you would to explore. Talk about your love language and things that help you emotionally to warm up. And to feel connected. Have all of those conversations.",

And our brain is committed to balance, which means the meeting of our needs within certain parameters and if those aren't met, stress system activated and we can dysregulate. The second thing is if we're not connected. we all need a connection to a safe person. A rock, a stable person, a strong person. And if we're not connected, and for better or worse, посмотрим And if we're not connected, our stress system is activated. And again, what happens when a baby doesn't feel connected. They cry because their stress system is activated. Next, whenever we have external danger around us where we could get hurt, it activates our stress system. Next, we all have stress. Stress is a necessary part of life. Every responsibility task creates some stress. And our brain is able to manage stress without being overstressed. But if all of a sudden we get a whole bunch of new responsibilities or problems or things that go wrong, our stress system gets activated because we're starting to feel overwhelmed. And then the next one is whenever we go through change, we go into a new situation where we've not been before, new surroundings, new job, new relationships, our stress system is activated. Then if a past trauma gets triggered, an old abandonment wound gets triggered, an old hurt gets triggered, we get rejected, we get shamed. That causes our stress system get activated because the fear is it's going to happen again. And we can get dysregulated. And then the last one is if we're hanging around somebody who's emotionally dysregulated. they're panicking, they're angry. And what we learn is that emotions are contagious. We pick up other people's emotions. if they're panicking, they're angry, they're angry. if they're panicking, they're angry, they're angry. And what we learn is that emotions are dysregulated. The tendency is for us to become dysregulated. Oh, dad's upset. , I can't relax now until dad calms down. And those are things that cause dysregulation or potentially cause dysregulation. let's go to what regulates our emotions. , a baby cries because it's out of balance. And it's dysregulated. it cries. It's hungry, whatever. The parent comes, responds to their cry and meets their need. It senses they need food, they're cold, they need to get warm.",

And that's why people can go into a fight-flight response and it hasn't yet reached their cortex. , big picture. Healing complex trauma is about healing our limbic brain. that we learn to be able to regulate our limbic brain when it gets triggered by connecting to a past trauma. That is a super challenging thing to do. And again, I'll come back to that in just a minute. , because of how our brain processes bottom up, it sets us up to dysregulate. Because it starts at the brain, stem and the limbic brain and compares to anything similar to that from your past.",

    "text": "The second thing I want you to see that complex trauma does to mess up the regulating system is the rhythm part. what happens to a child, comes out of the womb, has had the rhythm of mom's heartbeat, now is hungry, now skins its knee, dysregulates, cries, cries, and then it's a mess. Nobody comes to rock them. Nobody comes to provide soothing. They have to learn to rock themselves. They have to learn to self-soothe. And that's where you can see people from complex trauma who go through a dysregulation time in their adult life and all of a sudden they're rocking, or they're tapping, or they're jarring, jiggling their leg. Their body is looking for a rhythm that will help regulate. Now if they find a rhythm by rocking or jiggling their leg that helps regulate, there's still a problem. Remember there's three parts that are absolutely necessary. There also has to be connection and meeting their need. if they rock, but their knee, their beat is not met and they don't connect. They feel a bit regulated but not totally regulated. Because the two other ingredients aren't there. Now let me take that a bit further to OCD, obsessive compulsive disorder. This is about a rhythm thing. This is about trying to regulate my limbic brain through activity. activities. think of a person who leaves the house and then they can't remember if they lock the door. they go back and they lock the door and they find out, that helped me relax because I checked. Or let's say a person's outside and then they come back in and they are feeling a bit nervous about where they've been and what they've touched. they wash their hands and they find out that regulates the dysregulated emotions, the fear in their limbic brain. now they've learned that if you're leaving the house, make sure you check that will regulate your brain. If you're out and about and come back home, wash your hands. That'll help regulate the fear in your limbic brain. then what happens is not only when they wash their hands, they're not going to be able to feel the fear in their limbic brain. Did it regulate their limbic brain. It also activated their reward system.",

    "text": "When they checked the house to make sure it was locked, that also regulated their emotions and activated their reward system. then what begins to happen is a belief starts to happen that if my limbic brain is feeling dysregulated, there's fear, the solution is wash my hands. The solution is check the house. Maybe I need to check it two or three times. Maybe I need to shut the light off two or three times. now they start an activity that is being used to regulate their limbic brain and it seems to work. they start a belief that checking many times, washing many times helps me calm down, helps regulate my brain. a belief system is now developing and it seems to be because it works. The activity, the rhythm regulates my emotions. Now what happens if two different scenarios, you've got that belief system now, you leave the house and you've got other things on your mind and you forget all about your routine of checking until you're a mile down the road and all of a sudden you go, I forgot to check. What happens now is it activates your stress system. It activates your limbic brain to an even greater degree. Now you're in fear. You can't get on with your day because you didn't check. And the only way you can get your brain to slow down to regulate those emotions is drive all the way back home and check three times. The same is true with washing your hands. You got other things on your mind and you forget to wash when you get home and then you remember you didn't wash and it just goes through the roof. , there's a second thing that can happen. Let's say you come home and you start washing your hands. Because you're dysregulated, but you wash it three times and you're still dysregulated. It didn't calm you down this time. , what does your brain go. , let's just keep washing. Let's wash four times, five times. We'll wash till our brain settles down. what has happened.

And that limbic brain doesn't regulate the brain. , let's just keep washing our hands. The limbic brain is making them a prisoner. And it is hard for a person with OCD who is all about the limbic brain and trying to regulate it and thinking they found the solution only to find that it's not a good solution. It's hard for them to get to their cortex and look at reality accurately because their limbic brain is in control and is distorting everything. what we have to do is to make those people think that if I don't do this, something bad is going to happen. And it becomes a prison to them. The third thing that was important for regulating emotions was connection. But what we already hinted at is that in complex trauma, that connection doesn't happen. Either the parent doesn't respond to the dysregulated child. They neglect the child. They neglect them. Ignore them. Or the parent comes and connects, but they're dysregulated. They're annoyed at the child. They're impatient with the child. They're angry. And the child picks up that. But what can happen is it's a two-sided thing. They love that the parent connected. that helped regulate them a little bit. But it left them dysregulated. And that's where in adult life, a person in an abusive relationship, they can get abused by their partner and get all dysregulated. And then their partner comes and they connect. And it feels good to connect, but it doesn't solve anything. But that comes out of complex trauma. Now more than that, what happens when the parent doesn't respond or the parent responds in their own dysregulated way. They're not able to connect. They're not able to connect. They're not able to connect. And the dysregulated way is it inflicts new wounds on the child. Because now the child feels rejected. They feel shame. I'm a burden. I'm annoying. They feel all alone. They might even feel abandoned because nobody came. And it leads to new dysregulating wounds inside of them. Now let me go to the medication part. we have. We have oxytocin and cortisol.

And then the next time you face that danger and the limbic system begins to get the alarm system, the front part kicks in and says, no, I got this covered. I got this covered. You can relax. I know what to do. In the case of extreme danger, the brain, that limbic system says, this is really scary. This is really dangerous. What it then does is shuts down the front part of the brain. Says, I'm not listening to you because I don't got time to think this through. This is dangerous. I got to act now. And the limbic system takes over and shuts down that front part of the brain and you go fight, flight and you go into action. Now take that to growing up in complex trauma. instead of your parents responding when that limbic system is aroused and the alarm bells go off, nobody helps you cope. And what does your brain begin to do. Your brain begins to see all dangerous situations as extremely dangerous situations. And instead of even thinking about the situation and possible solutions, that part gets ignored and shut down and the limbic part takes over and it goes into fight or flight. And what is the sad reality for kids today. What is the sad reality for kids today. What is the sad reality for kids today. The sad reality for kids that grow up in complex trauma is they have this overactive limbic system that doesn't have a front part of the brain that can help them process the danger around them. And as soon as they smell danger, fight, flight kicks in a nanosecond and no thinking happens at all. And that's kind of what's going on in the brain. Now let me take that further to now you're in a recovery situation. You're aware that you have trauma. What do you do with that now. let me back up to this diagram. The bottom line is that original brain circuit. as you face danger, which is the trigger that says alarm bells go off, we are in danger. You fight flight and you build a brain circuit.

    "text": "And it gave to me this new appreciation. Of the design of our planet. And how all the climate systems work together. that is the monsoon area in orange of the world. And what you need to understand about that. Is that's about half of the world's population. And what a monsoon is, is that those parts of the world don't have rain for seven or eight months of the year. And then they have rain. And then they have basically nonstop rain for four or five months of the year. There's records in India that sometimes during that four to five month rainy season. That they'll get a meter of rain in one day. that's the deluge that comes on. What I found out in this series was that. half of the world is affected by monsoons. We don't get it in North and South Africa. We don't get it in North and South America. But that feeds their entire economy. all of their economy is dependent on those monsoons coming. And as you begin to understand how they come about. It is absolutely fascinating. I'm going to get you to do that with me. there's two starting points for a monsoon. One is in the south. One is in the north. Both involve great amounts of heat. Close to the ocean. in Australia. I don't know if you've ever watched Australia in our winter. But it gets up to 40 degrees. And then in their very dry spots. You'll get these tornadoes of fire. And you watch them as they cycle. In the middle of those. And they go about 100 meters high. It gets to about 1000 degrees centigrade Celsius. In the middle of those tornado fires. it's super heated hot air. That goes way up in the sky. what happens when you get a whole lot of heat. That's creating into the sky. It draws in air. It needs to be fed. And where does that air come from. Australia is an island in the middle of the ocean. it starts to draw in air from the ocean. But it's hot. That it's drawing in fast air. it's creating super. it's creating storms on the ocean. And the ocean begins to get stirred up. But all of this moist air is coming in and gets sucked up. And it goes up those tornadoes.",

It slows down when it hits the ocean and creates a delta. And that delta has all kinds of nutrients that go into the water that feed the fish. you got all of that information. And that's only one little wee part of what happens with a monsoon. Do you see that. You could say, isn't that an interesting coincidence. It gets hot in Australia. And it gets hot in Tibet. And then you get a big rainstorm. And then you go, but it happens every year. It happens at a predictable time. The whole economy keeping people alive is dependent on it. Half of the world's population is dependent on it. And it comes clockwork. Now isn't that a coincidence. And you go, wow. I wonder who designed that. that it somehow would work that. And that's what happened. let me give you just one little detail beyond that. as I'm watching this you go,. Those years, those months of drought. it's four or five months of rain. But there's seven or eight months of drought. What happens as the drought gets worse and worse. Plants start to dry. Everything, the food, there's no more food for the animals, etc. And then I found out there's this one tree called the Mahua tree. And guess when it bears its fruit. At the driest time of the year before the monsoon. just when the animals are running out of things to eat, this weird tree out of total dryness pops out fruit. And the animals get their last meal before the monsoon comes. what I've done ever since I was a boy is I said I love to learn about nature. Because in learning about nature I learn about. And as I learn about nature I learn about 's greatness. But his genius mind to design such an intricate web of systems that need each other. But they feed each other and they keep this whole planet going. And they keep us alive. And what is saying is, I hope when you look at the monsoon and you look at that dumb Mahua tree, you go, wow.

As a key need in all of us. what does that include. A bunch of sub needs. It means that we learn healthy self care. We learn to take down time. And that could be a vacation. That could be a day off. That could be just taking evenings to relax. That means learning that we have needs for play. For fun. Just to get away from stresses. And just have fun doing stuff. That means we need healthy escapes in life. Hobbies. Walking in nature. Going out and doing travel. Exercise. Music. Art. All of those different healthy escapes. We need all of those things to keep balance between work and rest. we don't burn out. our identity is not all about what we do. All of those sub needs are important. And then we're wired to need beauty. Beauty creates the positive limbic brain experiences that we need to be healthy. we're drawn to beauty. And for many people what that means is they need to have some interaction with nature. With animals. Something about doing that meets something deep in them that feeds their soul. For others, that beauty is experienced through art. Through music. Through travel. And as they do that, it just gives those positive limbic brain experiences. Others, that beauty, that need is met. That need is met because they have a need to explore. A child explores. A child is always wanting to discover new things. That's part of what that sub need of exploring is all about. beauty. But has sub needs. And then connected to that is this need for a sense of awe or a sense of wonder. Now some would put that in a religious category. They can for them. But here's what I want you to understand. There's something in us that needs to connect to something bigger than ourselves. again, some would put this in a spiritual category. But not necessarily. Just think of those circumstances that give you goosebumps. That's kind of the experiences. The sense of wonders. The goose bump experiences. And again, it's a limbic brain experience. It's a positive limbic brain experience.",

And begin to think through how you're going to begin to learn to meet those needs in your life. Just don't expect to do it all in one day. Don't expect that you're going to be a pro at this overnight. Give yourself permission to gradually learn. How to meet all of these needs. Now let me just talk about doing that. How do we grow in meeting all of these sixty-eight different needs. understand first of all. That needs in children. Who meets them changes. the meeting of that need is dependent on their age. when a child is really young, the parent feeds them. But they don't plan to still be young. They're not really feeding the child when they're ten. The child should be able to feed themselves. part of feeding the child, meeting that need. Is also teaching the child tools. that the child can gradually learn to meet the need for themselves. And that is important to understand. it's not just that we learn what the sixty-eight needs are. It's that we're learning the tools to meet those needs. And that's dependent on your age. Now that's important in complex trauma. Understand it's not dependent on your physical age. But on your toolkit age. You see you might be fifty. But you have the toolkit of a ten year old. if I'm teaching you to meet your needs. I'm not teaching you as if you're fifty. I'm teaching you as ten. I'm teaching you. I'm helping meet that need. But I'm also teaching you quickly the tools. that you can learn to meet the needs. that you can catch up. And your toolkit can be fifty. Just your biological age is. what I tell many clients that I work with is. You're fifty but you have a toolkit of a ten year old. We're going to take forty years. And we are going to condense learning into a couple years. that within a couple years. Hopefully you're going to have the toolkit of a fifty year old. Just your biological age.

And that's where you have to think of it in terms not of your biological age. But your actual toolkit age. And accept that you're there. And learn appropriate to that age. Secondly. Understand that some needs. Are not something that you can do. Some needs. If they're going to get met. Involve other people. I can't have true connection all by myself. I can connect with myself. But I need more than that. I need people in my life. And this is important just to emphasize. That we're not talking about all of these needs. that you can be totally self sufficient and isolate. No we need others. Now you might not need hundreds of people. But you will need a couple people. You can't do recovery alone. You can't be healthy all alone. You can't have joy all alone. We are made for connection. Then understand. That some needs are first met by others. But then I learn to meet them myself. And. Though others met them feeding me. Over time I don't need anybody to feed me. I can feed myself. And that is going to happen in your life today. let me put it this way. A child needs to be accepted totally by their parents. But what happens as they experience that total acceptance. Is they come to accept themselves. now as an adult. They can be amongst people who don't them or don't accept them. And they're with that. Because they accept themselves. They can meet that need themselves. Now it's still nice. If they have people in their life. Who still fully accept them. But they don't necessarily need that all the time. But what happens if you didn't get full acceptance when you were growing up. And you don't accept yourself. Now you have to learn to accept yourself. But you're probably for a little while. Going to need people in your life. Who fully accept you. And they meet that need in you. And teach you how to meet it yourself. even though you might be 50. Understand that I might need today. People in my life who accept me. People who encourage me. People who meet all my love needs. Because I don't know how to do that yet.",

Occasionally, sixty to seventy-nine is probably an issue for you. Eighty to ninety-nine is probably a significant life trap for you. And a hundred to a hundred and twenty is probably one of your core life traps or core issues. Now, I want to just lay out how I want to approach this topic. Because many, when they approach this topic, I think approach it in ways that really don't work for people with complex stress. , many approach procrastination and just see it as a character flaw that they need to overcome. , what tools do I need to just get over this character flaw. And they're judging themselves. They're seeing it very negatively as a bad thing. And , they go to many therapists and self-help books. And the approach that is used often doesn't work with people from complex trauma. That's what I want you to understand. It gives a lot of helpful advice, but it doesn't produce lasting change for people from complex trauma. Because it doesn't get to the crux of the matter. , the focus is becoming motivated, getting organized, accountability, having a to-do list, increasing your self-discipline, rallying support for you, how to make good decisions, think positively. , it's really focused on that area of changing behaviors. And that usually doesn't work. And , it's really important, I think, to deal with this correctly, is to understand that the brain actually developed the strategy of procrastination to protect a little child. It was their only tool available to protect this child from getting hurt. And , if you look at it as initially being not a flaw, but a thing that the brain was doing to try to protect the child. , instead of getting down on yourself for procrastinating and trying to resolve it by ramping up discipline and ramping up motivation, it's best to begin by understanding why the brain had to use procrastination to protect the child. And , we're going to approach it with compassion and curiosity, not with judgment, and we've got to fix this flaw.",

    "text": "Next thing I think is important to understand is that if procrastination started as a way to protect the child, it became part of the subconscious brain. And now, when it gets triggered, you're not even aware that it's being triggered often. It's happening in the subconscious brain, but it's also valid. But it's also very intense, because this was protecting a child from getting hurt. And , that creates intensity now when it's triggered. , you can slide into procrastination, and there's an intensity, but you don't even know what's going on or truly why it's happening. , to get in touch with this part of the subconscious brain, it's often helpful for people to try to go back in their mind to the things the child experienced, that caused them to start to procrastinate. What were the child's fears. What was the child's motivations. What was going on in the child's life. If we can approach it that way, often we can begin to bring true, lasting change. , another way to say all of this is, for people from complex trauma, the place to start in healing procrastination is not top-down, motivational, discipline, organizational stuff, though that's going to be important down the road. The place to start is healing the inner child, healing the wounded child. That is key. , that's going to be our approach. Now, there's different ways to try to get kind of the picture of procrastination in your mind. , we're going to look at it just from a couple different angles. , there's kind of three different types of procrastination. , the first would be the person that says, the least liked job I'm going to do last. The problem with that is, they always find more enjoyable jobs to do, and they never get around to doing that least liked job. They keep pushing it aside, but what is important to see is that they look they're accomplishing lots of stuff in their life, but it's all more enjoyable tasks. They're procrastinating that important job, that they don't want to do. And , they're still procrastinating. , pushing stuff to the last is one approach. Secondly, it's the person that knows they need to do an important job, but they immediately go to avoid by distraction. , let's do something else. Let's clean the house. Let's play a video game.",

    "text": "And part of the procrastination in dealing with it is beginning to understand the lies we tell ourself, the ways we justified it to try to relieve the guilt, to try to relieve the shame that we were feeling. Another thing that's important to understand is that when a person switches into procrastination mode, they get a task, they know they need to do it, they think about it for a little bit, and then they start to avoid a void, they usually switch into victim mode. They usually switch into poor me, my life sucks, and they just feel they're a victim of their circumstances. And there's a certain helplessness and hopelessness that goes with that. The next thing we need to understand about procrastination with the child is they initially did it to survive, but then it became a habit. And now even if they don't need to do it, the habit has been formed in the brain. And the longer one stays in the brain, the longer one stays in a habit, it creates an inertia. It's kind of setting cement. It just gets harder and harder to lift your foot out of. It keeps you stuck because you've been in it for long. And when a person wants to deal with procrastination, they really have to deal with three things. They have to overcome the inertia of just being in that place for long. They have to break the habit, and then they have to heal the underlying issues. important to see there's many facets to healing. let's look at how do I change this. Most have come to the point where they realize they hate it. It's causing all kinds of problems. They want to change it, but for some reason they keep falling back into it. It's a prison to them. what I want you to realize, we really have to deal with it on two levels. You got to deal with practical stuff in the here and now, but you got to deal with that wounded child. Why did that brain develop procrastination as a way to protect that child. But before we get to that, let me start with two important things that you need to make a distinction between. Most only see procrastination in negative light. As something that is unhealthy.",

We expect everybody to treat us perfectly. We expect everybody we meet to be perfect. We expect recovery to be a breeze. You realize what you just set yourself up for. To be mad all the time. To feel sorry for yourself all the time. To think life gave you a dirty deal all the time when it's your expectations that are out of whack. And you have to go and look at that. And then our brain has a part that remembers the greatest moments of our life. The greatest pleasure times. as soon as life starts getting a little rough in the here and now, that part of our brain goes back to the euphoric aspects of using a long time ago. And it gets us starting to think about that and about how tough recovery is. And it ignores the bottom that we were at. It ignores all the damage and hurt we've done. It just starts to make relapse sound the best idea in the whole world. And recovery the worst idea in the whole world. your brain, what I want you to see is, it has constant wars. One part of your brain with another part. They are fighting all the time. One wants to do the thing, the other wants to do the wrong thing.

And then the last part of your brain is that good old limbic emotional part of your brain, the child brain that gets triggered by fear and anger and embarrassment and depression and all of those things.

Which another way to say that is learning to sit in uncomfortable environments. In uncomfortable emotions to a degree. what happens sadly with complex trauma is at first I do fight, fight or freeze whenever I'm in severe danger. But then it morphs. And now I start doing fight, fight, freeze whenever I'm in any uncomfortable emotion. I won't tolerate any uncomfortable emotion, any distress. I have to learn to tolerate some distress.

Are because of what your spouse just did. They rolled their eyes. Probably what's happening now is only a small percentage of why you're reacting the way you're reacting.

They're going to go ouch. They're going to jump. They're going to get upset. And if you can look at triggers today. And go, I'm triggered. I'm not going to beat myself up that I got triggered.

If they have lots of resources and their gas tanks are full. maintaining grip on something is reduced. That's a very interesting indicator.

They're binging. They're snacking more. Or they're not eating as. Much as they should. those around food can be indicators. Often people that are depleted become impulsive in spending money.

    "text": "Now, I want you to think about this and maybe reflect on it in a serious way. Have you ever witnessed a family where one person seemed to carry all the blame for everything that went wrong. Someone who, when they weren't around, the family seemed lost, confused, unable to function. You might have seen it in your own family or a friend's. You might have seen that when this person was absent, a strange and frantic energy took over as the family members scrambled, consciously or not, to find a new target for their negativity. That is the vacuum effect of a scapegoat's departure. This isn't just folk psychology. It's grounded in -established, established theory. Murray Bowen's work on family systems theory, his concepts of differentiation of self and family projection, maps this out perfectly. The less differentiated the members of a family are, the more emotionally enmeshed they are, the more likely they are to triangulate and project their anxiety onto a third party. The scapegoat is the ultimate destination for that projection. From a Jungian perspective, you could say the scapegoat is the designated shadow carrier. They are forced to embody all the dark, repressed, and denied aspects of the family's collective psyche. The narcissist, by definition a creature who cannot face their own shadow, outsources it. They hand their darkness to their child and say, here, you carry this for me, but here's where it gets really interesting and disturbing. When that scapegoat finally says, enough, and walks away, something extraordinary happens. They take the shadow with them. And the family, for the first time in perhaps decades, is left alone in a , lit room with its own undealt with darkness. And they have absolutely no idea what to do. You bloody know what I'm talking about when I say this, the first thing that happens when the scapegoat leaves isn't relief. It's absolute panic. It's not a quiet sigh from the family system as a source of tension is removed. No. It's the shriek of a machine that has just had its most critical gear torn out while running at full speed. It's the frantic primal terror of an organism that has lost its primary adaptive mechanism, however pathological that mechanism might have been. The calm you might expect is a damnable illusion. What truly rushes into the void is chaos, pure unadulterated chaos.",

Oh, I'm tired and I'm hungry and I'm uncomfortable and I'm wet, but mom and dad are working hard, I'd better not. I'd better not cry. , come on,. In other words, when you put your hand up, something happened between the day you were born and a few years later. When you no longer listened to your gut feelings because you couldn't afford to. Something happened. In a way, one of the things which comes across very strongly, especially in the early part of the book, is that we tend to think that children learn things when we teach them, when they get to school or when we can have a conversation with them. And very strongly in the book, what comes across is that children become who they are and learn their first moral language, as it were, before any of that. In other words, if you think that children, if you think to yourself, I shall wait until the child can speak and then I'll teach them, it's too late. They've already learned everything from what you did or didn't do. , that's. the. And as a parent, because I was quite out of touch with myself and based on my own history, I was never comfortable playing with kids. I kept thinking, , once they learn language, because I'm good at words, you see, I thought once they learn language, then I'll be able to. But I missed the whole point. It's that the real development happens before words even come along. The emotional part of the brain, the holistic, you might say more feminine, although it's not gender determined at all, holistic, the emotional part of the brain, the side of the brain, both in terms of the evolution of the species, but also in terms of the development of the individual. The side of the brain, the emotional brain develops first. And it's the template for everything. If we get the side of the brain , the left brain will follow very nicely. If we don't get the side of the brain, if we don't establish the emotional relationships which children require for healthy development, then they might become very intellectually developed on the left brain side, but they'll be very underdeveloped.",

There's a nervous system that surrounds the heart, which is in communication with this brain here. And of course, the gut has been called the second brain. The gut is more. It's more neurochemicals than the brain does in some ways. And gut feelings are not luxuries, as we've demonstrated. They're actually a form of knowledge. the gut is processing stimuli from the environment. When these three brains are in sync with each other, then you have true wisdom. Then you have true awareness. When this one is unmoored from the other two, you can have all kinds of logic and all kinds of science and all kinds of technology, but you're not going to have wisdom. Then you have a convalescent brain, and you're the one that will tell the brain that everything's and you can do whatever you want with it.

What's happened over the last few decades is this sense of choice and speed. Now we want our choices to manifest their consequences immediately. We want to choose something and we want to have it now. The idea of waiting for years to have something manifest drives us crazy. We want results immediately. Can you relate to that.

    "text": "The book and this talk is based on my work as a family physician, which I did for 20 years. And seven of those years, I was also medical coordinator of the palliative care unit at Vancouver Hospital, looking after terminally ill people, people dying of cancer, neurological diseases, and on. And what I found in all those years, learned all those years, what I had not been taught in medical school, is that who gets sick and who doesn't is not accidental. That although we tend to think on cancer and multiple sclerosis, which I mentioned last night, or rheumatoid arthritis, or chronic asthma, psoriasis, eczema, colitis, Crohn's disease, any number of chronic illnesses. There's some random events that unfortunately and mysteriously strike a person. And occasionally, we think that we can explain the cause by the lifestyle of the individual, smoking, of course, and its connection to lung cancer. But other than that, we think that these diseases are either mysterious and unexplainable misfortunes, or they are caused by people's genes. And what I found, quite on the contrary, that who gets sick and who doesn't is not accidental. And that who gets sick and who doesn't wasn't random. And that there were certain identifiable patterns, certain personality traits and ways of behaving, that people unwittingly, without knowing it unintentionally, but they brought the disease on themselves. And that wasn't their fault. They didn't know what they were doing, as you will see. But since we're talking about caregivers, and let me tell you one little fact. And since the book was published, which was about 10 years ago now, I think, or 9 years ago, there's been much more evidence tending in the same direction. One bit of evidence about caregivers is that there's a structure at the end of our DNA, our chromosomes. Chromosomes is the strands where our DNA is located in our cells, in the nucleus of our cells. And these strands of chromosomes have at the end a structure called a telomere. A telomere is the glue at the end. A telomere is the glue at the end of my shoelace to keep the strands from fraying, to keep it together. When we're born, our telomeres are a certain length. And as we get older, gradually, gradually, they shorten as we age.",

All that's happened is, is that their own stress response mechanisms have been exhausted, and now we have to give them stress hormones from the outside. Now, guess what. If you have rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, what will they give you. Cortisol, the stress hormone. Shouldn't we be asking ourselves that if we're treating people with stress hormones, whether or not there might be connection between stress and their disease. Now, of course, why the children of parents who are stressed. Because the parents' stresses actually program the physiology of the child, because you can't separate the individual from the environment. And this is true all our lives. A study of women in Australia, 500 women, 550 women, who had lumps in their breasts that were of sufficient concern as to require a biopsy. Now, they had these biopsies, but before the results came back, they also had a psychological interview or questionnaire. It turns out after the results came back that if a woman had a significant stressful incident in her life just prior to the onset of that lump, that by itself had zero effect on whether or not that lump was cancerous. Similarly, if a woman was emotionally isolated, that also had zero effect. But if a woman was emotionally isolated and had a major stressor, the risk of that lump being cancerous was nine times as great as the average. Now, the medical doctors running the study couldn't understand this one either, because they said, how does zero and zero add up to nine. You see. Because we don't understand the connection between individuals and the environment. Now, here's the deal. If I were to. Act inappropriately towards you now, if I were to stress you now, physically or emotionally, you'd have three healthy options. But. , let's see, I won't go into that now. If I were to stress you now, what would happen is that stress wouldn't just be in your head, it would be in your whole body. , your heart rate would go up, your nervous system would be firing off all kinds of impulses, your adrenal glands would be pouring adrenaline and cortisol that you could escape or fight back.

And I'm talking about a rare condition called ALS, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, which is a degenerative condition of the nervous system that leaves you very rapidly, completely paralyzed. Your mind is intact, but your body is paralyzed. And in the end, you can't breathe, and you die of respiratory failure. And now, there's a court case with somebody with ALS who wants the to medical suicide. And you remember Sue Rodriguez in Victoria, who went through the same thing, and her case was rejected in the Supreme Court. it's a very dire disease, and it carries a terrible prognosis, and most people who get it are dead within a few years. And it strikes otherwise healthy people. a woman came to me for a second opinion about 12 years ago now, actually referred to me by my friend Gordon Neufeld, a psychologist. And her story was that she'd been diagnosed with ALS by one of the leading experts in the condition in British Columbia, or in the world, actually. But she didn't want to accept the diagnosis. She wanted me to tell her that it was only stress. , it was ALS, but it was also stress. Her story was that she was a teacher and a vice principal at an elementary school in the lower mainland of BC, in Richmond. And she found at a certain point that she could no longer hold a pen in her hands because her fingers just wouldn't obey her brain's commands. She also began to experience difficulty walking. Now, you would think if that occurred to you, you would very urgently seek a medical opinion. Not her. What she did is she'd get up for months. She would get up at 5. 30 every morning, slowly get herself dressed, of course, because her fingers would have trouble buttoning or pulling zippers. She'd drive herself to school, walk into school at 7. 30 with her troubled gait. She would clutch the chalk in her clenched fist, and painstakingly scrawl the day's lesson on the board for the students. Teach the whole day, go home, stayed up late at night to prepare the next day's lesson. Everything was slow for her, you see. And next morning, get up at 5. 30.

Without any exception. Doesn't matter who I interviewed or read about. In writing this book, I also looked at the medical literature. And in 1970, there was a study at Yale University Medical School about ALS patients by two psychiatrists who wrote the following. These patients, they invariably evoked admiration and respect from all staff who came into contact with them. Characteristic was their attempt to avoid asking for help. Hard study work without recourse to help from others was pervasive. There seemed to have been habitual denial, suppression, or isolation of fear, anxiety, and sadness. no expression of negative emotions, -called. Some spoke gradually of their deterioration, or, sorry, casually, it didn't matter, or did with engaging smiles. Now then I looked up the biography of Lou Gehrig, after whom the disease is named in North America. Now those of you who are old enough might know that Lou Gehrig was a great baseball player, played for the New York Yankees in the 1930s. And he set a record for a number of hits by a New York Yankee that was only broken two years ago by Derek Jeter. that record stood for him. 80 years. Now, Gehrig set another record that stood for nearly 60 years, and that was consecutive games played. he never missed a game. Now, did he never miss a game. And he was called the Iron Horse. I didn't know about this before I read his biography. I just knew he died of ALS. Let's look at what happened to him. , same thing. He was known as the Iron Horse because he never missed a game, and he didn't never miss a game because he was never sick. He was a human being. He had flus and colds everybody else. Furthermore, being an athlete, he was injured. At one point, his hands were x-rayed, and it turned out that his fingers had been fractured 17 separate times. And each time, he would play through the injury, and his teammates would describe him as grimacing a maddened monkey in agony as he fielded the ball, but he never missed a game.",

But especially of human beings, because we're the most underdeveloped and the least mature, and the most helpless for the longest period of time of any creature on Earth. And I'll say much more about that in my talk on ADHD. Now, that means that our brains are wired for attachment. We're wired to attach. Big centers in our brains are dedicated to maintaining our attachment relationships. That's our biggest need. Those emotional centers in the brain are connected with the nervous system, because the nervous system warns us when our attachment needs are not being met, and then we cry. And then we get stressed. That's the hormonal apparatus. And all that has an impact on our immunity. Because it turns out that all these systems, the hormonal apparatus, the immune system, the nervous system, and the emotional centers in the brain are connected by the nervous system into one giant electrical grid. Fibers of the nervous system are connected to the brain. that anything that happens in one aspect of that system happens in the other aspects. they're connected. that electrical fibers or nervous fibers from the brain go to the spleen, where the red cells are stored, or to the bone marrow where they're manufactured, or to the thymus gland in the neck where immune cells mature, and back up to the brain. there's a constant neurological communication that's going on in our systems. 24-7, every second, every millisecond. That's one form of connection. The other connection is by means of chemical messengers that each of these systems secrete into the circulation. Which then travel to the other organs. that the brain reads what's happening in the body. And the body reads what's happening in the brain. In terms of that the immune cells in our circulation can manufacture every hormone that the brain can manufacture. the immune cells in your circulation are talking to the brain. And listening to the brain. That's the second connection. The third connection is the brain-gut connection. let me ask you this question. And I'll ask for a show of hands. If you've had the following experience, please just put your hand up. That is, that you had a powerful gut feeling and you ignored it and you were sorry afterwards.

No I don't mean me. I mean your child or your partner or whoever somebody. You might actually embrace them in a different situation. the role of emotions basically is to respond to approach and welcome the healthy and positive approach and to keep out the unhealthy and aggressive one. it's either I want more of this or I want less of this. that's the job of healthy anger. That's the job of the emotions. In other words it's to let in what's healthy and nourishing and to keep out what's dangerous and unwelcome. That's the job of emotions basically. Now what is the job of the immune system. basically the job of the immune system is to keep out what's unhealthy bacteria or to kill cancer cells that's what it does or to let in what's healthy. vitamins and nourishments and on. If your immune system attacked the particles of food and destroyed them before you had a chance to absorb them you wouldn't live. that the job of the immune system is that. It's been called the floating brain because it has recognition capacity reactive capacity and learning capacity. It's the same as the emotions. Immune system does the same thing as the emotions. Protect us and let in what's healthy. And that's what we need. Given the unity of all these systems it's obvious that when you suppress the one you're suppressing the other. And that's why people that suppress anger they have diminished activity of their immune system as has been shown in studies. Or what happens is that the immune system gets confused because our emotions aren't confused that it turns against ourselves. And that's when you get autoimmune disease. When the immune system actually attacks the body itself. Fundamentally what happens is one way or the other if you don't know how to say no when you need to your body will say it for you in the form of illness. chronic illness represents the body saying no when you didn't do it.

But it does mean that to prevent illness or if you have an illness to deal with it more effectively you need to learn to assert who you are and to say no. Now that might be difficult sometimes because the people in your life have got used to you as a yes. They've always heard you say yes. Some of them might not you very much if you start saying no all of a sudden. And what you're going to do when you start saying no is you're going to find out who your friends are. Because the real ones are going to say to you hey I'm glad you're finally saying no. And the ones that were simply there because you were constantly available for them are going to oh what happened to her or him. That's it.

That wasn't true when you were a kid but it's true as an adult. I'm going to finish with one story and then we'll take questions and do a couple of exercises for you. Gilda Radner you might remember her as a comedian on Saturday Night Live. And she died of ovarian cancer. And I didn't know anything about her life but I read her biography because I knew she died of cancer and guess what. It's the same story over again. Gilda Radner was a very unhappy child and she was overweight as a child and she was thin as an adult because she was bulimic. all the time that she was a star she was actually a bulimic. Typically she didn't tell her mother. Her mother didn't know that she was bulimic until after she had died. Why. Because she was still protecting her mother. Just I was with suppressing my limb. Her father died when she was 12. A loss she never overcame and what she did she always got into relationships with men where she would suppress herself to fit the image that the man had that he wanted of her. And the only way she could feel close to her mother was to make her laugh. guess what.",
