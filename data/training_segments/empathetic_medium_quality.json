    "text": "if you're dating a narcissist or you think you might be dating a narcissist this is the video for you I'm gonna go through what it looks in the beginning when everything seems fabulous and fine and great before hopefully you wake up one day kids in tow running for your life trying to get the out of the situation and yet being trapped because the truth is being with a narcissist and leaving one can often be the hardest thing you ever do at least one of them I'm hoping to spare some of you who might not recognize the signs and at the end of this video I hope you will have a greater understanding of what to look out for and more importantly consider how the hell you're going to get out now before it gets any worse if you've already experienced this and you're too far down the road I hope you will watch this video and feel free to add anything else you think I forgot but this video is really about recognizing the early signs of a narcissist before it gets far deep in and yet at the same time we know we get attached and it's hard to leave before I get started my name is Dr Kim Sage I'm a licensed clinical psychologist and I hope you will consider subscribing hitting the bell and joining this little community that's growing I am grateful to be a part of it with you guys and thankful you're starting to post and share your stories because as I keep saying it really helps us all know that it's not just us and we don't have to be long before I go through this list I want to say a couple of things one is that the odds are extremely high that you're going to get out of this situation and that's extremely high especially if you think you are a narcissist magnet or somehow you found yourself in multiple narcissistic relationships and or even if it's a pretty big one a marriage the chances are you come from a childhood where you were a caretaker where you had parents who had poor boundaries and or parents who were not emotionally available to you or you weren't physically mentally or emotionally safe and you have become really good at meeting other people's needs and facts good that you're the perfect target for a narcissist also if this is true for you might be an empath you might be a person who is in addition to your fabulous caretaking is a warm loving kind human being and that has set you up all the last thing I want to say is that it is true from the Maya Angelou quote that people show you who they are you just have to learn to believe that them and never is that more true than for recognizing the signs of a narcissist all let's get started the first sign is really about you at your core there's a very good chance you have not good enough syndrome now I say this all the time that we all have worthiness issues but some of us have more than others and this is also very true that if you are someone who deep inside your own sense of self doesn't feel good enough you're going to be deeply attracted to the narcissist in the beginning who is going to sort of a mind reader magnetize every part of you that needs to be drawn in he is going or she is going to be able to do that because of their tendency to be charming and love bombing and good at reading you will never feel seen never understood never cared for as you might in the beginning with a narcissist you also want to begin to notice as we go through these things how you feel with them do you feel overly cared for overly seen you never have before as a result of this pay attention to what it brings up in you not just focusing on how great they are the second thing I would say that's important is to look at their social media look at their online presence how do they present themselves on their website in their business with friends on Instagram whatever it is on TikTok nowadays what is it that they seem to be most comfortable talking about is it themselves is it their success and how much are they able to make it about other people in terms of what they post and what they share often because people who are narcissistic have avoidant attachment childhoods they often see dating as a game and because of their lack of being able to expose their true vulnerability they will lean in and lean out and that can be very avoidant as many of them have these types of who overly focused on achievement who weren't very good at meeting emotional needs but who were very good at meeting external needs and when you try to get you close to them and that triggers their vulnerability and their low sense of self that they don't want you to see they might pull back a little bit it kind of feels gamey in that regard and depending on your attachment style this could actually make you chase after them more because with your own needing to feel valued when they pull back you're gonna lean in and do even more for them you can feel even more seen more valuable more needed the next one is they often brag and in the beginning it can be about their car or their job they're really good at boasting and bragging and it may not be over the top and it may but just be aware of someone who is no problem talking about their accomplishments their things their achievements things that now if they're more covert narcissists they may have this element of nobody really gets me you get me and oh my god are you gonna love to hear that especially if you come to me and say oh my god I'm excited to meet you and I'm gonna love to hear that and I'm gonna love to hear that and I'm gonna love to come from a certain childhood where you didn't feel heard or understood either and it feels incredible for you both to be valued and both to be seen and that in and of itself can be a great thing but when you add it to all these other issues it often points to narcissism as opposed to deep romantic love or connection in a healthy way they're often successful narcissists often do they're often climb the ladder quickly they're often at the top looking down as they love to on everyone else and this can be something that you might want to pay attention to and you're not going to be pay attention to and you're not going to be attention to it especially if you are wanting to be with somebody who can take care of you not just emotionally but financially this feels oh this person is got it going on I can be an equal in that or I can be the partner and support that and just pay attention to that sign next one is they often will describe all their exes as crazy and if you watch my videos or me that I think it's really unfair we often call women crazy but not men and if all their exes are crazy that bitch was crazy my ex-wife is crazy no it doesn't work that if you're a man you're a woman you're a woman you're a man you're a man that if you're choosing all crazy people then there's something crazy going on with you now it may just be that we're broken and wounded but don't let them tell you that they're fine and great it's just all their exes that are messed up that's definitely a red flag you often have few friends if they do they're more worshippers or followers very rare true deep connections with other people because that would require reciprocity and they have a difficult time with that they often have poor boundaries whether this is showing up at your place and announce which seems a romantic comedy in the beginning but it's not because you're a woman you're a man you're a man you're a woman you're a man you're a man you're a man you're a man you're a man or they are just pursuing you way too much too soon and love bombing you and that feels much attention but it's also disrespecting at times what's really going on with you what you need what you want and how you really feel poor boundaries they're often envious of others and jealous even of you but in the beginning they often mask this and it can seem I just really care about you or the flip side to that is often I'm not jealous why would I be jealous there's no one as good as I am which is in the beginning it doesn't come off that you're a woman you're a man you're a man you're a man you're a man you're a man you're a man you're a man you're a man it comes off really boastful and confident and if you are someone who struggles with your own self-esteem that can be really magnetic wow this person is really confident they're not worried the next one is if they make you question yourself and you feel a little crazy the way you remember things the way you think about how something happened they're good at gaslighting and flipping the situation and in the beginning they're not going to be as overt about it I mean some might those are more obvious but these are more this collection of signs where you just start to go scratching your head I don't really remember it that way but and it starts to feel that way pretty often that can be concerning as I said before if you come from a caretaker background your own childhood certainly if you had narcissists in your own family or borderlines any of those sort of PDS where there is a general lack of boundary respect there's a general just way of being in the world that is sort of toxic but yet feels normal because you're used to that toxicity you may not recognize that it's not healthy the next one is of course they're not great at feedback or criticism and yet in the beginning you might not really engage in that you might watch how they receive it from other people how do they engage with others this is a huge sign how do they treat people that they perceive as below them whether it's waiters or administrators or there goes maple or assistants or gardeners they have this hierarchy in their mind of who's at the top and it really is important to watch how they treat other people it's not a cliche and you will see them oftentimes act out their narcissistic rage and other people which seems justified oh she's tired he was tired or they went through a hard time but pay attention how they treat other people and when they navigate that anger with other people they've been you will see that tantruming which oftentimes I said in the beginnings kind of seems justified but eventually the tantrum will be to you and as a result of you and directed at you obviously they can be mean to others but the same time they're not going to show this one necessarily allow and that kind of goes with how they treat other people that sort of lack of care for others they can be entitled and powerful and as I said before they often are successful and that is a way that you think it makes sense they're at the top they can't kiss everyone's ass and you have respect but it's this sort of way of disregarding others and you will see them do that if you pay attention they love to talk about themselves and they can often be really good storytellers they're used to captivating an audience I find they're often attractive people who were born genetically attractive and I always say that it goes back to the playground if you get reinforced for let's say your look you're the cute little boy and all the girls are chasing you and you start to lead with that oftentimes narcissists will wield whatever genetic gifts or talents they've been given whether it's their success or power looks or money and because those things in and of themselves often bring followers they learn to really cultivate that sense of themselves even more these are those people who are posing you and seem fabulous and get lots of attention and then they know how to use that to work a room and as a result of that they can be very captivating.",

    "text": "And the last one is they can be condescending and a little passive-aggressive in the beginning. Now eventually it can become much more direct but in the beginning it's little pokes here, little jokes there, little sarcasm there, oh you're cute when you're chubby or whatever it is, something along those lines. And they can be very conditional in terms of what they expect because you are a reflection of them. They want to have the most beautiful women, the most beautiful men, the most successful people, those in the best shape. Everyone is a reflection of them including you and you have to understand that there's a condition to that and that your value is only based on what you can give them, what you represent for them, or what you reflect for them. Not necessarily what you feel from them and what they feel from you. It's all about the outside and making them feel more powerful, more successful, more loved, and sadly more alone at the end of it because they often do end up alone. If you are dating a narcissist I highly encourage you, especially if you are married and have children, and even if you don't have children, leading them can be very difficult. if there's any way to get support I would really encourage you to do that. If you're in a relationship now and you're , God these things are kind of true but I love him, I love her, I'm attached, still consider therapy or talking to someone, working through this, getting books, reading, , listening to podcasts to begin to understand that the deeper you go these issues will not get better. They will only get worse and more difficult and painful for you. All guys, I hope you will find this video helpful. Please don't forget to subscribe and hit the bell and feel free to post whatever you think I forgot. Thanks much for watching. Stay safe and I will see you next time. Bye. Bye.",

    "text": "How can somebody escape the victim mindset. , if I was talking to a person that, I would say, first of all, I get it because I've been to that place myself. I mean, I've had moments when I didn't think life was worth living and I imagined my own suicide. Never that I planned it or I was going to do it, but I kind of fantasized it,. I've been to those places, I get it. Secondly, I would say, I feel that the world's against me. That's not a feeling. It's a belief,. If you have that belief, it's because at some point you had that experience. But you're not having that experience now. That experience was that of a child who was helpless and alone. what's showing up in your belief system is not your present situation, but your childhood emotional experience. And I said before, in the present, we can heal. No matter what happened then, we can heal in the present. the first thing I would ask a person that is, are you willing to consider that healing is possible for you. Or have you totally given up. By the way, a person who's totally given up wouldn't be telling you this. Because when people talk this way, whether they know it or not, they're asking for help. If they weren't asking for help, they wouldn't say anything. They'd just slink off on their own and isolate themselves. And some people do. anybody who speaks the way that you just cited is already, whether they know it or not, they're looking for help. And if that's the case, then they can be helped. And that's the second point is, don't try and solve this on your own. We're human beings. We're creatures that evolved in connection and community. You're not alone with this. It may feel you're alone. And you certainly might feel lonely. But you're not, in fact, alone. Millions feel exactly the same way. And they're not crazy. And you're not crazy. Those beliefs and feelings are normal responses to abnormal circumstances. that's how I begin working with the people, with the person, with that mindset.",

Or I can just be disappointed and let go of it and say, , , thanks. , there'll be another day. how I respond is not dependent on the external event. It's dependent on what charge I'm carrying. triggers are wonderful times to learn about yourself. if you ask the question, , why did I react that way. But, huh, I wonder why I reacted that way. Now, there's a whole lot of learning to be done. that's what I'll call compassionate curiosity, where we're actually curious about ourselves, but not in a self-judgmental way, but in a compassionate way. Oh, this brought up the pain of rejection. Obviously, I'm still carrying that wound. , let's look at that because it's not happening in the present. I'm glad you brought that up in that we have to change the language and how we talk to ourselves during those moments because for me personally, I'm extremely hard on myself. that voice that you were saying, , , , why is this happening or why is it doing this to me. , that's something that I've said in my life very, very frequently because of the fact that I'm really hard on myself. I sometimes, when something doesn't go my way or when I get triggered or bothered by something, even though I've done it, I've done a lot of work on myself. I'm hard on myself because I'm , gosh, I'm better than this. I know I should be doing better than this. that was really eye-opening for me. thanks for sharing that. , and , that voice in your head that tells you all that stuff. In this book, I actually talk about getting into a relationship with that voice because this is what I call a stupid friend, , because at some point that voice came along when you were quite small. See, if you were suffering as a kid or things weren't going , there's two assumptions the child could make unconsciously. One is, the world is dangerous. My parents don't know how to love me, value me. I can't trust anybody. I'm all alone. I'm going to suffer in this world. The other belief unconsciously is, there's something wrong with me and maybe if I work hard enough, I can fix it.",

And you have, of course, in mainstream medicine, you have specialists. I'm a specialist for the liver, specialist for this and this and that. Not only not taking into account the totality of the body, but more importantly, not taking into account the totality of the person, which includes the physical body and the mind. it's vitally important to discover, first of all, that there is a voice in your head that indulges in self-talk most of the time.",

An agreeable person is someone with an agreeable personality. a narcissistic personality is a personality that's characterized by low empathy. I don't say no empathy, but low empathy. They know how to turn it on when they need to,. Charming. They can be charming. They can be,. it's low empathy that sort of is there, and sometimes it's not. Entitlement. Arrogance. Pathological selfishness. An excessive need for admiration. And I say excessive. We all want to be admired. Sure, of course. But this is an excessive need for admiration. And if they don't get it, they get really angry. There is. They don't manage strong emotions. There's no frustration tolerance. people who are narcissistic are either raging at you if you don't do or say exactly what they want, or there's a passive-aggressive withholding, withdrawing, sort of silent treatment. these are personalities where relationships are really about control and dominance. But what I always say is that all that stuff, the entitlement, the arrogance, the grandiosity, I'm great. Look at me. I'm charming. It's all covering this deeper insecurity and shame. And that anytime that insecurity or shame threatens to percolate up in the narcissistic person, that's when you see the attack. Now, it could be that your -called attack is as simple as saying, hey, could you pick up the kids today. You want me to pick up the kids. Do you not think my time is valuable. I run a damn company. it's , that's not an insult. That's , could you pick up the kids. you could never know where it's coming from. When you talk about tiptoe, it's another level.

    "text": "if a person might have grown up with a narcissistic parent and they've already grown up learning to make themselves small and now they're in a relationship and it's sort of part two of this and it continues for a lifetime do people with narcissistic parents seek this kind of relationship don't seek it and that's no interest that's one thing I that's one myth I'd love to bust is that I think this whole sense of course I found this person they're just my mother I said no you didn't go out looking for this I don't buy the masochist theory what I buy is that the narcissistic people are often super smart confident charming charismatic attractive put together they're the they're at often time the archetype of what look good looks good on paper or they just manage to mesh with some sort of core wound you have they pick out that thing and they know to just compliment you on it or say you gosh your family told you're not that smart I think you're smart it doesn't have to be that way it's just a matter of how you deal with it doesn't have to be a dozen roses it can just be that healing or temporary healing it feels of a core wound because of that in the in I think everyone's attracted to a narcissistic person what I always say to folks is if you came from a narcissistic family of origin or had a narcissistic parent it's not that you're more likely to draw a narcissistic person or be attracted to them it's that you're more likely to get stuck in the relationship because it's normalized you're you're oh you have to chase love and no one's ever gonna love me unconditionally there's that interesting feel but we do make the mistake Tamsen of I think one of the big mistakes I see out there on social media is that we only talk about the grandiose form of narcissism the charming charismatic arrogant the obvious but there's different subtypes of narcissism and that's why some people you said I don't even know the word or I didn't think this applied there are because of there are these different kinds of narcissism there are people out there in very toxic narcissistic relationships but because it doesn't sort of conform to this charming charismatic kind of narcissism we miss it I think that this isn't as simple as somebody walking around bragging about themselves arrogant it can be but it's not always Dr Armani can we go through what are some of those other kind of stereotypes we know what to look for because I want people at the end of this to know how to define it know what to look for and if they do spot that they're in that type of relationship to at least be able to acknowledge it find that vocabulary that not all of us have had and figure out a way to get out or get help one thing I want to make clear is number one it's not an either or a person it's not that a person's narcissistic or not it's not black or white narcissism thing first of all narcissism is on a continuum and frankly at the mild end it feels more an emotionally stunted emotionally immature superficial almost ridiculous person it's the 50 year old person who still wants to play their video games and throw a tantrum when you ask them to empty the dishwasher that is a milder narcissism and some people say I would have loved better but I don't feel I'm psychologically unsafe I'm annoyed when we get to the severe end of narcissism though Tamsin it can be downright dangerous these are people who might isolate a partner take a tremendous advantage of them financially abuse them there might even be physical abuse the manipulation is at a very high level and it can feel very hard to escape most people and in fact my book it's not used really written about that moderate part it doesn't look a sort of a terrifying story nor is it just somebody who won't empty the dishwasher it's definitely taking a psychological toll on people that's the whole spectrum of it but within that spectrum there are also subtypes our kind of dictionary definition of narcissism is that grandiose sort of swagger narcissist but there's also a form of narcissism it's called vulnerable narcissism some people call it covert narcissism it doesn't show up as narcissism it shows up as sort of an angry aggrieved sullen passive-aggressive why don't I get my chance I feel everyone's taking advantage of me nothing is fair to me that it doesn't show up as narcissism and their partners are always they kind of feel bad for them nothing is going their way sometimes it's pity is harder to leave in a way because you're gosh this relationship is exhausting and they blame me for everything because that's a key thing in narcissism is they blame the other person nothing's ever their responsibility there's no accountability and then when we use this term covert narcissism I would argue that all narcissism is covert and by what I mean by that is it doesn't show up when other people are around you're at the dinner party and a lot of people think you're either with this really smart person or interesting person or put together person or just clever person but as soon as you get out of that circumstance they're really cruel to you but then there's no one witnessing this but the vulnerable narcissism has more of a negative effect on you and you're not going to be able to just be able to keep looking at this and now that I'm saying that I'll let what it is that's going on maybe it's something that's more of a socially anxious hostile angry thin-skinned kind of a feel then there's malignant narcissism which is that more severe narcissism which is coercive and manipulative and exploitative and scary that's a dangerous that's all the way to the end and then there's forms of narcissism that I don't think we talk about enough that come up a lot and one of them is what we call communal narcissism and communal by being perceived as do-gooders and rescuers.",

And I have to say, again, from a therapist chair. Sure. I'm not telling anybody, say roll in the room and say, , I'm telling you now, you're with a narcissistic person.

It's interesting you're blaming yourself for that because da-da, da-da, da-da. , we're almost helping the client become their own detective. Instead of just plopping that in the middle of the room. Because, Tamsin, to be frank with you, if I just walked up to someone and say, yo, your boyfriend or your husband's narcissistic, they would shut down and they would close me out. Because they've been in an unhealthy relationship for a long time and they're really used to rationalizing it. , I've got to find the back door. And really say, are you. That seems hurtful.

Are you. , you're coming in with empathy, but also awareness , that was not cool. And then that helps them sort of create a more elaborate picture. Tamsin, if someone's in one of these relationships long enough, they think what's happening in this relationship is normal. , people will say, oh, that's not normal. , that's not what other people are going through.

A lot of dating has now moved into online. And the idea of the dating platform has been a lot of work. And I think that there is a lot of work being done in the dating platform. And I think that there's a lot of work being done in the dating platforms, which, if you're not accustomed to that space, let me tell you, narcissistic people can really rule the roost when it comes to dating platforms. They're great at creating the grid, and , look at me, puppies, abs, my tourist pictures. I'm fit. I'm this. They say the things because it's such a curated space. And that I've seen. And I think the idea of the dating platform is that if you don't have healthy conversations about women in midlife, perimenopause, menopause, starting new relationships. We put all of us out on an ice floe, and this desexualized ice floe, by the way, that you're not going to want to meet someone. And why would we even want to talk about this. Or I don't know. I mean, I would love to hear your thoughts about this. I don't know. We have a cultural moment. I don't the Golden Bachelor, but it still felt tongue in cheek. It was ha. It was very ha. I know we were happy to see. Look, I think we wanted people to be represented in media, but not that way. Not that way. it became almost it was a sideshow act. And it felt disrespectful. And because of all that, any time people might feel they're dating or meeting partners in a more, I don't know, they're ashamed to talk about it, that can happen in midlife too. that's one setup for people getting into narcissistic relationships.

Because that's always something that's dangled in the relationship even before all of this began. And to me, the greatest tragedy, Tamsen, is that people think that, I've got to stick this out, because who's going to take care of me when I'm older. And I said, sweetie, let me tell you who ain't going to take care of you when you're older is him. there is this sense of, , if I leave this, then I could be alone. And I said, that's a different conversation. But if you're thinking that you've put some form of psychological money in the bank, Some coin, , you deposited coins that are going to come back to you. And they're going to be there for you if your aging process ends up resulting in more health problems earlier, oh, heck no. You would be better off cultivating your friendships and other supports than you would on relying on this person to be any form of caregiver. And Tamsen, that's real. That is very real.

I can't tell you how many women I've worked with, especially people who are in long-term narcissistic relationships, who went through the nightmare of those divorces, and then finally set up their own residence and all of that. And they feel such a sense of calm, being in a home where they don't have to wait for when my partner comes home. And they'll say, I don't know that I ever want someone in my space again.

And in this particular case, I'm thinking something of in his home, but sometimes hers. But she said, it's just given me a place that I needed after all those years to regulate. My point being, by midlife, you have enough data to know what works for you. Trust that. How do we give women permission to do that and get off the timeline train. Because we're basically going back to the timeline again. Yes, we are. But now we're in midlife on the timeline. It's not the timeline of getting married, having babies, excelling at the career.

And that's how we are in a narcissistic relationship very quickly. And that's how I think we can push back on the timelines, which is, what do you really want. And where is this pressure coming from, too. Sometimes it's coming from friends who are saying, get out there now. You got a date or you're going to be alone forever. In some cases, it could be watching how it played out in a family of origin. They'll say, oh, my mom died alone someplace, and I don't want that to be my story. it's paying attention to, just because your mom died alone on her own in her home, that doesn't necessarily mean you rushing into a relationship is going to be the answer to that, to have the grief over that. But that's not the reason to get into a relationship. It's to look to, where are these narratives coming at. Because there's narratives, and we've had them our whole life. I want to go back to menopause, because I think when we talk about menopause and perimenopause, narcissists can use that in many different ways. You're moody, you're hormonal, your hormones are talking, you don't want to have sex with me anymore, you might not find me attractive. Am I saying all those too fast. Oh, you got them all. I heard every single one of them. How do women first, I guess, identify those. Because they're already feeling that way. it's a very easy ramp up for a narcissist. A menopausal woman can be very easy for a narcissist. What do you tell women that come in there with that. Because they're already feeling that way. They're feeling hormonal. They're feeling moody. They might not want to have sex. There's a lot that happens during this time. Where do you start that conversation with a woman and feeling invisible on top of all that. the most dangerous place to be in a narcissistic relationship or enter a narcissistic relationship from is to feel, is to devalue yourself, is to feel devalued.

But what you're instead doing is you're giving them ammunition, quite sadly. I think, sadly, there's nothing you can do in the relationship. And the things you're doing, Tamsyn, and this podcast and all of that, is for us to have healthier conversations. Because you've been asking about timelines, for example. Young women grow up with Disney nonsense and fairy tales. And I'm going to find the guy, and he's going to fall head over heels. And now it's Instagram, the romance, the nonsense people see on Instagram about relationships and all that stuff. We don't even have fairy tales for older people. I guess they're the witch. I think that's what happens. It's always implied. Maleficent. Maleficent was really old. Or that lady with the tentacles, Ursula. We think they're old people. I'm imagining they're the equivalent of menopause in a fairy tale. I'm sure they are. I'm sure somebody had a ha-ha about that. And I've had my Ursula moments with this. , me too. I've had my Maleficents. I think that the issue then becomes exactly what you're talking about, which is, how do you feel about your menopausal body. How do you feel about yourself.

It's all your brain fog and all this other stuff. Now we got it. Now, of course, you don't understand what I'm saying. once again, you're being- I can feel that. , of course. You're being treated in a diseased, pathologized manner. And you're the one with the problem. You're the one with the problem because of your hormones, because of your body changes.

Let's talk about the damage of a replacement partner when a narcissist replaced, and this often happens in midlife, a younger partner for the current or older one. What does that do to somebody. a lot of things. Actually, I've talked about this on YouTube. I have actually a video called the replacement neurosis. A couple of things happens. Some people have a core wound around this,. Around feeling replaced. It might've even happened in their family of origin,. When you no longer did what the narcissistic parent wants, that all of a sudden they're , we have no use for you, but we're gonna focus on your other sibling. The idea of being replaced by another human being, I don't care who you are. It's a devastating feeling. No one's replaceable, but there's nothing a narcissistic relationship to feel you are. Grandiose narcissistic, partners will very often already have their new person queued up. There's always that tiny bit, they are not jumping into the great unknown. They're gonna make sure that they're covered and that they've kind of taken a test drive. And then and only then will they take you down and trade you in,. And there's often already that sense of betrayal that was there. that's pretty common. And even if that's not the case, that there is actually a discernible break, and then a new person comes in, and then you go, oh, I'm just gonna take this person and I'm gonna make sure that they're safe. But the thing is, narcissistic people will do this in a boundaryless, cruel, unempathic way. They will try to create the new family away. They'll try to pull the children you had with them immediately into this new sort of family, version two kind of thing. They'll have it all over social media way too quickly.

They'll find someone who's got money, who's got stuff, who's got status, who's got whatever. it could be those things. may not necessarily be that this person is younger, but maybe they got a lot of money from a former divorce or a career or something or an inheritance. again, we're talking about midlife. A better them thing. A better them thing. A better them thing. Whatever that is. Home, whatever the status thing is. for the person who has been either left for, or they've gotten a divorce and then it's down the road that this happens, it can very much feel a whole new life has come out of this. And many people will report not only the sense of betrayal, if it was in fact an overlap, but also watching friends kind of divide their loyalties. And people will say, am I being irrational. That I am mad. That my friend went to their new house for dinner after my friend knows that my partner was psychologically cruel. I said, no, it's not irrational.

They were hacking it up in the wandering eyes and the twitches. They were all out there watching me pull in. And I had learned from being on the road enough that it was me and my dog that when you go and some possible danger in the people that are around, you've got to watch how you get out. You've got to watch how you drive. You've got to watch how deliberately you back that thing up. You've got to watch how you get out of the car, how you walk deliberate, how you get your shoulders back.

And while they're over there a half mile away with the binoculars, just enough to hopefully have them go, , maybe let's pick the next guy. what I mean. And that night, I slept there and went to bed. And I woke up at 4 AM to this sound. And of course, I already had it in my mind, in case they come down to break it. It wasn't them. Unbeknownst to me, it pulled up six feet away from a train rail.

Or your blue sweater doesn't work with my purple shirt. That's really what it is. , there you go. The next thing is empathy deficits. And here's where I will know that I'm going to do better than the DSM, the diagnostic and statistical manual on this. The DSM kind of takes I think the lazy way on just says it's a lack of empathy. But it's not a lack of empathy. I think that's the simple way out. It is low empathy, cognitive empathy, performative empathy, and transactional empathy. That's narcissism. And by that, I mean, it's variable empathy to that's key. Narcissist. , this is crucial. , because narcissists are people, this is stuff I've expanded on from everybody else's. Oh, very cool. Especially the transactional variable. It's a transactional performative piece. , because here's the thing. Narcissistic people are not devoid of empathy, they cannot be or they would never be as successful as they are, they have to be able to read the room. And to be able to read the room, they have to be aware of the room. it's, it's in some ways, it's some of the emotional intelligence we see that drive sales, but it's something different than that. When the narcissistic person feels safe, stable, valued and important. They're actually quite empathic. They're good. In essence, the day they get the raise, the day they get the funding, the day they get whatever it is that they want just temporary, it's temporary. this is how you can see how this will confuse a partner. Because on the day the good stuff comes, they wrap their arms around the partner and swing around the kitchen. Baby, let's go to Hawaii. Baby, I'm lucky to have you my god, the house looks amazing. You look amazing. That reads as empathy. It's not. It's a bit of a grandiose fairy tale for a minute. It feels a person's being seen or heard. And the wife might even say, Oh, I'm happy. Gosh, I had a tough day at work. You did baby tell me about your tough day at work.",

Because if the person is a very optimistic person is supplied, then they look empathic. But they also have the capacity to understand how someone feels. I always say it's classically what I say call it crying at the movie. They can watch a movie and they're crying at a scene that's evocative or sad,. They're not cold. They're not psychopathically cut off from that scene. They're crying. It's a sad scene. It might even be that the dog comes home to its owner. there is a they get emotion, I understand why that would be hard for you. But it's not that emotional kind of hug around a person or doing what they need. It's a very intellectualized experience. narcissistic people also are very socially perceptive. That also falls into this empathy world because they're able to read what people need. And they know, empathy reads to the world. in public, they will be quite performatively empathic, , oh my gosh, , see what a hard time they're going through. And it'll all seem Oh, isn't that also many fields there. And it's transactional. They'll show empathy and say, , we talked about your feelings. Aren't we good. Now let's flip the script. I've done my little empathy currency for the day. That's the picture of empathy. And because it's not an absence of it. A lot of people will say, , they actually did ask me how I felt. And they did listen to the answer. Doesn't that qualify. That's why you're separating lack of empathy with low empathy. Correct. empathy, performative empathy, transactional empathy, manipulative empathy. empathy is the ability to experience another person's state, and to be aware of how your behaviors impact another person, and to be able to create a mental model of what someone else is going through in real time. And then, just to be clear, compassion would be taking action from that state.",

But today we're going to be discussing one of the most powerful tools that I know of to use to heal after betrayal trauma. It's called the polyvagal theory, and it really provides a helpful model to understand what's going on inside your body, how trauma really wires or kind of wreaks havoc, on your nervous system. And the polyvagal theory can really break down a very complex system into a simple way to help you reincorporate tools, everyday practices that can help you feel you are regaining control and agency in your life, in your body, in your mind, in your emotions, again, because any of you, pretty much most of you are here because you've been through some kind of relationship crisis. And I want to talk to you about some of the tools that you can use to heal after betrayal trauma. And I think you can all understand this feeling that your body's just taken over, that you just don't feel you have control of your thoughts and your emotions and everything. And you really grieve the loss of that. this polyvagal theory can help you a lot with that particular problem. being betrayed by a trusted loved one can be one of the most traumatizing experiences.

And of course, there's always these stories too, that it's , what if I share what my partner did to me. And then we say, oh, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

Another sign and symptom is what I'd already talked about, difficulty trusting, not just your partner, not just other people, but yourself. Hey, I married this person, clearly I can't tell when someone is lying. It's this very scary idea that I don't have the basic skills to keep myself alive and safe, and it turns you upside down. there's difficulty even just trusting yourself. Problems with intimacy. This can happen in multiple ways. Intimacy happens not just physically through sex and hugs and kisses, but it can happen emotionally. It can happen spiritually, intellectually. You will struggle with wanting to share intimacy with everybody on all fronts, spiritually, intellectually. You don't want to share your opinions because you don't trust your opinions. Emotions. Sometimes after all this gouging. Gaslighting and manipulation. You have these shame stories going on that you want too much. You ask for too much. This whole package is just too much. you're constantly questioning what is too needy. What do I need to ask for. you really, really hold back on intimacy, on showing yourself to other people, on being authentic and connected with people, which again is very opposite of what you need. You need to heal. But in addition to the symptoms I just said, there's also thematic symptoms.",

Song can trigger intrusive memories. A flashback. Your partner may be actually on the mend and repairing and then all of a sudden you're just , get away, you monster. Don't touch me. You're a horrible person. And then a thing that we're going to talk about mainly here now is this difficulty. With emotional regulation. You can feel almost a teenager again or a toddler again where they just kind of throw themselves on the ground and they're having a tired, overwhelmed tantrum because they just don't know how to come up with their feelings to speak it, to share it. And sometimes betrayed partners feel that. They just feel out of control and their inability to kind of reel it in and help themselves feel. Safe and soothed again. here's the Bali bagel theory in a nutshell. What I really about it is again, we think this, the, the autonomic nervous system, we all have it. You don't want to wipe it away. I know when we're in crisis and it feels it is driving this crazy train and we can't get off and it's scary and we want to crawl out of our skin. We feel stressed and overwhelmed all the time. We wish that we didn't have this survival system, but we still want the survival system to help us jump out of the way of a car. That's moving too fast. That has a reflex that pushes down on the opposite leg. When we step on something sharp with one leg, , we want these reflexes and responses, but we also want to constantly keep in mind that we have this thing called the prefrontal cortex. It is the higher functioning version of us. Of this and thank God for it because it can. It's a little bit more complicated than it is. It's a little bit more complex than it is. But it's a little bit more complicated than it is. I want you to realize that. And I want you to realize that. And I want you to realize that. , Stephen Porges.",

It is running on the backdrop all the time. every time you enter a room, every time you open your eyes or hear anything, it is all about listening first and foremost, noting threats. Who's moving in a funny way. Tones of voice. Nonverbal cues. Looking around in our environment. Hearing things. These are all things that are constantly running around in the background trying to say, , is there a threat. How do I keep myself safe. he says there's essentially three phases to the nervous system. I guess hierarchy. He says first there's the ventral vagal state. ventral vagal is we're social. We're engaged. let's say we're talking to a good friend. Or we're in a meeting and engaged in the meeting. Or we're having a good time and doing something fun with some family. This is the safe, social, connected, engaged phase. This is when we're able to be present. When my prefrontal cortex is able to be Kristen. When I can think about consequences. When I can think about who am I and how do I want to show up. , doing actually real intimacy, I said. Physical, emotional, intellectual, spiritual connection. The different senses that I'm Studied from. Absolutely. Sometimes that's kind of hard to say or flavors it for some reason, although it kind of feels I'm capsule kind of spending time with myself, because I'm thinking to myself, all this is expensive now, that. My prefrontal cortex is obviously highly hyperactive now grind. And it's allCA mów oo and DXA.

Cause remember you don't have control of the environment, but you have control of yourself and what you want to do in these moments of crisis. first get to know your nervous system. The second is start identifying skills for up and down regulation. a thing that I definitely have on my website is it's called a self-care menu. It's on kristinsnowden. com. And these are just a list of potential up and down regulation,. if I'm in dorsal vagal and I'm in shutdown mode and I'm sleeping and I'm not moving, these are lists of some of these things that I need to do to re-engage the world to upregulate myself. Conversely, if I am hypervigilant running around, feeling I'm running around with my, a chicken with my head cut off, feeling overwhelmed, feeling victimized, feeling I can never just get through this. You can start using some of these tactics, to downregulate what we call engage the parasympathetic state, sympathetics up, parasympathetic down. A little note, by the way, the most accessible intervention is always breathing. Little fact, when you breathe in, you upregulate your sympathetic system. When you exhale, you downregulate, upregulate, downregulate. stopping and reminding yourself that your breath in and of itself, can up and downregulate is fantastic. And then there's also these grounding techniques. If you've seen my webinars before, I to trick my brain into getting into higher functioning thought. If you stay curious, ask questions, and then go through some complex concepts, it throws your brain into higher functioning systems that it can't be in that fight, flight, freeze state. my client, my clients always laugh, but I say, start counting backwards from 100 by seven. , just try it. No one can just run through it quickly. But you have to think about that. Or, , start naming the things that you see in the room, feel your butt in the seat, do that deep breathing.",

If someone isn't available at the beginning, they're not going to become available later. In fact, it usually gets worse. All , the second category of red flags is they are manipulative. And this one is tricky because it doesn't always look manipulation at first. let's say they start talking about other people they've slept with. They drop little references to their past hookups or ongoing situationships. Maybe they mention an ex they still talk to sometimes. Or maybe they just don't. Maybe they're a friend they once dated but now just have a special connection with. They make you feel you're the one being insecure if you question it. If you want to know, wait a minute, what exactly is this relationship. And when you try to talk about your boundaries, they get annoyed. You're being too intense. You're ruining the vibe. You're being very expectations-y. Maybe they say they want to see you and they even pick a weekend, but then they don't follow up. Or they keep you waiting. Or they cancel at the last minute. Again and again. And somehow, you end up feeling the needy one for expecting them to show up when they said they would show up. They joke about being in love with you. Haha. And then five minutes later, they say they just want to be friends. They talk to you're their soulmate one day. And they ignore your texts the next day. This roller coaster. It's not romantic, is it. It's not passion. It's not just chemistry. It's control. They're controlling you and they're keeping you off balance. And that's not an accident because if you're confused, you're easier to manipulate. You're more likely to ignore your gut and you're more likely to stick around that they can have what they want despite your needs being ignored or trampled. And that's exactly how trauma bonding begins. All. The third category of red flag is they have flags that are not just red. They're screaming red alert. You're not alone. And this is the easiest to spot, but somehow it's the easiest to go into denial about. The red alert category. These are the signs that would make any bystander say, , that's not normal.",

And even though you feel sick inside, you just go along with it and you don't fight back. they interpret that as permission. They ask to borrow money. They need money now. They've got a sob story or a situation or a big opportunity. And somehow you feel you're the only person who understands them or they show up drunk or high, or they start acting strange during the date. They're stubborn. They're not going to get off their feet. They're not going to get off their feet. They're not going to get off their feet. They're not going to get off their feet.

Then one day they lie. Maybe it's something small, a white lie about a dinner bill. They don't correct the server when they're undercharged or they ask you to help them deceive someone. Can you just say we're friends if my ex calls or can you say that you're my employer. I'm applying for unemployment. Or can you pretend I wasn't here. This is not just bad behavior. This is a character problem. And if they're willing to lie to other people, don't fall into the trap of thinking, oh, you're in on their little secret. You guys are a little too some because they will lie to you. Now if you stay, you become complicit, not because you're a bad person, but because it feels easier to stay than to face the truth.

Inconsistency, you call it mystery. And when someone shows you disrespect, you call it, , edginess. And when someone is emotionally unavailable, you feel the thrill of the chase and you mistake that for chemistry. That's not your fault. People who were traumatized as children often struggle with this regulation and this kind of misappropriation of attachment to somebody who's not a good person to attach to. When you're attached to someone, you're not a good person to attach to. When you're attached to someone, you're not a good person to attach to.

    "text": "Everyone is talking about dysregulation, but what does that mean and what can you do when it happens to you. I'm exactly the person to answer this for you. I even wrote a book about it, re-regulated. Dysregulation is a reaction. It can come up in response to stressors and it's especially common for people who have been through intense stress in the past, trauma. Now, everyone, not just traumatized people, get dysregulated sometimes and virtually everyone eventually re-regulates. But if you were traumatized at a young age, it can cause you to get dysregulated more easily than other people and to stay dysregulated longer. you can think of a newborn baby who is in distress. Their skin is red, they arch their back, , they're crying. And newborns they haven't yet learned to regulate and this is what it looks. They're born unable to regulate themselves. When their mom holds and feeds them, they will calm themselves. They come down. They're not desperate anymore. They're not in dysregulated crying. They're feeling calm and comforted. And then they come out alert and re-regulated. That's what it feels to get re-regulated. For a baby, the love, the food, and the contact with the mother's body help their nervous system to co-regulate. Co-regulate. You may have heard that term where you can match your nervous system regulation to someone else's. it's very normal in kids. But adults do it together too, or groups of people even. And you can see why a lack of attentive care can harm normal development of a child's nervous system and their ability to self-regulate. You can also see how parents who are themselves dysregulated struggle to help a kid to get regulated. The baby continues to cry, , for example, and it can't settle down. And this in turn can further dysregulate the parent. And then the parent is dysregulated. It dysregulates the baby and back and forth and back and forth. It's a vicious cycle. Now once what dysregulation is and you're aware of the feeling, you may be having, aha, that kind of moment, you might begin to notice dysregulation everywhere. that guy yelling at the post office clerk. He was dysregulated. Your mom, when she saw the mess everyone made and she started crying, she was dysregulated.",

Do you have this. If you're a lot of us, it can be a huge relief to know that dysregulation, it's a thing. It's a thing and it's normal for people who have been through a lot. Here's what it can feel in adults. You feel spaced out. You're at a loss for words. You can't remember where you are for a minute. Or you feel scattered.

And those are very important to health and dysregulation can be disruptive to your health. the signs that you can feel are a good sign that there might be dysregulation on many levels.

Maybe the praise you received was later for a job done or a brave action you took or for a thoughtful gift you gave. The person who praised you helped you see what was good about you and that was their way to bring more good into the world. There is good in the world but some people have a way of bringing more. think of someone who got you out of danger at some point.",

Some parents aren't even saying anything and they're just not really there or they're literally not there. if that's what happened to you, it wouldn't be surprising at all if social situations are really stressful for you as an adult. It's hard to have confidence in yourself when the way you relate to people had to be invented by a little kid, not by the -adjusted grownups teaching you, but by you. Without parents who've lived with you for long, you're not going to be able to do anything. And , if you're not listening to you, your social development can end up having big holes in it. , chunks are missing. And of course, you're going to struggle sometimes as a result of that. what are the signs that someone wasn't listened to as a child. One is you may get anxious and angry when you try to put feelings into words, especially with people who you depend on, an employer or a teacher or a partner. Now, maybe you've repeated a pattern and unconsciously chosen people who are not listening to you. But if you're not listening to them, you're not going to be able to get what you need. And , you're going to have a lot of fear. You're going to have a lot of fear that you're going to be dismissed or ignored or belittled or not heard, that your voice comes out angry. That's a sign. And as you've probably noticed, getting wound up and angry when you're trying to say what you need tends to ruin your chances of getting what you need. Walking into interactions, , sure that you're not going to get what you need can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. You can actually become someone who is in fact hard to listen to. And this is a horrible feeling because you're trying to connect and say what's going on, but then you're also feeling shame that you can't seem to do it. , it's a double whammy. And this is really normal for people with childhood PTSD. But you might be someone who goes the other way. Instead of getting angry or anxious, you might lapse into fawning and people-pleasing. You're sure you won't be heard or cared about that you try to manipulate a good outcome.",

You could be fawning by dancing around and proving how nice you are and how helpful you are and how many questions you ask about the other person and how they're feeling. And of course, this ends up not getting you heard either. Fawning feels you're being nice, but to the other person, it can feel uncomfortable, claustrophobia, something that's not really real. while it may have helped you survive childhood, it could be keeping you in relationships that are superficial. It could be something that someone can be friends with or fall in love with. It's a performance. It's putting a wall up. Another sign that you may have noticed is that group dynamics are overwhelming for you. That happens to people who weren't listened to as kids. You feel you get overlooked. You don't get your turn or you worry you're not going to get your turn. Or you feel everyone else is taking up all the space in the room and all the opportunities to say something and you get resentful. You feel pushed out. That's a horrible feeling too. And it's also one of those dynamics that can be made worse when you feel anxious and angry going into that group setting because you can end up seeming defensive or aggressive or not emotionally safe for other people to be around, huh. It's understandable that you got this way. You had to defend yourself and fight to exist, and you probably had to hide a lot of anger. But the thing is, when you're hiding anger, healthy people can sense it. Their nervous system is sensing your anger, but you're forcing a smile and saying everything's fine. And they'll perceive you as something's off, as untrustworthy. Something doesn't feel when you say one thing but feel, , give off a vibe of another. if you've been having a rough time being connected with people and you feel you've done such a great job of being cool and nice and agreeable, you may want to ask yourself if you're suppressing anger. Anger, both the negative and the negative. Anger is a very powerful thing. It's a very powerful thing.",

I feel awful. My stomach hurts. And I go into this big story, this big list of problems that I could be believed. And I was already believed.

When I'm dysregulated, I get clumsy and trip on curbs and drop things. My handwriting changes. For a lot of us, we say things we don't mean when we're dysregulating. We do things that we regret later. Almost as if we were half conscious in that moment. And we lacked the clear thinking to say no or do the thing. Or we may grow silent and withdrawn. Or we may feel desperate and act impulsively. Or fly into a rage and lash out. After that kind of outburst, we may feel almost no emotion. And then what would be worse, is what happens sometimes, is we behave coldly to the people we've just hurt. Our affect is flat. My friend told me that when I'm upset, I have a flat affect. That's a blank expression on my face. And it's impossible to tell from the outside what I'm feeling. I look I don't care. When somebody tells me something , Anna, Anna, something terrible has happened. I just go, oh. They think I don't care, but I do care. Maybe I care too much, in fact.

These reactions are not happening because I'm bad or anybody's bad or you're bad or selfish or weak. These reactions are happening or they're made worse because the brain is dysregulated. Nobody knew this before. Not doctors, not therapists. Nobody knew. But now we know. Now, for better and worse, people usually can't tell you're dysregulated by looking at you, which can be good because sometimes you just, that's just a private thing. You want to look you have it together. But on the other hand, when people can't see what's going on with you, you can end up getting into the habit of hiding how you really feel, where you're in this dance where people assume you're , you pretend you're.

I built a life where I never had to ask, where I never had to need anything, where I could do everything myself. But here's the thing. Trauma wounds don't just come from the disappointed feeling that you were neglected, the neglect itself can cause changes to your nervous system. In childhood development where you don't end up learning to naturally connect you were supposed to or you can't connect fully. And I've learned that it's incredibly common for traumatized people to feel a sense of disconnection from people in every part of their lives, in every kind of relationship. I didn't know that back then. I just knew that I felt separate from people. I could be in a room at a party, even with someone I loved and still feel completely disconnected. And then after my divorce and the death and all the surgery, when everything fell apart, I saw the full cost of what this life of disconnection was because you can kind of be independent when you physically can take care of yourself. But when you need people, you need people. And I didn't have anyone who would show up. And I realized I wasn't just unlucky with friends.

This was a whole journal that I had nine obstacles inside me that had been blocking connection my whole life. And these are common in people with trauma, and they're sneaky.

And they have an interesting analogy to the terms fight, flight, and freeze, because these are survival responses to threat. when somebody betrays you, and you are fully empowered, it actually is in your interest to either fight or flee, because you don't want to continue to be harmed by this person. you go to a store where you keep getting bad product, and you're getting ripped off. , either you demand the store give you your money back, which would be fight, or you decide not to shop there anymore, which would be flight. You can think about that with relationships, too. A friend betrays you in a certain way, and you are empowered to pick different friends. , you may leave that friend or give them an ultimatum. You either correct this behavior, or you either leave it or this relationship's over. However, that's great if you have that empowerment, but it's destabilizing, and you are risking the continuation of the relationship and your status. If you're not fully empowered, that can be very dangerous. a child doesn't have the option, really,. And when a child, say, fights against mistreatment, it's often going to escalate. It's going to escalate the mistreatment. And when a child tries to flee from mistreatment in a real-world sense, maybe hide in their room or stop talking to their parent or withdraw, they risk the person, their parent or whoever it is, not taking care of them and meeting their needs, because relationships require this active involvement. this is where that third path comes in that I call betrayal blindness, which is, the not seeing to some degree what's going on in order to stay engaged in a relationship that you feel and may truly be necessary to your survival. And it can keep a child or an adult alive. You see a similar dynamic in the workplace when somebody really needs a job, and they have a boss who's bullying them or sexually harassing them. If they confront that by complaining, or they withdraw, or they're not able to get out of the workplace, they're not able to get out of the job, they're not able to control themselves.",

They really need that job. in that case, people can also use betrayal blindness to keep the job by not seeing fully the mistreatment. You said here that if a person feels empowered, experience, what do you believe drives this sense of a person feeling sufficiently empowered to be able to address betrayal in a relationship. That's a great question. And a complication is sometimes people are actually empowered and they don't feel it. Sometimes people are not empowered, but they think they are. people are not empowered when there is a vast power difference between the two sides. If you're a small child, you're not empowered in your relationship with your parents in a kind of physical sense. They can just overpower you. In a really healthy parent-child relationship, the parent will try to provide a kind of power to the child that, for instance, the child can complain and the parent will listen. But it's a resource the parent's giving the child. Inherently, the situation there is very. asymmetric. The parent holds the power. , often in our society, we have that kind of asymmetry. it can show up, suppose a traffic violation, and uses all their social position, whether it's racial or their gun in their holster, to overpower the person that they've just stopped.

And they were saying, , the organization can't, we love gymnastics, we love the sport, this is the governing body, we have to believe in it. It's almost implicit that they do trust these kinds of organizations, whether they be church, church, church, church, church, church, church, church, church, church, or guild organizations, or even employers, or even institutions the justice system. Yes, absolutely. We see that. And, , to some extent, the organizations also foster this emotional reaction. the organizations will say, , we're your family, we're here for you, they will use the language of trust, independence and care that builds upon our impulse to trust these organizations. I see this as , as related to the trust we have in our families. We don't just have an individual we trust and love our earliest groups, our families, and we have a term family betrayal in my lab, which captures some, some of the ways that the group can betray people. And we find that it can be even sort of, in some sense, more powerful than individual one on one betrayal, which makes sense, because if a whole group is betrayed, then it's not just a group, it's a group of people. That's pretty scary. One thing you've wrote about in Blind to Betrayal, you talk about Leah Cosmody's work on the social contract, this idea in evolutionary psychology that we actually are, as human beings, quite good at detecting betrayal,. Which, which is interesting, because then that bangs up this idea of the social contract, that there is a trust that comes into our relationships with individuals or groups. Does that relate then into our inherent trust of big organizations. is that it's part of this trusting social contract that we have, that we have to trust this. What's really important in both Cosmutee's ideas and mine is that we continue to interact with the same people or organizations over and over.",

But that last piece, that last piece of reversing victim and offender, I think that still remains in that second part of gaslighting, which is to sort of undermine the, the, the person being abused. But I think it puts it in very stark focus because what it does is it plays on the empathy and the compassion and the equanimity of the person being abused. they'll say, Oh, wait a minute, maybe I am wrong.

But this framework, whether if it's a massive news story involving hundreds of people, or it's simply happening in somebody's interest, somebody's personal relationship, it takes gaslighting and it creates a much more holistic model of what happens in these relationships. I think it's also more specific. we've now got measurement instruments for Darvo experiences, being Darvo'd as Darvo use your tendency to use Darvo when you're accused of something.

    "text": "Meltdowns, mood swings, and the guilt that follows. Sound familiar. For many women, and really anyone who struggles with ADHD, emotional dysregulation is the struggle that no one talks about. This is ADHDand, where we talk about everyday life and ADHD. I'm your host, Dr. J. I'm a licensed psychologist who works with those with ADHD. Today, we're talking about ADHD and emotional dysregulation. When your brain struggles to filter distractions, it also struggles to filter feelings, making little things feel very big and not in the cute Tom Hanks dancing on a piano rug kind of way. ADHD is a disorder in many ways of self-regulation, and that includes not just attention and behavior, but also emotions. The parts of the brain responsible for managing executive function, the prefrontal cortex, are also key in regulating emotions. If your brain is a team, ADHD means that the manager is conveniently unavailable when everything goes sideways. For women, the stakes are different. Society doesn't just tell us to behave, it tells us to perform emotional control 24-7. Be calm, be pleasant, be agreeable. Meanwhile, internally, your nervous system is on the rollercoaster of doom. Listen, as a Black woman walking around in the world, I understand. Let's be real. Emotionality in women is policed it's a national security threat. The number of times I've caught a stray simply because I raised my hand and said I have an opinion, , at least it's my lived experience and my proof of this. We get labeled too sensitive when we react, irrational when we express anger, hysterical when we cry, and unstable when we experience movement. If a man slams a door, he's passionate. If a woman with ADHD cries because she's overstimulated, she's considered to be unstable. Do you see the double standard. And we're called quote-unquote crazy when we call out any of the above. To be clear, men have their own struggles that shouldn't be discounted. But this struggle that I'm mentioning is specific to certain marginalized identities. With women, nearly every emotion can be skewed as a result of their emotional experience. I have a female friend who was bullied because she was quote-unquote too cheerful. Men primarily get backlash when they show emotions that are deemed feminine. if they're emotionally vulnerable, they receive rejection, which sucks because seriously, we're rejecting someone because they're having a full emotional experience.",

It's time that we stop gaslighting women and really anyone of any gender out of their own nervous systems and start recognizing that emotional dysregulation and ADHD isn't a character flaw. It's a neurological trait that deserves support, compassion, and a heck of a lot more awareness. And outside of having a neurological, psychological, or physical health condition, under certain circumstances , I don't know, war and economic instability, it totally fits the facts that have been said about women. But the truth is, it's not always the case. And I think that's where we're going to have to start looking at the world of the future. the next time that someone says you're too sensitive, you tell them, no, I'm emotionally allergic to BS. Mind your business and have a blessed day. Is that just the chaos demon coming out of me. Probably. Don't start any unnecessary conflicts. I just know that I was born and raised in the deep south, and sometimes I feel people should pay more attention to their side of the street.

At least visit with the intention of being kind. However, the point remains that having emotions, even big ones, isn't inherently bad. We can learn how to express and cope with big emotions in an appropriate manner. And when mistakes happen, we can also learn how to repair with others. Let's go deeper into some of the connections between emotional dysregulation and ADHD. Number one is impairments in executive functioning. Emotion regulation requires a set of cognitive processes known as executive functions. This includes working memory, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility, which are consistently impaired in ADHD. Working memory allows people to hold emotional experiences in mind and reflect on them rather than reacting impulsively.",

    "text": "Inhibitory control helps to suppress immediate emotional reactions in favor of more appropriate responses. Cognitive flexibility enables individuals to reframe situations and shift emotional responses. When these functions are compromised, as they often are in ADHD, people struggle to pause, reflect, or adapt to emotional experiences effectively. Number two is heightened emotional reactivity. People with ADHD often experience more intense emotional responses to stimuli. This is true for both positive or negative experiences. This is partly due to differences in neural sensitivity in areas such as the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, which are central to emotional arousal and regulation. These folks may overreact to mild criticism, struggle to let go of frustrations, and feel emotions more quickly and more intensely than neurotypical individuals. This heightened reactivity coupled with impulsivity creates a recipe for emotional outbursts, mood swings, and interpersonal conflict. Number three is low frustration tolerance and rejection sensitivity. Many individuals with ADHD exhibit low frustration tolerance, meaning they struggle with delays, mistakes, or perceived failures. This intolerance can lead to meltdowns or emotional shutdowns, particularly in challenging environments school or work. Additionally, rejection-sensitive dysphoria, or RSD, is a term used to describe the extreme emotional sensitivity to perceived emotions. This is a term used to describe the extreme emotional sensitivity to perceived emotions. or rejection that is found in many with ADHD to be clear this is not an official clinical test. To be clear, this is not an official clinical term or diagnosis. What we are calling rejection sensitivity is common in basically all humans, but it is certainly heightened and those that struggle with ADHD and other mental health issues depression and anxiety. but it is certainly heightened and those that struggle with ADHD and other mental health issues depression and anxiety. Number four is deficits and self-awareness. I'm about to reveal a VERY clinical term. Number four is deficits and self-awareness. Some individuals with ADHD struggle with something called adaptive early-night Catastrophes of HÃple's pantry system to find prisoner effects. alexithymia or difficulty identifying and describing their own emotions. Without accurate awareness of what you're feeling, what happens is you're not able to regulate those feelings effectively. Research shows that adults with ADHD report more alexithymia traits compared to neurotypical controls. This can contribute to interpersonal difficulties and a greater risk of anxiety or depression.

    "text": "Now let's talk about strategies for identifying emotions and managing emotions. Number one is name it to tame it. This refers to emotional labeling. Putting words to your feelings activates the prefrontal cortex, which helps to downregulate the amygdala. let's talk about how do you do that. What you want to do is use a simple emotion word list or even a feelings wheel to help you identify a label that matches your experience. You really want to go beyond, mad, sad, or fine, and look for nuanced descriptions. , for example, disappointed versus despondent or annoyed versus enraged. You notice how when Banner goes into the Hulk, he goes from this thoughtful, dynamic scientist to basically Hulk smash. , when you don't have words for your experience, that's essentially you. Research shows that simply by labeling your emotions, it reduces the emotional intensity. This isn't just a word. It's a whole lot of information. It's a whole lot of information. It's not something that comes natural to many. you have to practice, and there's really no shame in that. The second suggestion for identifying emotions is to use body cues as emotional clues. People with ADHD or alexithymia often struggle to think their feelings, but the body typically gives hints. let's talk about how to do it. What you want to do is ask yourself, what's happening in my body now. Is my jaw clenched. Are my shoulders tense. Did my ears turn red. Practice body scans to bring awareness to physical sensations before labeling the emotion. For example, if my neck is hot and my nostrils are flared, I am angry. If I have a flutter in my stomach and my mouth is dry, it means that I'm nervous. Let me tell you a little bit about why this works. Emotions are somatic. They show up as an increased heart rate, shallow breathing or tension in the body, etc. This can be a backdoor into emotional awareness. Now let's switch to managing emotions. This is straight from DBT's distress tolerance, and it's called the TIP skill. TIP is a DBT acronym for fast acting physiological regulation, ideal for moments of emotional flooding. The T stands for temperature. Temperature is a great way for bringing down emotionality quickly.",

This works because we're mammals and we have a mammalian diving complex. anytime we dive into deep cold water, our body automatically brings down our heart rate and respiration rate. Guess what's shooting through the roof when you're emotionally dysregulated. Both of those things. for people, this action lowers blood pressure drastically and rapidly. if you have any heart conditions, you may want to speak with a medical professional before trying this. The I is for intense exercise. This could be 20 jumping jacks, a brisk walk or running up a few flights of stairs. It all works. I had a patient who struggled with anger, and one of the strategies that we used is that they would walk briskly up the six flights of stairs in their building, and this typically took the edge off of any intense anger that they felt after using the strategy. They had enough space to utilize other strategies to work through their feelings based on the catalyst for their anger. In that moment, the first P and yes, there's two of them. And tip is paced breathing. this is where you basically breathe out longer than you breathe in. There's lots of strategies for this. I personally use straw breathing on a regular basis. This is basically where you breathe in, fill up your lungs, purse your lips and blow out you're blowing through a straw. I find it really helpful and soothing for my nervous system. The second P is for progressive muscle relaxation or PMR. This is essentially where you tense and release various muscle groups to help regulate your emotions. You can find a lot of breathing and PMR meditations online. If you've been navigating the emotional rollercoaster of ADHD, feeling things deeply, reacting before you mean to, or struggling to explain what's happening inside of you, you're not alone in this. And your emotions, no matter how intense, are not a flaw, they're signals asking for care, understanding and support. Listen to the signal. Be curious about it.

wrote the mind body connection something that he treated the pain with a lot of pain and he said howard stern all these movie stars back in the day at first it was just all backaches and what his number one cause of backaches are what hey chronic anger interesting yes interesting he swears he's a psychoanalytic guy and he gives all these examples and talks about anxiety about every physical manifestation is caused by the fact that the person who is by this chronic there's a word he has for it but it's basically chronic tension holding chronic tension all different areas of your body and anger is the biggest culprit it's interesting I mean we look at activation nervous system activation when we feel threatened yes we can fight flight or freeze now a lot of times when we talk about

came from pickleball and someone else came to the gym and is church-sick and I'm oh my god I'm gonna go to church gym and they had it reserved to play soccer and I wanted to play soccer with him and I asked him I joined you guys whatever long story short long story short I was reminded of when I played soccer in college and it was intramural and stuff it was casual soccer recreational soccer and people said Emma you were kind of scary because you were competitive I would kick the ball too hard and I'd hurt people not hurt people one lady she got a red mark on her leg because I kicked the ball too hard and another time I was playing intramural flag football and my friend was you're getting kind of competitive Emma you get a little too little too intense and it's a little scary and I'm then I go back to this repressed place I'm a nice therapist is always peaceful I would say that's a little scary to think of myself as being competitive let's go and I wanted to play soccer with them and as I was driving home I was thinking man I just missed that feeling of being able to be as intense as I can be yes two things one is it sounds it's a great place for you to express that aggressiveness and no I being aggressive I actually enjoy that in soccer but I'm absolutely not aggressive in my relationships except for sometimes when I'm really passive aggressive we didn't get to that one that's what I was gonna it's funny the saying how do you're around a passive aggressive person everybody around them is angry no and growing up I was taught you don't inconvenience people you don't say what you really think because it might hurt their feelings and I think I'm afraid of hurting other people yes and it's great though because on one hand you're saying the sports and the competitiveness was a way you could get that out but on the other hand I wonder that's the safe place to get it out but what's really going on behind all that where did where is the wound yes wound what and I would say as the you're saying to me there's a fear of hurting people's feelings the question is when did you first have the fear what happened first thing let's see I can think of probably I was 13 my sister said you're selfish oh you're such a selfish person and then I remember pouting for a long time was your coping skill we're trying to get attention trying to get her to say sorry or something you're trying to get a need met that you can't get met in another way I would say it started earlier in the 13 I would just guess I mean I remember being very angry at my parents during those middle school years I hated my parents but I never told them that no but what are you angry about if you back it up even earlier Emma oh baby let's go because the fear of what other people think I bet starts way earlier you think about elementary school when did you start did something happen in a class did it happen with a sibling I mean the selfishness thing is definitely a message it's oh I can't be selfish just even wanting what I want is selfish that's big but usually it's earlier I mean I don't I don't remember I don't have any memories I think my mom was someone you did not disagree with you don't disagree with her either you're wrong or you're being mean if you disagree I was not allowed to express opinions without being I mean yes and no she's a good person now we have a good relationship now I'm sure you do look what you just said you said you said oh I have this fear of other people's opinions and later you're I guess I couldn't express figure to my mom because I would never be what would be the consequence of that a kid feeling completely powerlessness lectures just lectured and the only response to that is anger because there's no place in between it's I could feel sad about it I could get anxious but really it sounds it's powerlessness and anger and that could have been part of what was happening I mean the thing that I talk about a lot is the whole fear thing and we could say slash anxiety I mean supposedly there's only two fears we're born with the fear of loud noises and the fear of falling are the physiological fears to me we don't pop out of the womb with fears of rejection versus abandonment fears of not being liked not being loved all these things happen and then this wound happens and then we behave out of those temptations you're saying geez I couldn't even express my opinion to my mother because I was always wrong how did I what did I become I became someone who was always accommodating and acquiescing or I became someone that maybe just felt angry and needed to get it out either possible it's true it's true and it's there wasn't there wasn't space to disagree there wasn't space to have conversations it was just you're probably wrong you get lectured and I couldn't say that to them in my teenage years I couldn't be I don't how you're doing this that would have just never gone over that would but I don't know but you probably felt it a lot more when you got to be a teenager that's you're in the hatred you couldn't repress it when we're little it seems that's easier to do but we put on hormones and we're getting bigger and blah blah now it's going to start coming out and what's fascinating and I know I'm not your therapist but what's fascinating to me now is that you're saying this thing and then we think about the last video we did when you're talking about your mother a lot getting really mad at her because of her dismissiveness and then I think of course because your training and your anger goes way back when you think about it someone dismissing someone saying oh I'm not and taking over and that was the exact same dynamic really when you think about it no it's true and I could I can definitely see my resentment shows up more with my mother-in-law now than with anyone else really but I don't I also have to interact with her at least that are more other I can't avoid I can't just avoid that relationship whereas if anyone else bugs me I can just avoid them basically and my mom is funny with adult kids she's completely heads off she doesn't give advice not hands off she loves being involved in her life sitting up and playing with her grandkids but she doesn't give advice and she doesn't tell us what to do and she doesn't she treats her adult kids very much just lets them make their own choices and have their own path which is which is why I think now when my mother-in-law comes in and tells me what to do I get a little bit huffy that old activation yes good point yes old activation let's say it's old activation what do I do now if it's I really couldn't say what I wanted to say what I wanted to say I'm feeling just what did her mom do last night I was going to say hey 찬έ trainees colaborating or taking external roles of what they looked the older I get older hairs go in pretty bad but that's good to enter I thinkesp an aftertaste but I guess at least I would say the parents are made up when you look at us it's not on the inside that they had need a break and they would have done wolfy is going to do a very funny one move he and daughter talk and go nothing the constant spicesии not to be mailed, but you write an anger letter.",

And really what I saw is I had this fear from very young about not feeling loved because of my mom was unavailable. And I think what happens is when you recognize the earlier fear that's connected to your present resentment, you have this, this is what happened to me. It opens up this awareness of my gosh, I'm literally operating in the present and projecting on all my relationships, a fear that has nothing to do with Tom, my boyfriend. what I'm saying. you get some spaciousness around the, the anger and it helps to kind of alleviate some of the energy around it where you get, I do think awareness acceptance, , kind of getting some spaciousness. Anger can feel really big. And that's why it's important to look at what is getting activated. getting the awareness, obviously writing can help, but you're actually absolutely. I don't feel you, it's not about getting angry at the people in your life because that is not appropriate. Feeling anger is. Expressing anger in writing or exercise or soccer or, , calling your best friend and venting, or, , what screaming in your car is a good one, , when you're driving and you're just , you've had it and you're screaming. , yes, definitely getting out the physiological piece is great. But to me, what really reduces and kind of, you get the, , is when you get to the underlying fear and then the, the sadness, because really what was, what was there for me is the wound that I didn't feel loved. What do you do with the wound then. Is this something where you're , , at least now that I've named it and I'm clear about it, it's not going to fuel all this false, superficial anger. That's at least we're going to get rid of all that. , the suffering,.

And I'm sure you talk about this on your channel all the time is owning the emotion, letting it through and not letting it get stuck and watching the cognitions because it's not really the emotion.

    "text": ", have you ever felt your emotions are on a roller coaster that you can't control. That is emotional dysregulation. when your feelings seem to have a mind of their own. And today we're getting real about this, really misunderstood experience with an article from our very own Sandstone Care. Emotional dysregulation, 11 types, causes, and best treatments. And it's a lot, Deb, but it's relevant. It really is, Clint. And it's packed with insights. , the first thing that stood out to me was how they define emotional dysregulation. it's not just being emotional,. It's about struggling to control those emotional responses. , and that struggle can look many things, which is why they break it down into three core types of emotion regulation. You've got your attentional control, cognitive reappraisal, and response modulation. And those aren't just psych jargon. This is really useful stuff. stick with us. , unpack that a little bit for me. What do those even really mean. basically, attentional control is about focus. Can you shift your attention away from something upsetting. And then cognitive reappraisal is how you interpret a situation. , is it a catastrophe or just a Tuesday. And response modulation, that's about the intensity of your reaction. , a measured response or a total meltdown. , there are examples someone cuts you off in traffic. Attentional control is if you can stay focused on driving safely, instead of getting totally consumed with anger. And cognitive reappraisal is, , maybe they're having a worse day than me, not really assuming that they're out to just ruin your day. Exactly. In response modulation. That's the difference between a quick honk in the horn. And tailgating them for the next five miles,. And these skills or, , a little bit of a jerk, but they're not going to hurt you. , , that's a good thing. They impact every single part of your life, your job, your relationships, even just how you feel about yourself on a daily basis. it's the foundation for being a functional human, basically, which actually brings us to something I know is pretty relevant for you. ADHD,. this article emphasizes that people with ADHD often experience emotions more intensely, which can make regulation actually pretty tough. , it's really explained in the article. , how most people find it annoying when they spill their coffee.",

    "text": "And this is where the article emphasizes all the different ways emotional dysregulation can manifest. And it is important. Because it's not always as obvious as someone having a meltdown, is it. We tend to focus on those outward bursts. But for some people, emotional dysregulation might look complete withdrawal or isolation. Even shutting down completely. And it is easy to misinterpret that, especially if you're looking for the more obvious signs. Absolutely. Someone might seem they're just being quiet when actually they're battling this hurricane of emotions and they just don't know how to express it. Which is why this whole article has really been such an eye opener for me, because it's not about just slapping a label on anyone. It's about actually understanding that emotional dysregulation exists on a spectrum. And whether you can relate to it personally or you're seeing it in someone that you love, this resource gives you a starting point. It really does. And it highlights how important it is to approach these situations with empathy, not judgment. Because telling someone to just get over it is about as helpful as selling a fish to climb a tree. Also, do you talk to fishes. Very often. , this conversation, it has sparked a lot of my own curiosity. And if it sparked yours, definitely check out the full article on Sandstone Care's website under treatment resources, because really we've only scratched the surface, but hopefully it's given you a new perspective on emotional dysregulation. And maybe even some actionable takeaways to help yourself or someone that you care about, because knowledge is power,. And sometimes a little bit of understanding can go a long way. See you guys next time.",

    "text": "hey there everybody and welcome to happiness isn't brain surgery with doc snipes practical tools to improve your mood and quality of life today we're going to be talking about two sort of related concepts validation or our need for validation and control and let's start with validation what is this validation is when we get the message that we're we need validation to feel good about ourselves but we don't necessarily need validation from every person and that's one of the places that a lot of us make mistakes is that we want to be loved and approved of by everybody all the time get over it ain't going to happen you're not even going to approve of yourself all the time but one of the steps or one of the things that you can do in order to ensure that you're getting the validation that you need is to a make sure that you self validate you look at yourself and you say i'm i'm a good person i make mistakes i'm not perfect but i'm a good person and also surround yourself with significant others who validate you they may not say it and remember when we talk about love languages sometimes people communicate their validation and caring not necessarily by words but by acts of service or by giving gifts or spending quality time with you if they want to spend time with you that's validating it means they enjoy being around you we do need to be a little bit more open to the concept of validation we also need to know how we experience how we prefer to experience validation because even though people are not necessarily by their nature going to communicate that way we can nudge them in that direction we can let them know how we experience love what our love languages are and that will help them be able to more effectively validate us for me for example one of my top love languages is acts of service when people do nice things when my kids i come home and they've done an extra good job cleaning the house i'm just i'm just i'm just oh my gosh thank you much that is very validating to me it validates that they respect me and they care about me as a person i'm not big on gifts that's not one of those things you need to know how you experience validation and be able to communicate that to others they can communicate to you in your love language otherwise if you're speaking two different languages you're probably going to have an impasse we also need to look at from whom we need validation and why and this is a big question we need validation from other people it's true we need to feel we're loved and we're accepted by people but not everybody i want you to think about who in your life you need validation from is it your kids is it your significant other is it your parents who is it and why what would happen just hypothetically what would happen if one of those people that you quote need validation from didn't give it to you does it make you less of a person does it make you less as a person sometimes i'll take parents for example sometimes parents aren't going to agree with the decisions their kids make and they're not going to validate those decisions but we want to separate number one we want to separate them not validating decisions from not validating us if i make a decision that my parents didn't agree with or when i did they were very clear they didn't agree with that decision but they loved me and they supported me anyway which was validating they may not agree with the choice i was making they may think it was downright a mistake but they loved me and supported me anyway you want to separate validation of actions from validation of the decision that you made and of person for one and number two remember that not everybody is going to be able to for one reason or another validate you all the time you need to be able to validate yourself if they don't agree with it or if they're not providing the attention and quality time and validation that you need all where can you get it from don't put all your eggs in one basket rely on other people know that you've got other friends that are there to support you even if one friend is kind of flaking out now do we need validation from our higher power and if you're a spiritual person you may you may want to believe that your higher power approves of you again you need that's a relationship that nobody else is taking part in you need to be able to have a good communication with that higher power or a feeling in your head heart and gut that says i am doing by my higher power and i'm making my higher power proud of me if that is a validation that you need and we do need validation from ourselves in order to get love respect validation from other people we have to be able to love respect and validate ourselves you need to look in the mirror and go I'm a good person practice that when you start criticizing yourself and a lot of us get caught up with these self-deprecating comments about i'm stupid i'm not good at that i'm whatever knock that off that's maybe you made a mistake that's but you're still a good person and be able to appreciate yourself for who you are then you're not going to need other people to always validate you because if they're not able to do it because they're caught up with their own stuff or they just are mad at you for some reason or whatever that's that's their you don't have to have them to tell you that it's that you breathe the air you need to be able to validate yourself what does validation look we keep talking about this word but what is it you can have your feelings validated and for a lot of us who are feelers if you go to the myers-briggs we need to have when we feel upset or something we need to have we need to have your feelings and they're about to come to the way they have to have your feelings in place if you have to have them in place that is that's our feelings validated we need to have somebody say i can see that you're really angry or i can see that you're really scared they may not agree they don't have to feel the same but if they're identifying how we feel and they're going i got you i'm sensing that you feel this way that can be enough now do they have to agree with our feelings if we say yes then we're going to set ourselves up for a world to hurt because we can't control how other people feel we need to accept that we feel how we feel based on our experiences my experiences are very different than my friends experiences where something might stress me out it may not stress her out and there are some things that stress her out that don't bother me a bit and i understand for example she is terrible fight of paper wasps and i love the little buggers they're they're great beneficial insects they're really docile but i can understand her fear of them and i validate the fact that she's afraid of them and i respect that i don't say oh poo just get over it's not that easy i wish she could see how cute they were but that's not how she's wired i'm not saying that she's afraid of them but i'm saying that she's afraid of them and i'm not saying that she's afraid of them and i'm not saying that she's afraid of them and i'm not a little bit terrified of them and i'm not saying that she's afraid of them and i'm not i recognize that is a part of her and i validate that we want to validate people's thoughts and they're going to have different opinions my son has different opinions about things than i do and i have different opinions than my mother and etc and that's we want to validate their thoughts as their thoughts are valid your thoughts your opinions your feelings are valid for you they may not be valid for me but they are valid for you're not forcing them to be what they're supposed to be but at some point that's you're not forcing and i respect you as a person and we need to have our being validated we need to be validated that we are lovable good people and that is independent of what we do and our feelings and our thoughts it's who we are we are good people that make mistakes that are fallible that yada yada but we need to believe that we are lovable and we need to feel experience that other people believe that we are lovable and again it doesn't necessarily come from the people that every person that we want it to not everybody is going to validate your being and that's a lot a lot of times that has more to do with their stuff than your stuff but if you let it destroy your self-esteem and your confidence and your mood and your energy then you're giving them power validate yourself say what i'm good enough i'm smart enough and gosh darn it people me and move on and recognize all the other people in your life that validate who you are that person is just missing the boat and then tough diddlywinks for them and that's what we're doing and that's what we're doing and that's what we're doing what are some reasons we may not get validation from other people they may not agree or feel the same and they may be unwilling or unable to take our point of view some people have huge control issues it's either their way or the highway now remember i keep saying if they can't validate you it's probably more about them than about you this is a perfect example if they are unwilling to respect your point of view or your feelings that's more about them if they're too immersed in their own stuff to be able to begin to understand your point of view whether it's whatever drama they've got going on in their life and they just don't have the emotional energy to pay attention to what's going on to you or to listen or to be there for you it doesn't mean it's about you it means it's their stuff is getting in the way always take a step back and ask yourself is there some other reason besides me besides me being unvalidatable that this person may be acting this way and 99 of the time you're going to come up with a great big yes now why might we not get validation from ourselves it's really hard to validate ourselves if we base our entire worth on what other people say do and think about us if i feel i'm a worthwhile person long as and me and as long as i'm in a relationship and as long as this and that and the other all of those things are involve other people and i can't control other people if those other people are caught in their own stuff which a lot of us are these days then i may be out there kind of flapping a fish out of water if i can validate myself then i can catch my breath we can't validate ourselves if we don't appreciate ourselves and that whole self-love thing people kind of laugh at it and they're oh that's hokey but really you need to realize and call it whatever you want self-respect self-love self-honesty you need to look inside and go i'm a good person because and one of the ways that i have clients do this sometimes is go online and find a list of values and if you put in the top 100 values or something you can get all kinds of values lists and it'll say things honesty and integrity and compassion and yada and go through that list and highlight all of the values that represent you and then go back over that list and highlight the top five that really characterize who you are that you're not different and really define who you are and how you feel about yourself and how that is real.",

    "text": "Thinking more about codependency as an addiction, we look at, , in addictions, we have continued use of the person or activity to cope with distress despite negative consequences. And we see this in codependent relationships. But how might this emerge from insecure attachment. The person who is insecurely attached and in this case, we're talking about anxious attachment is terrified of abandonment. They feel ill-equipped to handle life. They feel unlovable for who they are that they feel they need to continue to be in that relationship because that relationship gives them breath. It gives them life. Even if that relationship causes problems, at least it allows them to, to exist. And this can get really challenging in codependent relationships because the relationship may be destructive that the person with codependency may actually, their persona may actually really stop existing, but they are terrified of being alone that they continue. There's a persistent desire to cut down or control codependent behaviors. Controlling the desire to control is really difficult. And the person with codependency may want to stop trying to micromanage and control the person they're in a relationship or the people they're in relationships with. But they have difficulty doing it because as soon as they stop trying to control other people, they're going to be in a relationship with them. And they're going to be in a relationship with them. And they're going to be in a relationship with them. And they're going to be in a relationship with them. And they're going to be in a relationship with them. They feel they are terribly out of control themselves. Think back to insecure attachment. If a child's growing up and they have no guidance or they have extremely harsh guidance and they can't do anything , they feel their world is out of control. Now they've finally gotten to a place where they feel they've got control of something. And it's , , maybe I can breathe for a minute, but is this. Is this the healthiest place to be. children who don't have a secure attachment feel out of control. They feel overwhelmed by their emotions. They feel overwhelmed by life because they don't have anybody guiding them, helping them develop the tools to handle life on life's terms.",

    "text": "What does recovery look. For people who are codependent, is to recognize that they probably are doing this out of a place of fear and terror. And we need to understand where that's coming from. But these experiences that caused that, the injuries from others, often resulted from other people's need to take care of themselves, not a desire to hurt them. Their parents didn't have a desire to hurt them or their caregivers. Their caregivers were unable to cope with life on life's terms. And as a result, the child did not get their needs met. They need to recognize their current behaviors as a creative way of surviving unmanageable pain and distress. Think about children. When they get upset, they may feel overwhelmed by their emotions. And in a healthy relationship, the caregiver will pull the child aside, and help them breathe. Breathe with mommy for a minute, and let's talk about what's going on. Or let's go on a walk for a minute, you can calm down. And then we'll talk about what's going on. In a dysfunctional relationship, the caregiver can't be counted on to do that. the child doesn't have good models for how to handle distress. They don't have somebody there to help them deal with all of these experiences that they've never had before and have no idea how to cope with. And the person needs to identify the functions of their particular codependent behaviors and alternate ways to meet those needs. let's look at some of those behaviors that might come up. People with addictions, as to chemicals, to other activities, as people with codependency, often have a lot of these traits in common. Low self-esteem is a big one. The low self-esteem can appear as worthlessness. And this is what we typically interpret as low self-esteem. A person doesn't feel good about themselves, they try to make themselves lovable through what they do. And they rely on other people for external validation because they can't look in the mirror and say, I'm of value. that is our traditional view of low self-esteem.

I mean, as caregivers, we've had many more years on this earth than our five-year-old. we may not see what they're getting upset about as a big deal or agree with their perspective, but we validate how they're feeling. We help them identify that emotion. You're feeling angry now. And from there, we can start talking about it.

    "text": "But even if they're not, they do, even if they do know what they're experiencing, many times they're too afraid to even say it for fear of rejection. People with addictions often spend many years numbing their feelings because they don't know how to identify them or regulate them that they have this same problem where they don't even know what they feel anymore, what they want, because they've been out of touch with themselves for long. Difficulty identifying and guilt about meeting their adult wants and needs is another characteristic, especially prominent in people with codependency because when you've got low self-esteem, a lot of times you don't feel you're worthy of love and taking care of your needs is an act of love. And if you don't feel you're a worthwhile person, then you may feel guilty taking time out to take care of yourself, especially taking care of needs beyond the basic food, shelter, that sort of thing. A lot of people who are in codependent relationships forego sleep and other things in order to focus on, maintain, manipulate the relationship and they feel guilty if they are taking time out for themselves. They don't feel they deserve it. People in codependent relationships often experience emotional dysregulation because they were never taught how to regulate their emotions, for one. From jump, they weren't taught to identify their emotion and how to deal with it. But when people are exposed to chronic stress and trauma, there are brain changes, actual structural changes in the brain. This is the wiring, if you will, that promotes emotional dysregulation. It promotes hypervigilance. I'm going to be hyper aware of what's going on, constantly scanning for threats. , that's exhausting. And the person who is constantly scanning for threats may see those and may feel overwhelmed. When they're constantly scanning for threats, when they're constantly dealing with the stressful things they see, it is keeping their fight or flight system hyperactivated. At a certain point, the body itself and the brain changes structure and the body itself starts shutting down the fight or flight system and says, we can't be this hyped up, this stressed out, this hypervigilant for this long. , we're not going to trigger that response unless something major happens.",

But then when something does happen, they have a tsunami of neurotransmitters that are secreted and they react in a strong way. , you have people who are hypervigilant, highly sensitive, constantly perceiving threats in their environment and there's changes in the brain that actually promote or cause the neurochemical reaction that we see as emotional dysregulation. Can it be fixed. Fixed. To a large part, yes. As the person starts learning to identify their triggers and regulate their emotions and starts to feel safe and they're not hypervigilant anymore, that HPA axis will retune. People with codependency often experience a lot of depression, anxiety, anger, and resentment. , anger, anxiety, and resentment are all part of that fight or flight response. And when they start feeling hopeless to change it, when they start feeling I can't be anxious this anymore, I'm exhausted, then they may move into this place where they feel helpless, hopeless, and depressed. We already talked about hypervigilance. Now, interestingly, people who are codependent and people who have addictions often lack empathy for the feelings and needs of others. Why is that. , in codependency, as in some people who end up developing chemical addictions, they didn't learn the skill of empathy. They didn't have anybody saying, , what do you think Johnny felt when that happened. Empathy is a learned skill. We have a little bit of it, but in order to really become fully empathetic, we need to hone that skill and practice it. But aside from that, the person with codependency or addiction is often overwhelmed by life and all the crap going on and the terror of being abandoned or the terror of the pain returning, that they don't have any energy left to empathize with anybody else. Let's just face it. They are trying to keep their head above water, and it's not that they don't want to empathize with others or they don't care about others, but they are completely paralyzed and overwhelmed with their own stuff that they just don't have it in them. They don't have a breath to focus on it. People with codependency often need to be in control, and we've talked about that.",

They assume since they want it, other people must want it too. They may become resentful when their help is rejected and use blame and shame to control. Resentment is a form of anger. Anger is a reaction to threat. When their help is rejected, they start feeling scared. They start feeling threatened and probably of abandonment. They drop back and punt. They get angry. They start using blame and shame to try to pull the person back in into line they won't abandon them. On the other hand, they may lavish gifts, favors, or sexual attention on those they want to influence. They may do whatever. This is the Fawn that we talked about.

It's important to identify the functions of each of the person's behaviors and the alternatives. What is motivating you to act this way. Whatever the behavior is. What function does it serve.

It's important that people recognize that they are powerless ultimately over another person. How are they going to deal with that. Because that thought is terrifying. Recognizing that they may be powerless over some overwhelming feelings that they have been hiding from or trying to shield them from.

Next is sense of self. Perception of yourself as a person. Doubting your emotions and your reactions, maybe despite being about yourself or people or situation.

Second, to rebuild a sense of self, we're going to write a truth statement. This is how we fight the abuse of perception head-on in context of two things. One is reclaiming your sense of self through real perception and the other is dismantling who your narcissistic parent said you were. This is done in two parts. The first part is write out your narcissistic parents narrative about who you are on a piece of paper, the narcissistic parents narrative about that Christmas example. The second part is to write out your truth statement about your sense of self. I had the to let everyone at Christmas know that you got a C in math and you don't deserve presents because you made me look foolish. Two, on the back of that paper, write out your truth statement about your sense of self and don't forget to dismantle the narcissistic parents narrative in the first part.

They start to do some work with a therapist. They gain some insight. The upset from the beginning stressor dies down from the emission. The initial mess kind of dies down and they're feeling better. Therapy can be that. It can be a place to get support in a crisis, but if you wanna work on childhood trauma and really do some deeper work, deeper changing, it takes a while. It's got a lot of ups and downs. You'll get sick of rehashing. Even when you're with a really good therapist doing good work, you're gonna feel a lot of deep, messy things. it's understandable to wanna feel better, but just with number one, you're gonna feel better. And number two, you're gonna feel better, but you're gonna feel better. And number three, you're gonna feel better. the client's gonna feel better, but the awareness doesn't change us. the client does a pause in their therapy and they sort of go, eh, maybe later for that bigger stuff down the road. This was good for me for now. But the patterns they experience don't change. And while they might feel better in the moment, a breakup down the road might tank them again, or another abusive family situation might come up again. There's always the next family holiday, and that's when they're gonna feel better.",

I was sort of doing it into the third and fourth grade when it's recommended that the cutoff of that stuff is usually around five or six. I feel actually grateful for having sort of the blankie and all that, kind of going on, given what was going on around me in my childhood. But it would also bring a lot of negative attention from people that felt very shaming, why is he still doing that when he's in the third and fourth grade. It wasn't, it was a red flag to other people, but not within the family. when children are neglected and grow up in abuse, the need for external security is greater, which is beneficial since they're not getting any help from the adults. However, as we grow into adulthood, we can get stuck in living from an insecure place, and this is what they're doing. I think it's a good idea to have that kind of a blankie, and I think it's a good idea to have that kind of a blankie, and I think it's a good idea to have that kind of a blankie, that looks. We can be really resistant to change, fear of the unknown as a security issue. We can get into some big procrastination problems, which is fear of maybe criticism or failure, can be more complex than that at times. We can have a lot of social anxiety or go into social situations and feel anxious without an anchor, a safe person with us at the work party or the work event. We can actually have some controlling behaviors, getting to places on time can be a security issue.

    "text": "Cognitive stuff only takes us really far when we need a deeper processing of our childhood-stuck emotions and situations and relationships with abusive parents. Functioning delays are essentially the evidence of parental neglect, misbehavior, and misbehavior. we need to be able to understand what's going on in our childhood and not to be confused with things learning problems or neurodivergence. many childhood trauma survivors, including myself, often had to hide that they struggle with basic learning skills due to a lack of consistent care from a parent who is supposed to be helping them have some mastery over some basic skills. Some examples. I've had several clients, actually several of them, tell me that still in their 30s or 40s, they still need to hold out their hands this to decide which ones to let go. And I've had a lot of clients who have had to let go of their hands and decide which ones to let go. And I've had a lot of clients who have had to let go of their hands and say, which one's the left one, which one's the one, because they had to come up with that on their own. Or somebody helped them at school with that. And it's the habit has stuck. And I've also had clients tell me that they assume that they can get through their day with only one or three hours of sleep from staying up late or believing that two hours of work can maybe happen in 20 minutes. some magical thinking there around functioning. Here are some other specific examples related to functioning delays and neglect. Fear of how your handwriting looks You might get anxious writing out a check or signing something for fear of doing it wrong. That kind of makes me wonder about neglect. Hiding that you still don't quite understand how something works, such as making a doctor's appointment or how a deductible works. Maybe that's a bad example because I still struggle with understanding how a health insurance deductible works. Another is not knowing how to bring something up in conversation to knowing how filing taxes work. Not taking in that the check engine light is coming on or that you should maybe be concerned about that. And again, this is not criticism. These are sort of things that come with neglect.",

And again, a teenager might ignore a check engine light out of just being a teen, not knowing what that means. Hopefully not, but the functioning issues are not all black and white and only related to neglect. However, while these can be seen as, say, human mistakes, there can also be a childhood trauma story underneath them, such as being raised by a very limited parent, say, someone struggling with mental illness or a hoarder who had their own functioning problems. I find that those raised in that can be over-functioning, which is another problem of the functioning delay. The functioning delay in context is a combination of neglect and the child's tendency to think in terms of magical thinking or being wrapped up in fear. They never really had a parent to help them with basics in the day-to-day parenting work of helping them with homework or preparing something or getting a child's resources, getting them resources , say, a school tutor or helping them learn how to even wash their hands. , it's a combination of neglect and the child's tendency to think in terms of their hair with shampoo. I've had many clients actually show their neglect when they would come into my office not dressed for the weather. , they might come in with flip-flops and a nice storm, and that might make me curious about their awareness of self-care or preparing, that kind of stuff. And chances are, knowing their story is they were profoundly not cared for, why would these things matter to them. Functioning delays are often evidence that someone doesn't really care much about themselves. We kind of treat ourselves the way we were parents. We kind of treat ourselves the way we were parents. We kind of treat ourselves the way we were parented.",

And, of course, there are other examples, but these are examples of self-soothing, that again come from an external thing, the perfectionism or the looking or the A's or the drugs, instead of having a safe home base at home, regardless of what age the child is. The child or the teenager is doing their best, and the strategies are often really genius given the situation that they're growing up in. However, these coping strategies can carry on into our adulthoods, and it looks this as adults. We can be workaholic instead of knowing how to manage and soothe our feelings, really being disconnected. We can be attached to processes to feel more secure, such as needing that cup of coffee from that place before we go to bed. We can be attached to processes to feel more secure, such as needing that cup of coffee from that place before we go to bed. Or working at that time or eating the same thing for lunch every day. , this one doesn't have to be black and white. It depends on you, and it depends on your personal story and how it might relate to your trauma. We all have things , I going to a coffee shop every day and getting sort of similar things, but usually it's not something that I need to have happen every day to feel grounded or secure. that's kind of my point there. What prevents a child from developing self-soothing as opposed to external resources is when they are taught early to manage and talk about feelings and situations that come up with their safe home base. Again, imagine being a new kindergartner. At the end of the first day, imagine having a parent that you're able to reconnect with and discuss how the day went. And that's a loving experience of reconnection and celebration. And that's the thing that resets kids from their fear or their anxiety through a transition. Most clients, including myself, in most instances didn't have that and needed to rely upon , say, playing video games or going home and watching the Brady Bunch and sit in that loneliness, but still have something that we can kind of latch on to.

If you land on a ladder, which is pretty cool, you jump ahead from, , say, spot 17 to 33. And hopefully you eventually land on the final spot of 100 and you win the game or maybe your first one there. When you land on the chutes, though. Which is a good idea. There's a slide in the game and you end up way behind the others. And picture little kids playing this. Say you were at spot 33 and you hit a chute and now you're back at spot two. And now your friends are up on spot 67 and somebody else in the group is close to winning the game at 100. For little kids, the game gets pretty emotional because someone is always doing better than they are. And kids being little humans, they assume that their playmates are doing better because they are better. , they're a better kid. They're a better kid than you are. Does anyone remember that feeling about your friends in childhood that they were just better or somehow they had what you didn't have. A four year old doesn't understand that spinning a wheel is about chance. Chutes and Ladders is not a skill based game. It's just kind of winners and losers by chance, which doesn't sound very fun, but it's just a board game. An important note is that when we're little, we developmentally feel the need to win because it's tied to forming a healthy sense of self. It's a healthy sense of self. It's a healthy sense of ego. being first is really important to a three or four year old. Winning Chutes and Ladders or say having a parent react to our drawings when we're little is about developing a sense that we exist in the world and that we're good and that we're doing good things. We're also battling this inherent human emotion of shame that just comes with being born at the same time as trying to figure out if we're lovable or not. this stuff is really important.

But that is very different to a child not having a safe emotional home base at home or at all with a parent. Again, while they're trying to become a person. Getting to the point of this video, picture that child subconsciously getting stuck in this shell. Getting stuck in the chutes and ladders in their lives with those high stakes that carry on through their adulthood. not feeling secure and terrified of the chutes because the chutes are going to feel evidence about something about you. when we played when we were four. Where they're vigilant about the chutes and they actually don't believe the ladders are going to help them or get them closer to winning. But in reality, the ladders are very helpful in life. But we can't take in the ladders because we're preoccupied with the chutes. If that makes sense. And I'm not saying we're childish or that we're a complete mess or victim me or that we are choosing not to handle what other people seem to handle. Take this in that is all just noise and BS from the outside world, especially when that outside world doesn't get childhood trauma. I am saying though that those who grow up in physical and emotional and sexual abuse. They have to fight a lot harder to hide the insecurity and that is more about the chutes and they don't trust the ladders. And maybe their peers don't have to fight hard to do that. what it felt to me in my experience. Imagine a group of four-year-olds playing this game. And one of them was already told at home that morning that they're selfish or that they don't have any common sense or that they're treated with intense contempt. Or one of those children didn't sleep very because their parents had a violent fight the night before. All without any repair or reconnection or soothing. Or maybe they didn't know if one of their parents was a victim. Or maybe they didn't know if one of their parents was a victim.

And the child who's really struggling spins a one and they're in last place. And on the next move they land on a chute which takes them from 34 to 17. Do you think that they're going to feel they have a chance to winning against the kids who seem more confident. Would you conclude that they're a better kid if you were that kid. All the while they're again they're trying to become a person in the world. And the other kids are kind of doing the same. But might they feel everything is unfair. juxtaposed against that scene, imagine having lived your first 18 years of life by having a healthy parent. Who can help you manage and soothe your emotions. Ranging from not winning a game at say three or four. To managing say your first breakup with somebody at age 17. Or managing a nasty boss at your first breakup. Or managing a nasty boss at your first grocery store who's kind of inappropriate with you as a teen. Or manage your body changing. Or even if they're getting you away from an unsafe other parent. And they're able to talk to you about it. Insecurity isn't a choice. It's often our history that we're trying to deal with or we need to deal with. The traumatic events can be at home or out and about in the world. Life is actually pretty traumatic. But it's about not having kids stay in their trauma responses. And where they have to live from a very unsure and insecure place is really what counts. Related to our childhood, here are some common quick examples about emotional insecurity in our adulthood. Let's say you go on a job interview and you're extremely anxious and you freeze due to a childhood trauma response. And you end up not getting the job because you weren't your best. That's going to be negative feedback which is what I'm going to be talking about later. Another example is a common one. You want real intimacy. But you can't stop asking the person you're dating if they're mad at you. Which kind of can get old and sour the relationship. That's abandonment stuff and insecurity stuff.",

That's about feeling not good enough and comparing ourselves to others. Let's see. Another one is you want to speak up or set a boundary and give your opinion to someone. But you don't trust yourself. And you end up missing the point. And you end up missing your chance to speak or you default to the opinions of someone else. And I know this feels exhausted. Some other quick lifelong patterns is a pattern feeling that people do things to you on purpose instead of them being human. forgetting to hold a door open for you. A pattern of noticing differences. That last one, real or imagined, remember what I said in the beginning. A pattern of noticing differences instead of similarities in people. Comparing ourselves instead of relating is another sign. A pattern of feeling you're fine. A pattern of feeling you're forgotten about in the world. Notice how all of those examples are about wanting something greater in our life and putting energy into that. But it feels you're landing on a lot of shoots and you're not getting ahead where you want to be as a person. And to be honest, we just want what everyone else wants. it's very normal. But those examples, they are also about us not trusting our ability to handle things in life. To go after what we want. But the thing is, and probably the most important thing in this video. When we land on a shoot as a childhood trauma survivor, we interpret it as a confirmation about something defective within us. much that everything will look and feel a shoot in our life. And again, related to all that, I'm not saying that people aren't jerks because that's an issue in society. I'm not saying there aren't big differences, especially in this late stage capitalistic thing that we're in. Or a patriarchal system that's a big issue about fairness and equality and equity. The adult winning shoots and ladders is the person in our present life who maybe they bought a house early with help from parents. Or they can afford their health insurance. Or maybe they can simply afford their rent. These are very real things.",

It's not always about chance. What I am saying is this might be all we have to control now is our emotional security issues or our work. That our present insecurity issues can maybe be fueled by our emotional insecurity from our family of origin stuff. It's very hard to feel confident in a job interview if you've been told you're an F up your whole life. It's kind of what I'm getting at. That's the focus of the channel. Here are some more examples. Some of the honorable, nieable messages that we've received recently regarding our overcome boredom or dice or our present anxiety. One is we really need to forget the fact that we suffer from overcome boredom. But also inherit all of our memories of a hope. That your present anxiety or your present anxiety becomes more persistent as it settles in with a found comfort and fit. might they stay in relationships longer than they need to because they don't want to seem they're being mean or abandoning the other person. Or they might be worried about being alone and they can't tolerate being alone, they stay longer. Do they feel the need to burn something down in order to have permission for themselves to leave something. , do you need to burn a job down or a relationship down or your dead-to-me kind of stuff or leave a friendship. Instead of just sort of saying, no thanks, this is not for me. Do they need to build a case about how someone or a job is a bad person to justify their leaving. Do they stay in a job because they don't want to abandon others in the job. Those who don't struggle with those things can make decisions for themselves on their own -being without feeling that cold rain intense shame about the consequences of their choices on others leaving a job. being forthright and self-preserving.

Incidentally, I don't see this as jealousy, the self-worth thing. In my mind, jealousy is a lot of why do you get to have that. Where this is kind of the insecurity that is more about I'll never have that. I'll never have that. I'll never have that. The first one is feels more personal, a conspiracy against us. I'll never have that because I don't deserve it or I can't catch a break.

Reading into text messages in the speed to which someone responds to us, we take that as evidence about our worth. It's pretty human. But again, how intense is that for you. Might that confirm something about you or you're looking to have it confirm something about you. Another is getting really triggered around in groups and out groups, not being invited to lunch by a group of coworkers or having a friend who spends time with other friends.

Seeing someone get the house, the car, the kids and get all that and education and everything they wanted in life when you might be a very late bloomer myself. I was a late bloomer. Seeing someone on social media, it's a lot of S words, have experiences or a lifestyle that makes you feel really less than. P.

One I forgot to mention is feeling insecure when we're not in a relationship as not being in one might confirm something to our subconscious or our inner child. Which I see as the same kind of a thing in inner child subconscious. How are the worth issues maybe related to our childhood. Some examples from our childhood about our self-worth and security. being a child of neglect where inclusion with engaged parents just didn't happen and subconsciously neglected children know where they stand. Meaning that they might believe a parent loves them because the parent tells them, but the child takes in that the parent really never spends time with them. And it's , oh, I'm not going to be able to do that. And it's a message that the child might not be fully conscious to, but they're taking it in. Another is being a scapegoated child where having worth was impossible since you were listed as the family problem at all times. Another is experiencing being left behind at school due to neglect or at home either around not keeping up academically or struggling with a disability, struggling with trouble socializing, struggling with bullies. School is usually one's first huge struggle with self-worth when we're not safe at home. not safe at home. In a big one, another example is growing up in poverty or chaos where normative dreams such as having a house or a happy marriage or having consistency with a parent never materialized. It's a doomish feeling about not making it that was based really in reality considering our childhood. Kids can often feel hyper aware of that and that other kids might have a cleaner or saner home and we can internalize that. Another example is not being protected by a parent who had the power to protect us. This is what I call the safer parent and I recently did a whole video on the safer parent idea or issue.",

Think of which type of feedback is more activating for you and why. And an interesting side note about emotional security around feedback is we can also get really triggered when we're giving feedback to somebody because that's really rooted in our worth or our shame if we're doing it. A lot of us feel if we give someone a compliment are we being manipulative and we'll really get into our head about it. That's also a sign of emotion. That's also a sign of emotional insecurity. We can also kind of be blunt too or too flowery or give up our power when we're giving feedback. here are how the feedback issues can come from childhood. And I think of these as directly stated or indirectly implied abusive family messages. If we had a parent who expressed their love but their behavior didn't back that up. I love you kind of stuff but they aren't around or they're unpredictable or they struggle with addiction. We can really distrust positive feedback because it felt a lie, growing up in the math of the parents behavior doesn't add up, but we feel shame about how we're feeling is you love me, but you don't show up.

We want to be connected. there's that. there's that. loss of connection with family or community and loss of connection with self. Here are some examples about how romantic intimacy triggers emotional insecurity and yes, they're gonna probably line up with your attachment style in some way, but it's not really the focus. The feeling that your partner is cheating and you're accusing them of that, real or imagined. Another example is feeling the person will eventually leave, the person you're romantically attached with will eventually leave or that there's a time limit to it, subconsciously you feel it's gonna end at some point, even when you don't want to. A feeling at any day now it will be over and they will find someone better and think of this is waiting for the other shoe to drop around the attachment, which is a version of hypervigilance. Another is hiding one's emotions from a partner in fear of burdening them or having them be angry with you or disgusted and feeling caught between wanting help when it doesn't feel safe to kind of ask for that help and we have to really take some risk here to get out of that kind of stuff. Another is not bringing things up, nothing is really a problem until it blows up or breaks or explodes or the reverse of that where everything is being brought up by you or everything is a problem to kind of create a familiar dynamic from childhood and be able to actually create distance with problems. Another is not dating someone at your level for perhaps the belief that you can't be at a healthier person's level. If you can nail that and fix it, your life will change.",

Imagine if as a child your family valued working on things from fairness to justice with siblings or whatever or as a child that elephants in the room could be brought up in safety and addressed or as a child all your feelings could be tolerated in a good enough way and voiced as your feelings inform us we're taught your feelings are important because they inform us as a human being imagine if we had parents that told us that or simply you saw the adults in your life model healthy conflict and communication and maintained respect. And I'm not saying that we should be that. I'm not saying that we should be that. I'm not saying that we should be that. For each other in that conflict. Imagine if you saw people being both caring and direct at the same time. That's a lot of environmental emotional security that some people actually get it's rare, but that happens. What would it mean for you if we got that as a thought exercise usually myself we leave our childhood home without any emotional confidence. I don't know about you, but I really had to wing it through adulthood until problems started to kind of come up and I had to address them. Here are some examples of not being emotional. I'm not saying that we should be emotionally confident from childhood that stay with us through adulthood notice how these are relational and that we lack confidence because we often only see threats. We only see the shoots in these scenarios. One is feeling unsure if our feelings are valid or if we're allowed to have them. There's a lot of apologizing for having basic feelings not trusting what you perceive having not a lot of confidence that you're you're all and not responsible or that you can actually have opinions God forbid another example is feeling. Intense shame or rage when someone doesn't validate what you're feeling or wrong about a situation not feeling confident about being believed coming back to real or imagine stuff. Another is feeling caught between having feelings yet convinced you're going to be shot down or attacked for them or in trouble for them again real or imagine.",

Another is expecting people to read our mind. read what is going on for you without you having to tell them it's usually projecting of wanting to be noticed or parented along probably with not feeling confidence about how to talk about it or believing the person should be omnipotent a parent that is a subconscious belief. That's not really a conscious kind of belief. It's inner children really feel one. They don't feel confident in saying things but we can look at people close to us is a little bit why don't they know can't they read my face. How do they not know that kind of stuff. Another is vacillating between going. Really big in a fight response and blowing up and then going to a fond place when the other person's response. That's a really hard inner child cycle and nothing requires its own video. It feels refusing to lose and feeling you need to go big up front. And then when you do go big up front that kind of backfires you really can get submissive after being really upset and the submissive is about how the person responds notice how interpersonal emotional confidence and it's often rooted in a one. One down power structure they're not going to get it. They're not going to listen. I'm probably wrong not today Satan. I'm going to go for it and really tell them off and then feeling quickly. Sorry for bringing that up and I've already given some, , childhood scenarios where it comes from. But here are some other scenarios being overpowered in communication by aggressive or a mentally off parent not being believed when we're in distress not witnessing a parent be able to communicate feelings appropriately when they are in distress. Or in conflict. Another is having a parent who was submissive or codependent had a poor sense of self or self-esteem or was kind of emotionally limited. Another is being scapegoated or neglected or experiencing changes quick changes and caretakers without consistent attachment. Here are some potential healing ideas around emotional confidence is building emotional confidence can be helped in two specific things in my mind. One is being willing to take an emotionally mature risk.",

They're not very process oriented. They tend to think about what their feelings are instead of inherently knowing them, which is a common sign for childhood trauma across the board. It's not unlike the other four that I'll discuss. They can be quite lovely and personable, but difficult to fully know. They can be available yet distant. They can also be kind of freaked out by high feeling people and probably be a little bit annoyed by them. Doers can be also chaotic. They don't have to be ducks in a row. They can kind of be very chaotic. It's tough. It's tough. It's still doing. It's still a reacting. They can be super functioning and they can be super disorganized. Doers can be pretty dissociative and rush into action, but they aren't aware that they're showing really emotion. doers are surprised when people reflect back to them that you seem tense. You seem intense. You seem tense and that's a shock to the doer. The doer trauma personality is rooted in the flight response. But that seems tricky as someone who is who say addicted to substances is also in the flight response. what is the doer fleeing from. I believe the doer is escaping being present for not knowing or not wanting the mess of their own childhood or their own emotions to come up. They can be addicted to action instead of substances in this case, but they can also be addicted to substances. If they have dual things going on. The doer has never really had the safety and encouragement to sit with their feelings as to have a safe person sit with them in their feelings, which is common for a lot of us. How the doer personality is formed in childhood. Achieving and doing are amazing coping strategies that kids come up with when things are unsafe, chaotic, or they're raised in families of doers where no one really knows how to do feelings in a tricky family. Picture a child living in say violence or chaos or a highly depressive shut down parent as their caretaker.",

They often have to spend some time noticing the myriad of ways that they are instantly trying to skip out of their feelings by the doing, and they kind of have to buy into the fact that the doing just keeps them kind of separated from people just in childhood. They can do the work if they're willing to look at how childhood set them up, and they're also gonna have to be willing to have their childhood become more real to them, I mentioned, for them to emotionally process and reclaim, that's the doer. Moving on to the second personality is what I'm calling the hostile. Hey, listen to me. The hostile is someone who got caught up and stuck in. They have a fight response that was either modeled for them by their parents and in a high conflict family, or it's what the child had to come up with to adapt to their environment to survive. The hostile typically isn't hostile 24 seven, but some definitely can be. Some examples and some qualities of the hostile. Hostiles can have a knee jerk reaction to perceived criticism and get defensive or do something called jade, justify, argue, defend, or explain. In subtle ways, even if you agree with them, they might have to have the last kind of thought or the last word to clarify you or correct you. They can struggle with a dismissive avoidant or fearful avoidant attachment style. Some live in hostility, I mentioned. Some get in their car, hit a big line at the drive-through, rage honk just because of that, and they live in this kind of F my life kind of mode. They can be pretty miserable, unfortunately. Some can be quite chill until they're really triggered, usually by intimacy or how others perceive them, and then that hostility comes out. Hostiles can keep score, even go to places of being neurotic around things , WTF, I bought you a coffee six months ago. What is this. Hostiles can have control issues. This is how they can function in intimacy. They need to be.",

This is, I'm just vibing. This is just me. The hostile has a relationship fantasy that is I would love it if you would just listen to me and we just have this one way street thing where I give advice and you take the advice and we would just be fine. that's their relational kind of stance. Isn't this just how I am. The hostile can feel fixed in that they're simply just an intense and overly opinionated person and that's it. , I'll debate anyone and I'll fight anybody. And I know that sounds extreme but my point is I don't think hostiles were this when they were two or when they were one. Our trauma conditioning runs really deep and it gets compounded as we grow into adults. And yes, it's very possible and likely to have born strong-willed. That can definitely happen. That happens all the time, but children can be strong-willed and still maintain kindness and connection with others. My clients who are hostiles, again, including myself, are very capable of gradually softening if they want that. They have to see the hostility as a problem, but not much if they don't see it as a problem and embrace kind of more of double down on who they are, which also happens too, unfortunately. Hostiles struggle to want to be more chill, but they're bothered by everything, which really gets exhausting. How to become more real. How the hostile can become more present and authentic is doing work around softening, which paradoxically is exactly what the abuse was about, being labeled as say weak or soft or something that, not having any power. that feels kind of a no-go zone for them, but self-compassion that is taught by safe people helps soften a hostile whom they respect and trust.",

They're definitely heartbroken. Maybe the darkness is just more out with it than the other personalities. The darkness could have experienced a lot of contempt from a toxic parent, and it could become really intensely clear that things weren't going to be sane or loving or become safe or loved or even respected. they did the thing and they embraced the kind of darkness as a way, as a good kind of defense mechanism, kind of a giving up, which a weird kind of a thing about how giving up can kind of get somebody through a horrific situation. And they might say, if I'm not gonna be lovable or safe, I'm just gonna embrace what I'm experiencing it's not that bad. the abuse becomes more kind of poetic to them sadly, which is kind of a good strategy. They're kind of externalizing it. Other possibilities is growing up where nothing really worked, having a hopeless parent who modeled the same kind of vibe or severe neglect, how the darkness personality would struggle in intimacy. The darkness will struggle with how to know how to relate without being negative. They don't really know another way to express themselves because positivity might feel lame, foreign or fake or inauthentic. They will really struggle with positivity, which I also did too and I get that. They can create distance by presenting themselves as being too messed up or too complicated for the other person to handle. They can also say point blank at the beginning, you're gonna get sick of me and leave me, which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The darkness has a relationship fantasy that's , I would love it if you could just agree with me that nothing works and you really, really get that, what I'm saying and value me for that truth. Expecting love kind of by being dark or thinking being dark is sort of lovable. And it's a little bit tricky to articulate. A good therapist would want the darkness to be able to start processing that. That really was dark growing up, but the present is different. And they can maybe deal with that together.",

Ghosts can seem fine when you really don't know what's going on with them, and then all of a sudden they send you a text about how you've hurt them that comes out of the blue. They're capable of that as. They can have a bit of sporadic hostility because they really don't know how to bring things up unless they bottle and blow kind of a thing. Ghosts can be very hurt in that it takes a lot of energy for them to be part of something, and then they can get greatly hurt when they get feedback that they're too quiet. They can want others to read their mind they don't really have to express themselves at times. A ghost can be incredibly stuck and unable to take care of something. And a ghost can also be sort of charming and sort of present to a superficial level, but there's not much more than that. Here's how childhood set up the ghost. Some possibilities that can very much the others be learned from having a shutdown or a ghost- parent or avoidant parents can be from significant neglect where there really wasn't any joyful kind of connection in the early years, and then having to go through a very lonely, quiet childhood where no one was home. They're kind of not socialized maybe in that way on a deep level. If you picture a super-social child, they're kind of a super-social child, but they're a severely neglected child who gets themselves up and fed and out to school in the morning. And then they're alone again when they come home from school until nine and when a parent comes home. And then it's ten. There's a lot of alone time. It's a lot of having to shut down for a minute, minute. what I mean. That's actually very dissociative experience for a child. A kid will have to find ways to cope with that kind of abandonment on a daily level. Another possibility is being overwhelmed by a larger-than-life experience. The ghost can be a very negative kind of energy vampire parent or that there was much intensity from violence or chaos that the ghost rightfully kind of shut down. This is also highly common.",

They will often come across as having rose-colored glasses, I'm sure you're familiar with some of this stuff, giving everybody a break, positive vibes, and they will tend to cope with a lot of optimism, and none of that is really real though.

To be just frustrated or annoyed with a partner or your dog or the neighbor or something that. Think of all the energy it takes to not be upset by anything and that's the are we good. Because they're focused on being lovable or tolerated in the world. How to become more real. For the are we good, 12 step programs Al-Anon or CODA or ACOA are great places to start and to learn about this kind of strategy that they have, the trauma response and look for how they operate. There's a great thing in ACOA called the laundry list. And there's an alternative laundry list. Highly suggest that. I'll actually put a link in the video. In therapy with a good therapist, there would hopefully be some encouragement about how to dip down into those good things. Those childhood trauma feelings. Or simply be taking more risk to talk about what is it to not take care of the therapist. What is it to be the focus. Group therapy is again excellent for all these if it's the fit. If it's a working interpersonal group where the peers help each other kind of dig down and go more into authenticity. And actually kind of say to the are we good that it's triggering to be taken care of by someone. It's actually kind of annoying to be on the receiving end of that. And that's just, it's not judgment. It's just how it is. And I'm sure that someone who struggles with that people pleasing would understand that too. They don't it either. Also getting healthy feedback from how the group sees us is that missing mirroring that we didn't get kind of growing up in a vacuum. And a good therapist wants the are we good to start to kind of get more pissed off that they are asked to do more at work. To get pissed off in their relationship that it's a bit one-sided. To get pissed off with their friends that again it's one-sided because that's what they're kind of known for.

That's what I sort of mean by that. we are super, super tuned in to other people's moods, potentially for those reasons growing up. And yes, chances are if you're interested in these videos, you're probably hypersensitive. That is both a blessing and a curse. But to be honest, there is work to do with our inner child about not letting them feel they are responsible for everyone's emotional experiences. This can be really hard to let go of, as it was for me. How to parent our inner child on this one, is to let them know that in the present, everybody is on their own path. Everyone is responsible for their own feelings. And it doesn't always mean that something really bad is about to happen when other people are feeling their feelings. But also to validate your inner child that growing up, you did have to know what others were feeling in order to keep yourself safe and keep yourself afloat. there's that. Number two. This one's weird. Ambiguity.",

    "text": "This is really what I find interesting. I find to be one of the most prevalent triggers is not knowing how things are going to go. Some examples. Not hearing back from a job. Having a global pandemic going on and not knowing what the future is going to bring. Not knowing if the date enjoyed the date as much as you did. Having an email exchange at work that you read as heated or aggressive but then it just gets dropped for a while. Having to wait for exchanges in a bump with a partner or someone we care about. Not knowing if your partner is really upset. Waiting on social plans to get shored up while sitting on feelings FOMO and not wanting to be alone. This one is tough. I believe it's rooted in fundamental security. My mentor says that every child needs a safe home base to be able to weather what life brings for them. And we didn't get that in childhood. From a childhood trauma view, we grew up without that safe home base and we were insecure. And we waited to feel. It's almost when you think about insecurity. I find that many of my clients struggle with insecurity, including myself. It was external things that made me feel. It did not come from an internal source. In my case growing up, the security issues were around waiting. I was raised by two very neglectful alcoholics and my siblings and I waited for the adults to come home without knowing when they would be home. In addition to that, it was ambiguous about what kind of condition they would come home in. Because we knew we were banking on trying to get our needs met, which meant sort of our security. That meant the field trips signed, the milk money for school the next day, whatever we needed. We simply just needed to feel there was an adult home. All of that stuff, that waiting, I feel contributes to the ambiguity and security. I think ambiguity bothers us because we struggle in being secure within ourselves. Sure. And waiting to hear back on a job is tough. Or waiting for a second date that we really liked is sort of hard. But wouldn't it be great if we didn't get consumed in it.",

I really think it comes from having a deeper, deeper relationship with our inner child that we can feel secure unto ourselves. And while someone being able to, , turn, another belief thing is the ability to be able to turn stuff over. To turn it over to fate or the ability to let go. A spiritual practice in some sort is very helpful to let go of sort of things. And why. Because due to our trauma is we rely too heavily on external confirmation that we're than rather developing it from within. that's what I mean by ambiguity on that one. And the last one. The last one is a big one. The last one is feedback. I look at feedback as three types. Positive, negative, and neutral. They are all triggering in their own weird ways. Positive feedback can be triggering to shame because as childhood trauma survivors our body can interpret compliments or doing on something as potential manipulation or it can just feel icky. I think that this is due to growing up somehow where we were manipulated. Or doing was at a sibling's expense. Or the parent being positive was somehow icky to how that parent lived their life. Positive feedback is difficult because it's how the person is giving us that feedback doesn't match the insides. that's why it's often hard for us to take a compliment because it just feels kind of, your shame is activated if you can't take a compliment. Negative feedback. This is sadly more comfortable for us. Because it's probably more familiar. But it can also be triggering if growing up criticism was really unfair. your brother did a better job at that even though they're five years older than you. that kind of stuff. Another issue is negative feedback can be devastating because we might take it too seriously because we feel people don't have the to criticize us because they don't know what's going on with us. Coming back to the earlier one. Sort of about mind reading. That's also a familiar vibe from childhood. Where too much was asked of us.",

I think that drives us crazy because we don't trust what they mean. what I mean. it's sort of a professor is how was the paper. It's , it was alright. You did the thing. And there's not anything big. There's not really negative about it. It's I think we struggle more with this one because now we're going to ruminate. We're going to ruminate about do I trust them. they must have hated it and they're trying to be nice. That's a common one. All that stuff. Most importantly. in the group work that I do. It's modeled to take care a lot of these feedback issues and intimacy issues because each person in my group is they're getting healthy feedback from healthy people. And the trauma survivor's sort of job, each member's job is to be able to ride their body's trigger while trying to stay in present and receive the feedback, receive the intimacy sort of from other group members. that's where trying to undo all of this stuff there. And as my mentor says growing up, feedback got wrecked, which hands down is such a wise thing because it's we're growing up in such conditional love that the feedback is just warped. the work there is really hard about getting feedback.

Is he still a stranger to you. does he put in any work to get to know you, or is he a mess that you have to help out, and rescue, and be a parent for.

And the third one of the big three is how a daughter feels about herself as a lasting problem. As a society, we still don't recognize how important fathers are for our sense of self and our development. an example is, do you still struggle to feel lovable or valuable, not just with your father.

You might be a little bit freaked out about how applicable these are to you because you've probably thought that these only are unique to you, but they're actually pretty common for childhood trauma. Here's how I'll format this video real quick. I'm going to talk about the examples of each issue, how they might come from childhood trauma, and finally some treatment recommendations on how to really rethink them or what to kind of do about them. let's just get into it. Here you go. You might feel an impact from some of these, but just to let , I see these as really normal reactions, normal things that we have going on for growing up in an abnormal development. number one is something that I call emotional delay. Emotional delay is when an emotion about something takes several hours or even a day to catch up with you. there's the event, then there's you in the present, and then there's the emotions kind of catching up to you in the present. Let's say your boss or your partner asks something of you in the moment, and in that moment, you just kind of automatically said yes. And the day goes on and that kind of a thing. And then gradually you start to feel a pain of anger or a little bit of an escalation. And finally, the emotion is , wait a minute, was I just taken advantage of. Could be a situation that, or it could be you see something ugly earlier in the day between other people, and then later it catches up with you, something you see on the street. Or someone tells you that they can't. Can't make a commitment that they committed to you. And then you're in the moment, you're , don't worry about it. It's fine. And then later you feel really let down, really disappointed. This feels kind of an escalation of emotion that you weren't in touch with at the time of the event earlier in the day. And it just simply catches up to you. I mentioned, you'll really know about this if you've ever gotten a rush of buildup of emotion that you can't quite place and then realize it was about that interaction earlier. How this might come from childhood trauma.",

It's almost the idea is to become a good parent for yourself and really become aware of what is going on with you, which is a process in the day to day. Another is to join a group or find a therapist if you can or join a community such as a support group, say Al-Anon or some kind of 12 step. I know that those are complicated for a lot of people and start to practice discussing how you feel in the in the moment around some safe people in 12 step. I learned how to truly where I learned how to publicly speak and catch up with my emotions in addition to the group therapy that I went in. we should all be getting this stuff from our families, but we simply don't. Moving on to number two, which is what I call rushing nowhere, rushing nowhere or rushing through life, as I believe, is due to living in an emergency due to. In childhood, we really live that way. Some examples you ever catch yourself walking too fast for no really reason, you're in a rush somewhere. Ever jump into basic things you're now on a mission to get it done, securing movie tickets or something that, a reservation or something. Ever find yourself treating basic things life or death situations. You might see this in others and be , Whoa, where's the fire. what is going on there. This may look very different. For. Those who identify as being neurodivergent, just FYI. not everything is universal in terms of applying. this can look you just got a master's degree and now you feel the immediate need to get your doctorate or get a new kind of thing or get the spouse or get the house and get the baby. It's a hurry up and reach, , the elder years super fast. That's kind of an one example of rushing or this can look unconsciously going fast in life. Over small things where you kind of realize that you have zero chill in life. You're very much Johnny on the spot on top of things that you really don't know how to slow down.",

Being tired can trigger us to feeling sad. we try to keep the party going a little bit. anytime that we're, anytime we come back into our body and being tired will do that, we might get triggered to that because now we're going to have to feel things. Another is the hypervigilant trauma brain does not rest because we can't be vigilant when we're resting. Another idea is the inner child might fear of missing out or FOMO about kind of going to bed or being tired. some treatment ideas on this one. It's really simple is to connect with your inner child. again with this dialoguing tool and ask them why getting tired might be a bummer for them. What does it mean. What are they feel they're missing out on. What is it. Does it make them feel a little bit sad or disconnected. in the inner adult can do some work around better sleep hygiene, such as doing some somatic mindfulness around reclaiming the idea that being tired is such an and natural thing. And it's about our body communicating with us. While the trauma brain is stepping in to say, oh, no, it's not about it's about something else. I don't want to I don't want to feel tired. Moving on to number five is something that I call chameleon, but don't mix certain friends can't know about certain friends. This one isn't just about being a chameleon where we can change vibes and personas to fit in. I remember in high school, I can I could hang out with the jocks or the burnouts or the nerds and be part of them and switch gears and kind of, , adapt to the whatever social situation. I just really think it's many of us kind of can do that growing up in childhood trauma because we don't really have our own authentic sense of self. we can just take on a whole bunch of personas. It's a skill of adapting but we struggle with knowing what our real identity is, to not being able to develop one in safety other healthy kids might be able to do that. an added layer to this is not mixing for some reason we have issues around. co-workers that we not meeting our outside friends.",

We have to talk to the adults. Adults can be terrifying especially if you're struggling with shame and if you're really neglected. Another example where it might come from is not being given any space in the family. I'm not sure. Having parents who are terrified themselves about being seen they may maybe they have extreme neurotic stuff about being in a picture or something looking bad in some way. And there could be a lack of safety being visible while expressing emotions and this feeling we're in trouble if we're emotional or if we have to present or if we have to talk some treatment recommendations for this one with the others. Find safe people to talk about emotions in real time. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. The crawl Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. Increase. just getting more and more comfortable. And lastly, dialogue with the inner child, again, about what is gonna happen if we make ourselves seen or we have to present or what happens to us when we are the focus. Talking to them about specific examples of being on the spot at home growing up is gonna be helpful too. Moving on to number seven is what I call laughing about the pain. This is a subtle social issue that comes up when we're expressing a bit of ourselves or a bit of our story. What this looks is when we jokingly talk about our abusive or horrific childhood situations in kind of an overly casual or kind of funny way. You'll know when this happens when others are , whoa, you. While the survivor isn't fully connected with the severity about what they're talking about. Essentially, they're not taking themselves seriously because that's a thing. And I think our inner child pops up in these situations and starts to talk about the pain and tell the truth about what happened to us, which comes out sideways, which is another thing on the list.",

Another is the ability to be comfortable being alone as kind of a recharge without feeling abandoned, left out, FOMO or existentially off if we're alone or if we're single. Another is the ability to make good decisive choices in a good enough way without intense discomfort or self doubt. The same coin is the ability to change our mind without shame even if changing our mind impacts others. Another is having a sense of one's personhood and kind of sovereignty in the world where one doesn't need to assimilate in somebody else's life or a group and not really be a chameleon depending on social situations. Another is the ability to give voice and advocate and push back for one's self even prior to say puberty and during development. Choices, ideas, preferences. Healthy kids can do that and healthy parents discern how much pushing back is and how much is not. It's the idea of shared power with children, not power all on the kids, not power all on the adults. as a side note, the term in all that list, the term ability doesn't mean that it's going to be super easy breezy. A lot of those things are still going to be uncomfortable but the person has the ability to do that those things because they have a healthy sense of self. how might we have an undeveloped sense of self from childhood trauma. I'm going to give you another list here of contrasting scenarios and ideas between healthy parenting and unhealthy parenting. Healthy parents allow for differences among children and siblings and having those differences even be celebrated. Unhealthy parents assign abusive roles to their children such as the smart one or the scapegoat or the adult provider that's parentification. And also conflating individual needs and interests as selfish. To be someone needs to burden others. Healthy parents support their children in their choices and feelings such as not wanting to play with another kid anymore due to things being one-sided or that they're just a friendship is dwindling. In that scenario, unhealthy parents are overly concerned about how the other kid would feel which takes away our sense of self.",

    "text": "And we do a lot of that work in my membership where I teach those skills or we're having to work with our inner child who is still operating from the childhood trauma place. The second way you could start to build up having a sense of self is really looking at the concepts of feelings and relationship to self. In many ways, our feelings equal self. If you don't know where to start in terms of rebuilding a sense of self, start to focus on your feelings. Feelings are really the fuel to self and self is the action or the engine. Let's walk through this idea through a diagram. we have the two basic ideas of feelings and self. On the feeling side, feelings such as being inspired by something, boundaries are not really feelings but we definitely feel things when people cross our boundaries or we don't state them. Feelings such as sad, mad, joy, feelings such as attraction, feelings. On the left side we have self which is kind of concrete things decisions, assertion, choices, aspirations. And I put inevitability there as I'm not trying to make a spoof on a Marvel movie because I think Thanos said that in an Avengers movie. Inevitability is really understanding our beautiful uniqueness in the universe. There's only one of us and that's kind of an inevitable kind of a thing. That's a sense of self kind of concept that's kind of interesting to me. And another power is a huge ingredient to sort of self. And notice how one is about action and on the feeling side is fuel. Where they overlap is where the kind of magic comes in here is being authentic. When someone can be authentic it tells us that they have a sense of self. When they can be real, same kind of a thing. When they can be empowered to themselves and push back on things. When they can be spontaneous. Not impulsive but spontaneous and a healthy way. I really think that's really kind of showing us that we've done a lot of childhood trauma work. We can set limits. We can know our own limits. We can kind of come back to our intuition. And what I about this idea of sense of self is coming back to Carl Jung and individuation is we are separate.",

I mean we all need to be part of things but I think as a trauma survivor, again coming back to that concept of having a life vest is what I mean. Moving on to another variation of this. This shows how it works is that feelings being the fuel drive the sense of self more. And the action that comes from sense of self when we make decisions, when we assert ourselves, we're doing limits. When we make decisions we're being more authentic. We're being more real. When we work on and kind of work on our aspirations we might be spontaneously going out to take a painting class. Our inevitability is also applicable to our separateness. Our power is about setting limits or knowing our limits. they really kind of affect each other in interesting ways. what you can do with that, those ideas from the diagram is to do some journal writing on your feelings specifically what did you feel as a kid when you were going through your trauma. Be as specific as you can here about the feelings and situations. Those feelings were the fuel of your sense of self that actually kind of got lost. some examples here's what I mean. I'm trying to say that the sense of self was always there and is there. We just have to do some work around it. Some examples of journal writing is did you really dislike or feel uncomfortable around the step parent. Those were your feelings. Did you feel aware that parents invested more in say one of your siblings because of their gender or personality or something. Those were your feelings. Did you feel bad for a parent and wanted them to be happier and more present for you. Those were your feelings. Did you hate the way that you were treated or how things were dealt with by the adults. Again, those were your feelings. Did you feel intense shame about your family or your situation or all of it. Feelings.

    "text": "What would it have felt if you had a healthy adult in your life that said yes to those things that you were having some big feelings about and it actually had an impact. Meaning, what would have happened if another parent validated your feelings about the step parent and took action to make things better. What would have happened if the parent got honest with you and started to balance the attention between you and say something the golden child. What would have happened if the parent got their life together and focused on you instead of you being aware of them and you being focused on them. And this is not really a would've, should've, could've kind of exercise. It's playing around with what would have happened to your sense of self had you mattered to the adults in your life who could validate what you were feeling. And those are some basics around parenting and basics around how we develop a sense of self. The opposite again is say with the golden child scenario, we just feel invisible, not worthy and we don't have a sense of ourselves after we kind of leave home into adulthood. And in all of those examples and those situations, maybe think of the children's bill of which is in my membership course. These are 10 basic of children during healthy development. And my favorite one is the to affect somebody. All of these examples that I just listed in this exercise meant that we didn't affect our parents. We didn't have an impact on them because whatever reason wasn't our fault and having an impact on parents is crucial to developing a sense of self. It's sort of if you're in pain, they take action. That means we affect them. And coming back to those diagrams and this idea is that sense of self comes from feelings. A potential barrier in a little bit of this work is when we're disconnected from our feelings for various different childhood trauma symptoms such as numbness, dissociation, lack of memory, self doubt, and trauma responses. Those symptoms do not mean that you don't have those feelings underneath. They just kind of eclipse them due to the intensity of the survival mechanisms that you might have going on. what to do with all that.",

    "text": "You don't think about it. It happens. But then there's this after effect. We could call it a ricochet or the fallout of that acute shock to the system. The sympathetic nervous system will often have a sort of a nervous system. And then it's a post-surgical action. And then it's have a release of adrenaline, we might feel pain, we might feel emotion, we might get angry at the coffee table or at ourselves for not seeing it, or someone who moved the coffee table and didn't tell us and our awareness wasn't on point, our system goes into a reaction. And our body wants us in that moment to pause and wait for that high stress to come down. Now you might be saying, Irene, how do that the system wants us to wait. All I can say is trust me, the system, human system does not want to live spiked up in a chronic survival response. It wants to come out of the intense pain, the discomfort, the emotional trauma, the emotional trauma, the emotional trauma, the emotional trauma, the emotional trauma, the emotional trauma, the emotional trauma, the emotional trauma, the emotional flush that comes up. And here's your number one. I'm embedding these how-tos from this day forward. And I say this to my students all the time, and it's probably one of the more underestimated things that you can do to foster greater capacity in your body system that you can release and you can let go of the old abuses, hurts, harms, troubles, et cetera, that have occurred to you. By in that moment, in that moment of stress, acute stress, by really, really feeling, and even just giving yourself maybe 30 seconds, a minute might be better depending on how severe it is, and to really sense, feel, connect, feel the pain, don't ignore the pain. If there is a scream that needs to come out, granted, of course, you don't have children around you. You do not want to harm them or scare them if they're around. this is where my example then takes a choose your own adventure. I'll talk about that in a second. But let's just say it's safe for you to let all this stuff out. Feel it, let it out, process it. Now, I have an ebook.",

That ebook explains the stress response and why we want to really, not just for the sake of pausing and resetting in our day, when we have an acute stress, we want to work with it in the moment. And the reason why is because if we don't, it traps inside of us. It sticks to us. We stay in a chronic state of, activation, fight, flight, or shutdown, because we have shut off feeling that pain because it's just not convenient. make it such that, again, I said, from this day forward, make it almost a good thing that you are pausing when these things occur. Now, this could be stubbing your toe. It could be almost getting into an accident on the road. It could be almost slipping when you're in the shower. It could be hearing, someone scream, not to you, but something that startles you. It could be a stressful conversation, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. It could be an actual, true, real abuse attack, that kind of thing. The thing I said about the kiddos, again, I know, I'm sure there are people here who are parents, and a lot of times people get confused because they say, , shouldn't we show our children emotional processing that they learn it from us. And the answer to that is yes and no, it depends how old they are. If they are young and fully unaware of how to self soothe their own body, and they're still relying on you, the caregiver, to teach them self-regulation, no, you need to actually find a way to feel that hurt and pain and process it later. we'll talk about that too in a second. Because if they see that mom or dad or, or, , if they're in a situation where, , they're feeling very uncomfortable, they're not going to teach them how to do self-regulation. they're going to have to realize, , you're just doing your job, you're just self-regulating, and you're just not going to be able to do it for them.

    "text": "Releasing something in the system is not just shaking. For some, it might be. For others, it might need to be emotions that come out. It might need to be words that need to be spoken. It might need to be movement patterns that weren't allowed to come out that have nothing to do with shaking. And this is where it gets really tricky to say, release is this, because each of us is unique in our history. Each of us is unique in our capacity, and each of us will be unique in how we process. I prefer the word integrate to release, how we bring up and sense and feel, and then integrate what is coming up that it can settle and dissipate and come out. For some, feeling to release is this. Feeling tingles in the body, feeling heat, feeling cold rush through the body, feeling a bubbling up of an emotion, and then being with that emotion and expressing whatever might need to come out is what is the release. It might have nothing to do with physical body parts moving. I just wanted to kind of set that tone as we go a little deeper into this. One of the classic knowings that we are trapped in survival stress and have lots of trapped traumatic stress inside of us, in our organs, in our systems, is that we aren't able to be in the here and now. even as I say that, just take a second. There's 151 people here. As you've been listening to me talk, talk, talk, have you been connected to your body. Have you been connected to feeling your breath. Have you been connected to feeling the ground under you. How are you connected to your somatic body self while you're engaged in this learning mode here. And one of the things that is most difficult for humans to get is that we have animal physiology,. Other mammals in the world have those autonomic stress, survival, parasympathetic, and the somatic systems. For many animals, our internal viscera, our organs are the same with maybe some tweaks, but mostly the same. And we have this animal somatic mammalian body, but then we have this higher brain.",

As boring as it might sound, can you feel the pressure of your body against whatever you're sitting on. Can you have your eyes and attention see and explore. And then you can't just sit there and just sit there and just sit there and just sit there and just explore the space around you and let that come into you or you go to it. When we again, I said, if we've had these scary things happen to us, consider an infant who's not being attuned to. They're crying and crying and crying. And the cry is the cry of I'm too hot. I see this all the time in grocery stores. Baby is crying and you look and they're beet red and they're still all bundled up in their winter clothes. And it's hot in that store. These are true stories. I've seen this and the mother doesn't know or the caregiver doesn't know what to do. And I've seen mothers scream at their babies in stores. And it's , look at the face. They're hot. I've already stripped my jacket off. If that isn't attuned to, if that little one doesn't get what it needs, if that cry can't be listened to, the cry of that is very different than a cry. Of hunger than a cry of a belly being a little distended and gas being held. They, the baby starts to not learn how to self-regulate. They are in a state of stress. And why was I saying that. we have to understand that if that was us, and even if we don't remember it, but I'm saying this to you now, and if something is landing, and if you're starting to feel maybe a little bit of anxiousness, or maybe you're going beet red in the future, you're going to be in a state of stress.

This is why I've seen a few things pop through where people are asking, is this what anxiety is. Is this what panic is. Yes. Some people go through life feeling just fine and they don't know. I don't know what anxiety is. I don't know what panic is. And then they start to learn about this stuff. They start to unfreeze their bodies from the traumas. And they're , wow, , that was me.

Oh, the other thing I wanted to mention there, shaking. sometimes I get questions where people say, I went and I did these trauma release exercises. And now whenever I lay down to track my body, I just start shaking. If our body, here's the thing. If the system has a response, a procedural muscular need to shake out some kind of old event where we weren't allowed to shake out or to protect what's called a incomplete, or sorry, procedural memory. I'll lay the example. If I was attacked when I was a teenager and I couldn't run and get away, and then I was abused, my system still has the procedure in it to run, to kick, to scream, to strangle my assailant. But I couldn't because I had to go into shutdown mode because I could tell I am not going to get out. I can't fight.

I mean, it's , imagine having everything and feeling you have nothing and in everyone else's world, they say to you, you have all the money in the world. You have all the success. You're healthy. How do you not see how good your life is. imagine hearing this from other people. And knowing that you have everything, but inside of you, you feel worthless. You feel undeserving. You feel unloved and you feel you have nothing. That is a prison in my mind. It sucks to be poor and know you have nothing, but to have everything and not appreciate it, man, that's really challenging. And there's that's part of the study of the extreme. And a few years ago I was living in an apartment building here in Los Angeles and I went on a road trip. I came back and there was a tent in the valet. And I was, I was pulling up. I was , I'm going to go to the valet. I'm gonna go to the valet. I'm going to go to the valet. And I pulled up, there was a white tent. I kind of made a joke to the valet attendant.

Thank you for people that made this food. Thank you to whoever made it here preparing this food. It's creating a ritual. It's not worshiping food, but it's creating a beautiful relationship with it. And I think again, our beliefs around food impact and influence our behaviors on what we're gonna eat. And that impacts everything. And the same thing with our beliefs and behaviors around money. You could have just changed everybody's life just now. Getting that part, the same thing with our food and having gratitude and thanksgiving and blessing the food, blessing the people involved in it and having that relationship with money as and not making it, it's not that you're worshiping money because of course that's that tenant that can make people repel money is the root of all evil.

But if you show up for you, you're taking care of that inner child who has all those wounds that you've written down. And you're saying, I'm the adult in the relationship now, I've got you. No matter what anyone else does, I got you. And those boundaries create peace and freedom. And when you tie that to money, it creates financial freedom. I don't think. We talked about this before the show, but a lot of times with achieving a goal or achieving that success that we want, it's about. It's not just about the things we do, it's about the things we stop doing. Because not having those boundaries, that essentially it's a barrier protection.",

Her statement was detailed and shocking that she left no doubt. Joseph Fritzl was still arrested on the same day. The mask of the widowed father and grandfather was finally broken. At his place was a monster that had kept a whole family in a hellhole under his own house. The economic aspects of his crime cannot be underestimated here. Fritzl had not only emotional and physical control over his victims, but also complete financial control. They were dependent on him for every meal, for clothing, for mere survival. This absolute economic dependence was another chain that bound him and undermined his position of power. He not only controlled their bodies, but also their entire existence. He had every possibility to earn his own money or to have his own business. To understand the monstrous act, one must understand the perpetrator. Joseph Fritzl was not an unpredictable monster that emerged out of nowhere. He was the product of a poisonous mixture of criminal energy, cold calculation and a deeply rooted pathological desire for control. His biography is the blue break of a slowly unfolding catastrophe. The roots of his character that needs control are often sought in his own childhood. Born in 1935, he experienced a marked absence. His father left the family and died in the war. His mother, an overwhelmed woman who had never wanted him according to her own statements, raised him with strict hands and blows. This experience of emotional cold and helplessness in childhood can be a foundation for the later forced urge to be a man. This is where the basic pattern of his life may have formed. To be a victim, to become a criminal later.",

They have taken the business of their own life into their own hands, something that has been a challenge for them for decades. something that has been a challenge for them for decades. The legacy of Fritzl's case extends far beyond the family. He forced Austria to rethink its bureaucratic processes, sensitized society and authorities to the signs of invisible suffering, and left a permanent warning. The unimaginable can happen anywhere, hidden behind the facade of normality. But the story of the survivors is also a testament to triumph, a proof that even the most vulnerable can be saved. A proof that even the deepest darkness cannot extinguish the light of the human mind. The case of Joseph Fritzl will forever remain as one of the darkest chapters of criminal history. But beyond the shock and the horror, this tragedy offers profound insights into the human nature, the structures of our society and the tough power of hope. What if the dust has settled. First, this case confronts us with the story of the victim, Fritzl. The story of the victim, Fritzl, is a very disturbing truth, that the evil often has a familiar face. Joseph Fritzl was not a foreign monster, but a neighbor, a family member, a respected member of the community. His story teaches us that we must not let our vigilance be clouded by appearances. The facade of normality can hide the most profound truths, and it is our collective responsibility to look where others look away. The systemic reality of the situation is that the system is not able to control the reality. The system is not able to control the reality. The system is not able to control the reality. The system is not able to control the reality. The system is not able to control the reality. The system is not able to control the reality. The system is not able to control the reality. In the case of Fritzl, the problem is not the security network. It takes a healthy human mind, skepticism and the courage to ask uncomfortable questions. But perhaps the most important heir to this case is the extraordinary survival story of Elisabeth Fritzl and her children.",

How are you. How did you sleep. Hugs and kisses and everything that.

I will please you. I will fix you just that you love me. What's also important to understand with that is when you have deep complex trauma and deep shame, you also have a deep fear of abandonment. And when a person who has received deep trauma, they feel all alone. They feel they have been abandoned by the very people that should be connecting to them.

She needed new tires on her vehicle and it was winter time. And I snuck her car away and I went and got tires for. And. surprised her with tires and that to me was just this act of love because I loved her and I we were in the in that honeymoon phase of our relationship where everything was going really and I just wanted to kind of surprise her with this really nice gift. And then you paint this other side it's the thing I was talking about. I got an email earlier where we have another version. And I'm what part of me was trying to solidify the relationship in a sense it's just it's it's it's those parts of us that you said is the unconscious it's the subconscious parts of us that are really in some ways acting. on our behalf I don't I don't know I don't know because I think about it to Tim where it's I was always.

But at what point do we, sorry, I guess what I'm asking is, when it comes to this type of behavior, is it something that , how is it. I'm getting caught up in my words here. It seems - Can I take a crack at what I think you're getting at. , , that would be great. What I emphasize to people all the time is that true love and codependency actually look the same on the surface. Initially, because you're giving, both are giving, both are making sacrifices, both. Are concerned about the other person, both are wanting to establish connection with the other person. love and codependency on the surface initially look the same. And that's why people get confused.

I'm giving because you have a need and I want to meet it. If you give nothing back, that's fine. there's a different motivation. But the second part to that where it begins to change is codependency over time. You begin to see it because the relationship is always out of balance. My needs always matter less than yours. Whereas with true love, your needs matter just as much as mine. It's always going to end up balanced. I ask you, how you're feeling this morning because I care. Not because I now have to adjust my day and my moods to make sure you're happy. But that's a loving thing to do. And if you're having a bad day, I go, is there any way I can help. I don't then change my day and just run around trying to take care of you. Because you got to fix that up yourself. That's your responsibility, but I can help some of it. you begin to realize that on the surface, love and codependency, look very much alike. But once you get deeper, you see different motivation. You see that the relationship is always out of balance as your needs versus their needs. And you begin to go, , codependency isn't healthy love. It's distorted love. Is that what you're getting at. , that makes a lot of sense. And I also wanted to swing back around too, because I forgot that I had another question for you. When we talk about narcissists, especially in society, today and online and everything that, it's almost there's this big blanket label that everybody wants to throw on it to a narcissist. And then they cast them out there over. And it's , don't touch them, stay away from them. They're evil people. They're the problem. Don't ever victim blame somebody that's with a narcissist. And the way that you're describing the dance back and forth, where we'll each take turns kind of, , in that spectrum of going from co-narcissist to narcissist, is the way that you're speaking about it, are you speaking about it as a narcissist.

All of those are designed for connection. What happens if a child can't connect in complex trauma. They don't get any of those chemicals. Rather they get cortisol or opioids. But cortisol and opioids create many of the feelings of oxytocin and serotonin and dopamine. if you look at drugs, they're dopamine. That's your crack and meth. They got opioids. They've got serotonin. That's your MDMA stuff. All of those things are part of that. And they release the chemicals that were designed to be released by connection. Problem is they don't last. They don't, they're not real, but yet they feel finally good. And that's why many people with the first time they actually use, they feel they're wrapped in a warm blanket. They feel even have an orgasm that just feels good. All of those chemicals are finally in the brain. The problem is the more you use the drugs, the more the brain tolerates that. And you get less and less delivered until you're not getting any of the chemicals anymore. You're just using the drugs. you don't go to even worse negative emotions. You're trying to cope. You're trying to get through a day, but you've given up getting any of the four good chemicals anymore. Another thing. Another thing. Another thing. Another thing. Another piece around that is cutting releases natural opioids. that's why when people cut, it actually feels good because it releases opioids in the body and it takes the pain away, the emotional pain away. And that becomes an addiction. all of those addiction things are actually solutions to not having any positive chemicals in my brain and not connecting because it makes me feel it. it can be a chemical.

The ability to feel without becoming overwhelmed. To remember without reliving. To move without freezing. That's where somatic therapy comes in. Body-based healing that doesn't just ask, What happened. But what does your body need to feel safe now. It might look breathwork, movement, grounding, or touch. It might mean learning how to notice sensations without judgment. How to stay present with discomfort instead of fleeing from it. How to feel your feet on the ground when your mind wants to run. These are not small steps. They are revolutionary acts of reclaiming your body from the grip of trauma. Because for many survivors, the body has not felt a safe place for a very long time. It was the scene of the crime. It carries the pain, the shame, the helplessness. And , understandably, many people disconnect from their bodies. They numb. They dissociate. They live from the neck up, trying not to feel too much. But healing asks us to come home to the body. Not all at once. Not forcefully. But gently, gradually, with curiosity and compassion. To feel the ground again. To breathe fully. To notice without judgment what is happening inside. This is not easy. In fact, for many, it's the hardest part. Feeling is hard when feeling has meant danger. But it is also where freedom lies. Because the only way out of trauma is through the body. When we work with trauma, we must remember that we are not just working with the past. We are working with the present-day survival responses that were once adaptive. The flinch. The freeze. The rage. The shutdown. These are not signs of a broken person. They are signs of a person who adapted to overwhelming conditions. But those adaptations, once life-saving, can become prisons. They can keep you stuck even when the danger is long gone. That's why we need to give the body new experience. Not just new thoughts. Experiences of safety. Of agency. Of connection. Experiences where the body learns, I don't have to brace anymore. I can relax.",

But if you're spending your time with abusers, while simultaneously checking in every few weeks with the abused woman, who keeps waking you up to reality, then you start to understand the abuser mentality. Because you start to understand what he's saying, what he's saying and thinking in his interactions with you versus what he's actually doing at home and what he's saying to her. And that was really the most important aspect of my background, was working intensively with the abusers while constantly hearing the story of what was actually, going on at home. And we'll be talking more, I'm sure, about some of the contrasts there. What led you, what even led you there to begin with. , I went through, I came out of college with various kinds of training and counseling. I didn't have a psychology degree, but I had various kinds of training and counseling. That was my only marketable skill. And, but my interests were always more in social change than in social work. I was trying to think, , how do you use counseling in a way that's more about social change than about social work. And I, first it didn't look I was going to find anything that. , oh, no one's going to pay you to counsel draft resistors or something. And when I learned about abuser programs, I thought, no, wait a minute, that's intriguing because that's really about trying to address a justice issue with your counseling skills and it ended up being a perfect fit. It's very cool to hear you say that. I mean, I feel I'm sitting here with you today because I hate patriarchy. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it with a deep passion. And I am an angry woman for that. And, but I wouldn't say I've kept it under wraps, but I'm not going to keep quiet about that anymore. And I feel the intersection in romantic relationships and patriarchy is unavoidable. It's almost impossible to engage with the idea of having one without considering the reality of the world we live in. it's interesting that you say what you're saying. And I'm curious, how many guys are doing what you're doing.",

Even if you in no way believe that you're stupid, it hurts when someone calls you stupid. The same way when someone's a jerk to you in traffic where it was totally their own fault It's still their fault.

Because the whole point of a relationship is it's supposed to do everything for me. That's the abuser's fundamental outlook on an intimate partner relationship. And in terms of the person on the receiving end of that, my sense is that many people are not always clear. The women have this challenge of trusting their perception of what is happening. We have a lot of people who watch our channel who have personality disorders. Their perceptions are either off or they understand that in the past they have been off and they cannot thus trust them. how do when to trust that what you're experiencing, if you're not actually getting a fist to your face or your body, is abuse versus just a messed up relationship. I don't think it's always easy, actually, to draw a real shot. I think it's a real sharp line. Now this has become abuse.

And I don't think that's entirely true. This is some place where I break from I think much of modern society, I think, , no, not all feelings are valid. for example, if I have a client, and I have had such a client, whose feelings are very hurt because while he was strangling his wife, she tried to kick him in the balls. , how could she try to do that to me. that's mean. She's going to, , hurt me in my private parts. No. They'll feel. his hurt feelings are not valid. He does not need someone saying, , , now he has his hurt feelings and she has his hurtlet's eachlet's all talk about her hurt feelings. He needs somebody to say to him, that's really messed up. That's an incredible distortion to have your feelings hurt because of her attempt to defend herself while you were strangling her. No, those are not valid feelings. Those are extreme distortions that are product of a really severe sense of entitlement and a really severe denial about the fact that you were putting her in ayou wereyou were. Doing a very serious, , felonious, , you belong in jail type of assault. We have to talk very bluntly.

In other words, being lined up, being harnessed with someone as a partner that is not going the same direction you are. Someone who's not of God. That's not a Christian idea. That's not something that God just tells people to do, to marry people who are not Christian. we had to wrestle with some of that. And it wasn't just a few years later that they were at total odds with each other and got divorced. I want to say they maybe were married 5 or 6 years, but it never worked.

The question marks in the diagnosis are more about recognizing the hyperactive type. If you look up at your life, do you feel sorry for these many decades without diagnosis. I definitely feel a little regret, because what some people are not aware of in relation to ADHS is that it is not the very big catastrophes, but rather the accumulation of many small moments, many small moments of failure in everyday life. And then also on such small things, which then make the damage that you cannot do it even greater.

The consequences are dramatic. that can already have serious consequences for the individual. We didn't recognize the disease and didn't treat it. Not to mention that ADHS often comes with side diseases, depressive disorders, especially anxiety disorders. Addiction diseases are to be mentioned here, but also physical diseases such as overweight and the resulting consequences, which can be prevented almost by all if the disease is diagnosed and treated early. Studies show that if you treat prisoners with ADHS, the rate of relapse decreases significantly. ADHS people need recognition, love, self-efficacy and success experiences everyone else. They often experience the opposite. Failure, shame, rejection and break-up. Half of them become depressed. We could improve a lot as a society if we just looked at it. Finally, we have it, we have it. Alexandra Philipsen knows that many parents also despair when they have to look at how their loved ones are running with them and their life. We in Germany love the question, who is to blame. Are the parents to blame. Definitely not. That's a big topic. also why it is probably stigmatized when a child shows ADHS symptoms, that the question quickly arises, are the parents to blame. Single father, single mother, are they too strict, are they too little strict. You can definitely say that ADHS is something that is very strongly genetically determined. Environmental factors can play a role, but it is clearly a family genetic component and no one is to blame. That's the way it is. You would never criticize anyone for their body size. We as a society give away much and many people suffer unnecessarily. In Germany, prisoners are only treated in individual cases on ADHS, also because excessive fears of drug trafficking are in the way.

Someone who's Machiavellianistic is too logical to get caught up in feelings of revenge, because under normal circumstances, revenge is not logical, it does not help people, and it won't advance the cause of somebody who's Machiavellianistic. Number four, the feeling of revenge comes when the narcissist perceives that they have been insulted. Often the insult is related to something the narcissist has heard before. a common theme, a challenge to their authority, a commentary on their lack of ability, or the denial of a romantic relationship, a rejection by a potential romantic partner. This is by far the most studied. This is the most studied. This is the most studied aspect of this part of vindictive narcissism, in terms of what precipitates the feeling of revenge. What is the insult. the vindictive narcissist cannot accept any criticism, no matter how logical it is, accurate it is, or how gently the criticism was delivered. No criticism or advice can be received. Nothing can be said to create positive change. They struggle to grow or develop. They have difficulty learning, especially about their own behavior. They are trapped in a prison of narcissism, but their goal is not to escape, but to imprison other people as. it's not about escaping narcissism. It's not about failing to be narcissistic anymore. It's about dragging other people down into that misery that they experience. Moving on to number five, their plans to get revenge are sloppy, childlike, and simplistic, much the schoolyard bully. They are motivated by their own self-interest. They are motivated by resentment and jealousy. The perceived insult or injury is intolerable to them. People simply don't have the to insult them or to doubt that they are perfect. Sometimes an extreme manifestation of their revenge is thought of as a narcissistic rage. We see this term sometimes when studying narcissism, kind of an extreme angry reaction when they are starting to get revenge. The intent is not to punish somebody that they can live. It's not to teach somebody how to live. It's not to teach somebody how to learn something, but rather to make another person suffer.

And can lead them to feel estranged and isolated from their siblings and other family members who absolutely are not happy about how the golden child is receiving such special treatment. Now, these golden children in a childhood and even adulthood may try to distance from the narcissistic parent. That, interestingly, gets quite tricky, because then the narcissistic parent will treat the golden child with the same rage that they would anyone who abandons them or doesn't validate them. Into adulthood, these golden children may end up quite anxious, a bit grossed out by being affiliated with the narcissistic parent, and may try to spend their lives trying to make amends for what happened. And they may even end up in a very difficult situation because they don't know what happened during childhood. There may be a lot of guilt because they can see what the narcissistic parent's treatment did to their other siblings, especially to any siblings that might have been in the role of a scapegoat. And for the golden child, that can actually result in feelings of shame and self-devaluation. In life, while it seems it could always be rosy and sad, it may not always be. And finally, there is another potential downside in terms of what happens to the golden child. They may end up feeling more stuck and obligated in terms of needing to manage the narcissistic parent as they go into adulthood and older age. This can end up being a bit of a black or white thing. The entitled, the golden child may just foist it onto the scapegoat, the responsibilities of taking care of this aging narcissistic parent, and just no longer deal with the narcissistic parent when they are no longer useful to them. And that unfortunate scapegoated child, now scapegoated adult, still has to hear the narcissistic parent singing the praises of the golden child, even though the scapegoat has to deal with the mess of managing the narcissistic parent.

And all of these may, and they may also, the parents may help the child become a great student or succeed in other ways that will benefit the golden child practically, at least when they become an adult. The balancing act then becomes to have a -formed sense of self, but to keep it realistic, not be grandiose, and not buckle under the guilt if siblings were involved. And that alignment of the planets is pretty damn rare. Sometimes, rarely, but sometimes golden children may get the last laugh. They achieve what I call the gold standard of golden children. They would be, the golden child is raised a thoroughbred with every resource poured into them. And then may actually succeed. And may then understand the toxicity of their narcissistic parent. And then may actually succeed. And then may actually succeed. And may use their success to also be there for their siblings and support and foster them. Now, that's a lot of thens, a lot of maybes, and a lot of conditions. But it's possible, in some cases, it could happen.",

    "text": "Because basically at that point, you're kind of calling them out as a bit of a rotten, abusive person. And that inflames the whole shame, rage spiral. At their deepest core, narcissistic people know that they're not nice people. And when that primal stuff gets stirred up, their claws come out. Trying to make it about being a joke, frankly, is gaslighting. And it puts them in the victim position of being oh misunderstood. You didn't understand my joke. The structural reason for this is because every narcissist has both the grandiose and the vulnerable elements encompassed with them. They're grandiose when stuff's going ,. But when the grandiose stuff isn't working, stuff in their life isn't going their way, or they get called out, or they experience something that activates their shame, for example, someone calling them out on their behavior, then the vulnerable narcissist comes out to play. And then the victimhood descends. The victim bully sequence confuses people. But once you recognize it as a strategy or a tactic by the narcissist, it makes more sense than seeing it as the narcissist being two different people. They are, in fact, one person, one very tactical, manipulative person. Over time, this victim bully thing has worked for them. Don't get me wrong. When they are hurt, and for them hurt means ego injury, not necessarily hurt feelings per se. But when something happens, something that makes them not look good to other people, or they feel that they aren't being adequately appreciated. It doesn't feel good for them. And that's when they slide immediately into the victimized, whoa, is me. That part in and of itself isn't that interesting. Many of us, even non-narcissists can pretty easily fall into a victimized space when people are calling us out. The difference is that the narcissistic people have the bully piece alongside the victim piece. the juxtaposition of the two is what is striking. And that's why I'm here. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Goodbye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.",

    "text": "It makes it a lot easier to try to not get in there and appease them. And remember, the narcissist isn't two people. They are just one -oiled manipulation machine. Let's take on this issue of devaluing and discarding. The classical narcissistic fairy tale starts with idealization and then moves on to devaluation and then discarding. Everyone thinks it won't happen to them. And yet, without exception, the story goes down the same way every time. To feel thrown away by another person is an awful experience, but yet it is sort of a universal part of the narcissistic relationship. let's start by taking a look at the narcissistic relationship cycle. In most cases, not all, not all by any means, but many of most, the idealization often takes the form of love bombing. Which is another video in this series. love bombing or idealization lasts just long enough to get you stuck in this relationship dynamic. Just when you exhale and believe in the fairy tale, then bam, that's when the devaluation phase starts. Devaluation can start slow. It's when the little criticisms begin, when you start experiencing the contempt. When the gifts and the big nights out go away. When the narcissist's phone becomes much more interesting than you sitting in front of them. And when the sideways comments , I don't know, , are you really going to wear that. And other comments of that ilk start to creep into the relationship. It can be a real time of intense confusion in a relationship because you can't figure out what's going on. You can't figure out what's going on. You can't figure out what's going on. You just have to figure out when the love bombing ended and when the contempt began. All is it's though the weather changed. It went from being very warm to very cold, kind of quickly. The devaluing phase tends to happen just as you start to feel more settled into the relationship as a real relationship. You may have actually been resisting the relationship for a while. might have even have been savvy enough to think, oh, this love bombing is a little bit too good to be true. I'm not going to be played. And then just when you settled in, when you felt it was a real and whole relationship, that is when the devaluation begins.",

    "text": "And you can finally walk away. It's interesting to think that in a discard and a devalue cycle, that you could actually get that kind of power. You often feel you're stuck at the whims of the narcissist when they will devalue you, when they will discard you. Whether that's a partner, family member, or even a boss. But the fact of the matter is, ultimately, believe it or not, in these cycles, you have a lot more power than you think in the form of self-compassion. Self-compassion not only allows you to say, , no, I'm not doing this cycle. I see what it is. It's not good for me. And allow you to step away. But self-compassion also allows you to feel compassion for the other. And as difficult and challenging as these narcissistic relationships are, as I said, many times narcissistic individuals have had very difficult backstories. In fact, it's what explains a lot of their personality and why it's organized the way it is. There is no need for you to engage in those kinds of toxic cycles. You don't have to devalue and discard. From a place of self-compassion, you can also let them go from a place of compassion. And in your heart, hope that maybe they can go and get the help they need to grow into a healthier future. However, that's not your job. Self-preservation is a. And if you're going to preserve yourself in these cycles, you've got to exercise that and break the devaluation and discard cycle. Thank you again for tuning in. I hope this video helped you understand the theme, the terms, devaluation, and more importantly, the process of self-discarding, which are very much a part of the narcissistic relationship cycle.

How dare you. How dare you not show up when I demanded you to. How dare you don't listen to me. How dare you not be available to me. How dare you think you can be your own person separate from me. How dare you deviate from this family's narrative. How dare you don't remain in my service. How dare you think you can be out of my control.

And folks, as too , this is not an easy cycle to break. And parents are kryptonite. You may actually be functioning in other areas of your life work and friends, but then having to see that parent again can lead you to feel that subjugated and scared child again. And that parent is not going to change. for some folks, no contact or avoiding contact is the only path forward. Even in the article, there were parents interviewed who felt, oh, sad. About how much of their adult children's lives that they were missing. Graduations and weddings and grandkids and a small acknowledgement , , I was an alcoholic and , I screamed a lot and made the house a scary place. But that was then. Can't they see that I'm trying. It's not a child's job to see that you're trying. Whether that child is a child or an adult, that parent has to recognize that we get, one chance at childhood and the harms that are done at that time. , to some degree are fixable. Those fixes aren't easy. And even with the fixes, those wounds don't ever go fully away. the adult parents still makes it about themselves. Oh, I'm missing out on much. And sure, I did a few bad things rather than my behavior must have been terrifying for a child and it wasn't. Making amends doesn't mean the other person has to be. The person has to accept them. And even the most skilled apology does not carry with it. The requirement that the other person has to take it and clean the slate. Perhaps the only way to move forward is to recognize the slate will forever remain messy. And then backing that up with radical acceptance. All of that means that your parent likely will always remain locked into these patterns. Choose accordingly. Many people who are estranged struggle until the end of their parents' lives and beyond. Should I have gone to visit.",

    "text": "our relationship with a narcissist is a lot buying a house with a foundation problem. On the surface, everything looks solid, but the longer you stay, the shakier it becomes. in this video, I'm going to walk you through nine signs of covert narcissism that don't really look narcissistic at all on the surface. you can see the foundation problem for what it is before it all starts to crack beneath you. My name is Christina and I help people make sense of the chaos narcissists leave behind they can stop second guessing themselves and finally move on. And if you're still not sure about what's keeping you stuck, I created a free quiz that can help. It's designed to show you exactly where you are in the recovery process and what to focus on next. You'll find a link for that in the description. let's start with the first sign because it's one that usually flies under the radar. And by the time you recognize it, it's already started to chip away at your sense of reality. They downplay things that hurt you. maybe you bring something up and it's something small, but , it's stuck with you. And instead of owning it or hearing you out, they naturally brush it off. They might say you're being dramatic or that's not what I meant. And sometimes you get the full out gaslighting. That's you're not actually upset. You're just trying to make me feel bad. somehow through all of this, they become the authority on your feelings. I don't know how that works, but somehow for them, it does. But through all of it, it doesn't sound angry. It sounds, it's calm. they're just setting the record straight. And the dangerous part is then you find yourself backpedaling. maybe you're explaining your tone or justifying your reaction. You're trying to prove that, yes, you really were hurt, even if it seems it wasn't a big deal. And this is where the shift starts, because now you're not talking about what they did. Instead, there's a group effort managing how much pain you're allowed to feel. And there you are working overtime to sound reasonable they don't flip it back on you. And in the middle of all of this, you're trying to prove that you're not hurt. And you're trying to you're trying to prove that you're not hurt.",

But over time, you start feeling you're walking through a space that's delicate. Not because anything's shattered just yet, but because the damage keeps showing up in the same spot. now you're moving differently. Not because you're fragile, but because the relationship is. You're watching your step, trying not to press too hard or speak too loudly. We're definitely trying not to need too much. Because you've been here before. You're not going to be there. You're not going to be there. You're not going to be there. And the last time you spoke up, they turned it around on you. And that's the crack in the foundation. It's not the disagreement itself, but the way they rewrite it to make you feel you're the problem. And the longer you stay, the more normal that starts to feel. maybe you are overreacting. Or maybe this is just what relationships feel when you're hard to love. But it's not. And you're not hard to love. They just made you feel that way. All of this is just a show. And it's a quiet erosion of your self-worth. another sign of covert narcissism that doesn't seem narcissistic on the surface is they turn your pain into theirs. maybe you're finally honest about something that hurt. You're not blaming them. You're just trying to be real about how something landed with you. And instead of hearing you, they go quiet. Or they get withdrawn. Or they act kind of wounded. you just said something really unfair. And then suddenly, the conversation isn't about what happened. It's about how bad you made them feel. they might say something , I guess I can't do anything. Or I'm the worst partner in the world, aren't I. And now here you are comforting them for something they did to you. It's subtle. And it doesn't always come with name calling. It just kind of flips the emotional weight onto your side of the scale. they're the ones who've been hurt the most in this interaction. And now they have to focus on you.

    "text": "you backpedal and you soften your words. And the next time you might not bring it up at all. Because somewhere along the way, the safest move became silence. And that's another shift in the foundation. It's not just that cracks are forming. It's that you're starting to walk around them. you start arranging your words, your tone, and even your emotions around their sense of purpose. It's about sensitivity. But the truth is it's not real vulnerability. It's emotional deflection. Because instead of sitting with the impact of what they did, they make your pain about them. And the damage that does is not loud or explosive, but it keeps you from ever really being seen. And that makes the entire relationship feel off balance, even when everything on the surface still looks fine. another sign of covert narcissism that does not look super narcissistic on the surface, is that we are being a bit too open and we're kind of talking about what you're doing. surface is they help you in ways that actually leave you off balance. maybe they do something for you without being asked. Maybe they fix something or offer a solution, or they swoop in just at the moment to take care of it for you. And on the surface, it looks thoughtful. You should feel supported, but instead you kind of feel displaced. imagine somebody rearranged your kitchen while you were out, and now you're supposed to be grateful that they saved you from this mess that you didn't actually have. And now you have no idea where anything is and everything feels chaos. But at the same time, you're supposed to thank them. And if you don't thank them, if you don't respond in the way they expect, suddenly you become ungrateful or difficult or impossible to help. next time you smile and you play along and you tell yourself it's fine. Maybe they were just trying. But deep down, something has shifted because the message wasn't, I've got your back. It was you needed. Me to step in. And that's what slowly breaks your trust in yourself. Because now every time you try to take the lead, they're already one step ahead, offering a fix you didn't ask for and making sure how much easier they made your life.

You're living in the room of support and constantly rearranging your comfort just to keep the peace. another sign of covert narcissism that is not obvious upfront is when they quietly withhold warmth. maybe you push back on something or you disappoint them in a way that wasn't even intentional and they don't blow up. They don't even argue. They just kind of drop out. the tone changes and the energy is completely different and you feel it. haven't said a word.

And before it, you're softening your tone. You're checking your words. You're working to bring the warmth back in, even though you're not the one who turned it off.

And you keep blaming yourself for the cold. another sign of covert narcissism that's not obvious in a relationship is they make you feel that the issue is how you said something. maybe you bring something up calmly and clearly. You've probably rehearsed it in your head to make sure it's fair and reasonable, probably a million times over. And somehow it still doesn't land. they act confused or they say you're being too intense or they pick apart your tone or wording instead of explaining it.

you're doubting how you're saying it you'll never get to why it needed to be said in the first place another sign of covert narcissism that shows up in a relationship but is not always obvious is they forget things that don't benefit them maybe you circle back to a conversation you had something they said or something they promised maybe something that really mattered to you and they act it never happened naturally you'll get the i don't remember saying that you must be thinking of something else or that's not what i meant and now you're not just hurt you're defending your memory and you're finding yourself digging through old texts and reading messages trying to find proof that you're not making this up because you're not but the more they deny the more you start to wonder if maybe you misunderstood or maybe you just wanted to hear something they never actually said and this is how it works they don't erase the story just the parts that hold them accountable and every time they do they repaint over the same wall the crack was never there in the first place you imagined it and the fact that you keep trying to prove what actually happened is not about clarity that's survival

narcissist is warm in public but cold in private when other people are around they're charming thoughtful engaged and they smile when they talk to you maybe they make jokes they touch your shoulder you're close and to everyone else it looks you're lucky it looks the relationship is solid but then you get home and everything shifts then they're quiet or distant or they're just not interested and it's not just one bad day and it's not necessarily that there's even a reason it's that there's warmth when people are watching and coldness when they're not interested it's not about being a bad person it's about the fact that you're a good person and that you're a good person and that you're good for someone else you're a good person and that's why i'm sure that you have to be a good person because you're a good person they're not and that split starts to wear on you because when the house looks pristine from the outside no one would imagine that the basement floods every time it rains you start wondering if maybe you're the problem maybe you're expecting too much but you're not you're just noticing the gap and that's the danger of this kind of covert behavior it doesn't just make you feel unseen it makes you feel crazy for seeing what no one else can another sign that covert narcissism is present that is not super obvious is that you're always tired but there's no obvious reason maybe nothing huge has happened you haven't had some explosive fight you may haven't said anything that's outright cruel but you're tired and you can't quite explain why not tired you need a nap tired your brain doesn't stop scanning for what mood they're in tired you're constantly trying to say the things in the way it doesn't set something off even though half the time you don't even know what that something is and maybe people around you wouldn't get it because everything looks fine you're still functioning the relationship looks normal but you don't feel normal you feel off on edge kind of you're walking around with a low battery all the time and you don't even remember when it started draining and here's the thing there's no big collapse there's no breaking point no emergency per se but that doesn't mean there's no damage because now you're constantly maintaining things that shouldn't need maintaining you're keeping the peace you're filling in the emotional gaps explaining things to yourself that don't actually make sense just you can stay upright in a space that never really lets you rest it's the house is still standing but only because you're running around with duct tape and drywall mud trying to keep the place livable and you don't even know when that became your job you just know that's not what you're doing and that's why you're not keeping things that are important to you now you're not keeping things that are important to you now you're not keeping things that are important to you now you're not keeping things that are important to you now you're not keeping things that are important to you now you're tired and the worst part is you've started to think that's just what love is supposed to feel tired and the worst part is you've started to think that's just what love is supposed to feel another sign of covert narcissism that is not obviously narcissistic on the surface is that they tell you what they want to hear but they never follow through maybe they say exactly what you've been wanting to hear that they're going to change that they finally understand how much this has affected you or that things will be different and in the moment it feels real you can finally exhale but then time passes and nothing happens, or the story changes, or maybe they act you misunderstood what they meant.",

And now you're stuck between what they said and what they're doing, between what you felt and what they're pretending never happened. This is future faking. It's giving you just enough hope to keep you emotionally invested, but never enough follow through to actually build anything real. to bring it back to the house analogy, it's they sketch out this beautiful renovation,. And they promised the upgrades, the lighting in this space. But when it's time to show up and start the work, they disappear. And you're left in the same old house holding blueprints that were never meant to be followed. And maybe the hardest part is you weren't asking for fantasies. You just wanted something solid and something honest. But when someone keeps promising a future they have no intention of creating. What they're really doing is buying time. While you keep living in a house that was never going to be finished. maybe it didn't look toxic at first. Maybe there were no screaming matches, no obvious threats. Maybe there were just quiet shifts, confusing moments and little betrayals that didn't feel betrayals at the time. And that's exactly why covert narcissism is hard to see, because the damage doesn't hit all at once. It builds slowly. Underneath the surface. Until one day you realize you're exhausted, doubting yourself, and living in something that doesn't feel safe anymore. And if any part of you is still trying to explain it away, if you're still questioning whether it really counts as betrayal, watch this video next.

But if you don't feel any disturbance, you can actually use this exercise to call up some disturbance. Maybe the image of a person that you're struggling with in relationship now, maybe an interaction. Maybe you're feeling a sensation that didn't go very and it's kind of stuck in your system, it just doesn't feel very good. And this is normally the exact kind of experience sensation that we avoid. We try to shove it down, we repress it, we distract ourselves. And we're doing something counter instinctual here by going into it, going into the heart of the sensation. you call up a disturbing encounter. Something someone said to you, something they did, something that happened in life that left you feeling unsteady, unmoored, anxious, disturbed. And as you continue to breathe, you can notice where this shows up in the body. Where is the disturbance. Where is the intense sensation that you would prefer. You prefer not to be feeling, but nevertheless, it's present in your system. And rather than running, evading, distracting, repressing, can you just relax into it.

Had that person been doing what they were supposed to be doing, I wouldn't be feeling this. But in fact, we are feeling this now. it's an opportunity to actually really commit to our feelings. To our embodied experience. Letting go of the story. Even something as simple as an emotional interpretation. Letting go of even emotion and going to the raw sensation. And if it helps, you can use a word or two to describe whatever physical sensation you're aware of in the body. For me, with my disturbance in this body, I'm not feeling anything. With my disturbance in this moment, I'm aware of a clenching, a contraction in the throat. A pressure. I feel some ache in my heart. see if you can do that. Just physical sensation. No emotion, no story. Just a little bit of that. And it's important when we do this exercise to ask ourselves, Is the signal I'm getting from my body indicating real danger. In this moment, there might actually be something unsafe. And you want to ask yourself that. Is this signal from the body, this intensity, this disturbance, Is it signaling that something about the environment is unsafe. And if it is, we want to take care of ourselves. And change our circumstances as best we can. But if it's a disturbance that's not indicative of any immediate danger, If we actually feel safe, that is, on an objective level, We can use this opportunity to go even deeper.

    "text": "And a lot of what we know about burnout has come from that research on occupational burnout specifically, but throughout recent years, maybe the last five to 10 years or people are starting to look at burnout in these other arenas. particularly parental or caregiver burnout, we're starting to see some research being done there. And I wouldn't be surprised if even more research comes out in different arenas since the pandemic, because that highlighted a lot of different types of stress for all of us essentially. But when you think about what burnout really represents, and that is if you think of the actual WHO definition, which they define it as a syndrome of chronic stress that hasn't been successfully managed. if you think of it just in a basic form that, then you can see how easily you could extrapolate it to a number of your life scenarios. to speak. that's kind of the definition of burnout that's accepted now, again, originally started with workplace, but I think as we talk about it more, a lot of people listening will think, Oh, , , I feel that too. And not necessarily at work, or maybe in my, in my personal life, too. it's really composed of these three main components. And the first is emotional exhaustion. I think of that as the feeling of, it's kind of kind of makes sense. It's just, you feel I'm spent, I am completely maxed out. my light is dim now that I can barely see it that kind of, I to use the term soul sucked, you feel you are something is just totally sucking your soul. That's that feeling of emotional burnout, you have nothing left to give. And then the second part of it, their second component is this depersonalization. And I think of that really is just a disconnection, you're disengaged from what your main roles are your primary job is. Maybe you don't feel personally invested in what you're doing anymore, even though you once did. And this shows up a lot, at least for me, it did. But for a lot of people as just you're just going through the motions, you're checking the boxes that need to be checked. And maybe you're even just showing up for the paycheck, honestly. But it's an attitude of, , I'm just done with this place.",

And then you're just , oh, , They're part of the team technically, but they don't really even want to be anymore. This is the component that I think any manager or boss would just not want to hear from his or her employees, that disengagement. then the third one is this reduced personal accomplishment. that feeling that no matter what you do, you are not affecting any change. you're busting your butt, but you feel nothing's changing, nothing's improving. I used to use the term when I was during COVID and in my leadership role, I would say to my husband, I feel I'm just banging my head against the wall. I'm saying the same stuff over and over again, and it feels nobody's listening. again, those are kind of the main three accepted components of burnout. emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and then that feeling of decreased personal accomplishment or effectiveness. , that's interesting. I'm already learning much. I'm really not an expert in burnout. I have my own theories and approaches. I'm not an expert in burnout. I'm not an expert in burnout. I'm not an expert in burnout. I'm not an expert in burnout. I'm not an expert in burnout. But as you talk about that, that makes a lot of sense. And that third one, I think there's a lot of overlap between trauma and depression and burnout. And that third one, where you start to feel , why try. What's the point. I keep putting effort in, and I'm not seeing any outcome. Or if you do see an outcome, maybe it doesn't even feel good. You have some big success, and you're , cool, whatever.

But again, I bring that up to say that those can be your signs of burnout if you're starting to see those things. Totally. One of the first things I noticed when I start to get stressed is I'm , I'm going to go to the bathroom and I'm going to go to the bathroom and I'm going to go to the bathroom and I'm going to go to the bathroom and I'm going to go to the bathroom. I change my eating. And I just started learning about how the cortisol release actually triggers, correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm not a doctor, insulin. It triggers insulin. your body can mobilize blood sugar, which makes your blood sugar drop, which makes you crave more sugar, which makes you get on this rollercoaster of blood sugar, basically. Is that. , that's basically. And that's why, , these chronic states of high cortisol can lead to weight gain, diabetes, exactly metabolic syndrome. And it's interesting. This is kind of a side comment, but when you think about people who work night shifts or parents who are up all night with their kids, their little kids, and then your sleep gets all messed up and your cortisol levels are fluctuating in a very different way than if you're on a normal day night schedule. then you start to realize , wow, why am I , I'm hungry all day. I just want to eat all day, just to get a little bit of energy or something. , exactly. And you start craving different things and you're wanting sugar and more sugar.

I know. , sounds exhausting. I mean, I'm just tired, just managing my kids, but I don't work nights. And I think, , the other thing, I just find all this stuff really interesting, but the circadian rhythm has a direct interaction with your cortisol level. there's this cortisol awakening response that comes usually in the mornings, but if you're working night shift, it's going to be five, your body's just boink, boink, boink, all over the place. Exactly. It just adds another additional component to all of this. Yes. Seriously, seriously. , ,. people who are experiencing burnout, they're going to see a lot of stuff going on in their bodies and you just described , , more liability, more irritability, maybe more cravings, maybe more unhealthy coping strategies. And I would imagine also people feeling tired, emotionally tired or physically tired or having a hard time sleeping or sleeping too much.

Would you consider your response as you described doing that. I'm just curious. Would you describe that as kind of white knuckling it. Or gritting your way through it. Or would you describe that as regulating your way through it. Or is it a little bit of both within the situation. Truly, I think it's regulating. But again, I think that takes time and it's a learned response. Probably in the beginning, it was more white knuckling and trying to get through it and just trying to tell yourself, just be focused, just be focused. compartmentalize. Put that in a box and put it into the storeroom with more boxes. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. And over time, I think it is more self-regulating. And again, it just comes with practice. Now, there's definitely still some compartmentalizing that goes on because there's a lot of emotion that comes with those types of cases, of course. But I think that speaks, again, as I said it out loud, I think, , that really speaks to the practice of it because it changes over a career, over years of having to be in that situation. And, , it seems very more regulated to me now than it does to be just a grin and bear it type of reaction. More of a controlled response, if that makes sense, as opposed to a reaction. I really appreciate you taking , , exploring that because I think there are a lot of people who can get through stressful situations, but not in a sustainable way. And what you're describing is a sustainable approach to regulating your body in the middle of a stressful situation. You're not escaping the situation and you're not avoiding it in your mind. You're not just stuffing and suppressing those emotions. You're regulating through those emotions. And of course, with these big situations, you've got to unpack them sometimes later.",

In response, I might feel a flood of emotions. defensiveness. I do not. Indignation. Oh, you're not good yourself. You're always talking about yourself. Or immense shame. I'm not good enough. I'm such a bad friend. I suck at relationships. With a delayed prefrontal cortex, emotions hit fast and hard. It's hard to slow yourself down.

And they feel they're not going to be able to do anything about how they feel. And they feel they're not going to be able to do anything about change the past. But here's the thing.

When you ruminate on your mistakes over and over, you can really hurt yourself and then feel depressed or hopeless or , why bother. Why try.

This frustration is a proof of the existence of a will to meaning. Unless we were imbued by will to meaning, by the wish to find meaning and discover and fulfill meaning in life. We never would be able to experience an inner void. this is in a way also something positive. Now you've listed three types of values, creative values, experiential values, and attitudinal values. And you may find a meaning, the average man, the man on the street or the woman on the street, may find a meaning day by day in doing a deed, in creating a work. And. That's the creative. Creative. And. In experiencing something, the beauty, the truth as a researcher, or the good in dealing with people as a teacher or whatsoever. There's an extraordinary moment in Man's Search for Meaning where you talk about being in one of the Nazi camps and all of you going out to look at a sunset. Is that experiential. Exactly. This is a paradigm of experiential values, of finding a meaning in experiencing without doing anything, without achieving or accomplishing anything, but just in giving oneself to the immediate experience of something, say, beautiful going on in the world. This is the second avenue. But there is also another aspect of experiential values. Excuse me. Not only experiencing something. But also experiencing someone. More than that. Experiencing another human being in his or her very uniqueness. And it is the main attribute of a human being that he is a person in contrast to any animal. He is a person.",

Now, I'm convinced that in contrast to the usual aspect, albeit sound aspect to life, and more specifically to the past, to life's transitoriness, and this includes that we approach, each of us are approaching death. In contrast to that, I maintain that in the past, nothing is lost, but on the contrary, everything is stored forever. It is not annihilated by transitoriness, but on the contrary, it has been, it is becoming preserved forever. Something you have done can never be undone. Something you have experienced, something you have even experienced in a negative sense, going through suffering, and if you have, for instance, if you have suffered, gone through this suffering, honestly, courageously, and with dignity, who in the world, what in the world can deny, can annihilate this. What you have done has been done forever, in both ways, in a negative as in a positive way. It cannot be undone. And the past is a storehouse of what you have done. What you have done, what you have experienced, what you have gone through, and what you have done out of all the negative and tragic aspects as even encountered within your life.

want to relate to another person at a deeper level and be known at that deeper level it's it's very disappointing very demoralizing to have someone come back with that attitude of not having really any curiosity about anything in depth and they jump to a conclusion really fast and it's very hard to communicate with people that part about jumping to a conclusion too with parenting it's you are just a demanding child or you're you're the way that there can be a very simplistic oh i know that i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to answer that question but i think it's i'm this way i want deep connection with people and i have family members who let's say not to call anyone out on the podcast but let's say one of my caregivers is really a lot you're describing just this sort of lack of their caring but they have a lack of really understanding about anyone else's inner world they'll say things do you think that people just get depressed i don't know i don't think people are depressed they're just depressed and they can't not feel that way and it's yes i mean of course it can change but i do believe that's real that people can feel that way and then they'll say i don't know i guess i just have had a really good life i just don't understand that and then i know objectively that their life really wasn't all that good growing up it's it's more a fixable function for us to process and i know that would be for best and worst of both fighters question number two what are the goes until you're sadly clouds can make yourself unhappy because they bring up light and oh i'm anxious or you want to know and see what happens and all the arts are going off and on go after yourself and the somewhat fluid way of doing things or the old the old way of thinking about things and that's good but i think one of the great things that you learn is that you it's your mind has to be open let's blood do the most useful when we say the most useful thing and more i'm telling this is the flow hinears upon each other that's an interesting thinking thing i think but i don't think if i have toãåéƒ excited because then all the people who have a lot of superficial i just don't think about it i move on i there is no reflective depth there's no there's no shadowing there's no perspective it's it's just things are very much on the surface and of course if you see the world that way it's really easy to make snap decisions and to see things in black and white and wrong good and bad which is a nightmare when you're a child and your parent is sizing you up that these very extreme categories based on whether or not they what you're doing that's that's hard on the self-esteem it was and if you if you see the way i look at it is in order to be a whole person we really are equipped and made to use both our and left hemispheres of our brain we need some problem solving we need some categorizing abstract sequential thought we need to be analytical that's all great but we need our depth man we really need to be able to have intuition have imagination feel our way into situations have an instinct about something have a that's just deeper than what my social role is ideally i mean i mean they've done much research on brain functioning and what happens when people have injuries to one side or the other the brain and it's kind of been proven that if you're not using a part of your brain enough you're really missing out on the full the full experience of being a human being who can be in relationship with other people i mean it's a big to me it's a big deal it isn't just that these people are kind of difficult or they're a little bit frustrating it's a whole thing about how their mind and how their brain works or doesn't work and that's probably related to some kind of trauma having to do with attachment or security and that all has to come from the hemisphere of the brain i mean babies and mothers relate to each other through hemisphere resonance or kind of that attunement but if you have problems with that early in life and maybe that mother isn't or that mothering person i should say maybe that person isn't sensitive and maybe they aren't attuned over time that child might learn oh the side of my brain is not a safe place for me to hang out because i go into all these feelings and i get these intuitions and i and people look at me i have two heads maybe it just would be better if i became them and stayed over here in the left hemisphere more be very logical be very categorized black and white that i mean i think that's that's a that's a very important thing to be able to do and it's not a big deal to be able to do that because it's not a big deal to be able to do that but it's a big deal to be able to do that it to me it's it's a very big deal because it means when you're emotionally immature that you're not using the full complement of what your brain is designed to do which is to use both sides and both types of abilities yes i i really see what you mean and i and i'll say for myself with my parents and i was a very emotional person and i was very emotional and sensitive i had a lot of stress and i was very emotional and sensitive and i was very emotional and sensitive for me there was i think i was very emotional and sensitive and then became very kind of locked down and disconnected from my emotions as a way to cope and then it was a very difficult process to come back to feeling my emotions but when because i even noticed how in my marriage i would be when taking care of little kids and working and all the things can just become very transactional it's oh who's picking up this and what's for dinner and how are we do we need to go the grocery store and just sort of passing but without that i'm not a very emotional person i'm not a very emotional person and i don't have a lot of time but it's special to what we do and why we do it at home and that's what makes really helping that make that veryapa

beautiful way even though there's a lot of pain but there's also joy and happiness and sadness and fear and anger and all the feelings it just feels much more alive to be that way it is i mean it is much more alive because you're using everything in yourself which was designed to be used it was designed to be experienced not only because it's nice and not only because these feelings are wonderful and meaningful there's that's a big word with this i think that the meaning comes from all these values and abilities of the hemisphere we it feels meaningful to us and if you don't have that then you begin to lose your sense of basic meaning in life and then that leads into a particular kind of depression that is i mean it's very hard to come back from that if you get too far away from those more internal gifts that we all have i appreciate the way you described the characteristics of someone who is emotionally immature and i hear and we've talked about not only today but in our previous interview too how it can change it's not a fixed state of being someone who is emotionally immature can change that can change for them if they have self-reflection when people ask me can they change or will they change yes if they are capable of self-reflecting or something happens in their life that sort of makes them self-reflect because it's they can't get out of that box that they're in they're not just going to say i want to become curious about myself it has to be something it might it might be external it might come in with the spouse saying they're leaving or they might end up on the wrong side of the law or whatever and some judge says you need to be in treatment i mean there are ways that they get to being self-reflective but i just wanted to mention that because that's such an important criterion for whether or not a person will change yes they have to see that there's something missing to want to make a change exactly otherwise why would you especially if you already think everything's you're doing is and it's the other people that are the problem exactly in relationship and i won't go into this part too much because i feel it's interesting how even though i have a parent who's that and my other parent is different i'm i didn't i had an interruption in my emotional development and then was able to work with it because something didn't feel satisfying to me i guess there was enough of the budding self-awareness that was coming to the surface for me to catch that but it's it's hard when you have that upbringing and then your siblings might be the same way as the parent was or that's just not the case for me i think it's it's hard to be that and then that's a way that they've all adapted to the way the parent was it can make it really hard to have close sibling relationships close friendships and i guess you don't have to choose to be friends with people who aren't interested in deep connection but your siblings are they're already there they're you didn't really get to choose them it can be really hard to be in relationship with people who are functioning in that way and don't see anything wrong with it and it's you mentioned early in our discussion today it can feel we can gaslight ourselves what am i doing wrong with this person i'm trying to let them know what i need in this relationship or how what's not working for me and they're just why are you talking to me that's where i feel your book here is beneficial this particular newest book and how to disentangle from people who are emotionally immature because it's you try to figure out how to set a boundary or what to say and the person just kind of doesn't it doesn't seem to register they either ignore it what i said to you before we started recording was they just kind of override what you said disregard it and then for me when that has happened i'm what's what am i getting wrong here what why can't i understand boundaries why can't i set boundaries it's really that it makes it kind of brings that child part back for me where i'm oh i'm lost i have no idea what to do now i tried something it's not getting me anywhere can you talk a little bit about that this this is a topic that's really near and dear to my heart because i think that again if you're just looking at it from a standpoint of sort of cognitive or cognitive behavioral approaches to situations this it would be set the boundary tell them it's taken care of but that's a sound that's what they say set a boundary set that boundary and then my problem will be solved the problem is that the other person doesn't hear it or they don't respond to it and you set the boundary and they go on you haven't said anything or they say oh don't be ridiculous or they dismiss they dismiss it in some way i didn't do that he didn't do that he didn't mean that i didn't mean that they dismiss it and they distort what happened because they're really not interested in learning about how it felt to you or why you would want to set this boundary that is not interesting to them they don't get it when people are given that message that you just need to set the boundary i think they also need to be given the message that you may end up feeling very frustrated you can't make yourself heard you can't make yourself understood sprinkleÐ½Ð¾ to their own Flame peace and means no i could recognize the loneliness moment when we talk about setting boundaries, you can get people ready for that by doing imagined encounters where they, , talk to an imaginary person or it could be their boss, it could be a parent, but they get some practice in actually saying things to them that are setting boundaries.",

They don't normally recognize how Codependency is a subconscious program that your mind is literally built before the age of seven to behave a certain way and to React to certain situations and certain triggers a certain way We don't usually consider how being codependent is tied to our childhoods. What did you observe in childhood. What kind of mom did you have did you have a mom who is a people pleaser. Did you have a dad who was highly narcissistic or vice versa. Did you grow up with parents who were not emotionally regulated. Did you grow up feeling invisible. Did you grow up feeling not good enough. Did you grow up in this paradigm that. Made you feel you were sub subordinate to other people that you didn't have a to a self Now when you grow up in this type of a situation, you're not anchored to the self You don't become self actualized. You don't become self Individualized how could you in order to become self actualized and self individualized. You would have needed a healthy parent a healthy authority figure outside of you That was able to make you feel whatever was going on inside of you was enough Now when you grow up in a home where you feel invisible You have to understand that you're you're part of a certain system You're part of a particular paradigm and this paradigm can be completely corrupt Everybody can be running a mop Muck mom could be reacting to dad could be reacting to mom, , your sister could be highly emotional. Everybody's trying to manage and control your sister Your brother might be drinking your sister might be a heroin addict There can be many things going on in your family and no one's paying attention to How people feel on an authentic level how you feel on an authentic level. Everybody's a bunch of atoms or molecules that have been heated up and they're bouncing off of each other No one's calm No one's serene.",

That's what I was really afraid of. I was afraid to face all of the feelings that I stuffed as a child when my mother raged at me, or my mother called me a bad girl, or she called me selfish. That pang of, I am not good enough. I didn't want to feel that. And I thought that if I rescued, if I catered, if I nodded my head, if I people pleased, and I had this fond response when people were upset with me, or I thought I was upset with me, I was avoiding all of that. And it wasn't until I reverse engineered, and that's what I teach in the 12-week class, the 12-week Breakthrough Coaching Program. It wasn't until I reverse engineered that I was able to break through that matrix, break through the subconscious programming, and become more accountable for my own self. And the amazing thing that happened was that I let people off the hook. You weren't responsible for making me happy anymore. You weren't responsible for whether or not my business did or did not do. You weren't responsible anymore for my weight, or how unhappy I was. I was learning to take responsibility for that. Now what happens a lot of times is when you make that shift, when you have that paradigm shift in your mind, the people that you're involved with. They don't it. They want you to fond. They want you to rescue. They want you picking up the phone. They want you saying yes, even though you mean no. They want you taking care of their kids. They want you lending them money.

Did I experience a lot of this. Did I experience a lot of this. Did I experience that kind of aggressive force, even if it was more covert. And is that part of what I am having to grapple with and heal from in regard to my FSA recovery. As I said in a recent video, , it wasn't recent, probably a year ago now, but when you're in these types of families that scapegoat and you're the target of it, a lot of times you're feeling you're on a minefield and you're afraid to step your foot in anywhere because you don't know what's going on. You don't know what's going to explode and blow you up. You also can feel you're on a battlefield with all guns pointed at you and it's your family holding the guns, figuratively speaking. People who grew up in healthy families don't know what it's to feel you grew up in a battleground. They grew up in probably not a perfect family, but a healthy, functional enough family. And I hope that you take time to ask yourself, did I experience a lot of this. I know that you're a tough family, but some of us grew up in situations and in circumstances that felt battlegrounds, unsafe, hostile environments at times, for some of you, perhaps all the time. There's many things I think that we as survivors go through and we just normalize it because it's all we know, especially if it was early on in our lives. We were encountering these dynamics. It took me many, many years for me to get curious and start to wonder about, for example, in my own life, why I was always hiding in a closet. You might have situations that as. It's not normal. That's not what is optimal for children growing up, that they're hiding in closets. The big question is, what are you hiding from. What were you hiding from.",

    "text": "This is why I call family scapegoating abuse. One of the most horrific forms of abuse. And I think that's one of the most serious forms of abuse that anyone could experience, especially a child. And it just gets piled on more and more usually into adulthood, except in families where it's musical chairs. Someone's a scapegoat today and the golden child today, and then they switch chairs and now you're the golden child and they're the scapegoat. And that's a whole nother video that we'll get to at some other time. 11. You feel uncomfortable around your family of origin, separate, different, not part of. 12. You feel trapped in a role of some kind, feel stifled and constricted in your interactions, a sense of having to walk on eggshells. You may feel your soul is in a vice and being squeezed. 13. You may feel you're not able to relax and feel your true self did a couple of videos on that, by the way, recently. 14. Around your family member, this feeling of dis-ease lack of ease, dis-ease disease might translate into areas of your life, resulting in your feeling an outsider. This might in turn cause you to behave in ways that contribute to your sense of social isolation due to being unable to trust others or take interpersonal risks. And many scapegoated adults who, even if they have figured out what happened to them, I get a lot of people writing me saying, I get it. I understand it. I accept it. Thank you for your work. And I'm going to probably isolate and keep to myself for the most part, the rest of my life. And I understand that. I also want to say that I know if you'd want to, and you may not want to, you can push through that. You can work through that. And again, expand beyond that. But it's something you'd really, even if you didn't want to do it, you might realize maybe you need to do it. We are social creatures. We do tend to do better when we have community or at least a few people we feel care about us and that we care about. But I don't push my clients on that. I just invite them to imagine that it's possible.",

And this, of course, may continue to your experience of imposter syndrome. I have a video about that too, and it's an oldie but goodie.

And last but not least, and I know there's more than 16, and I'm going to ask you actually to share ones you would add in a moment. 16, you may have had no choice but to reduce or limit contact with one or more family members to protect your own mental and emotional health. Sometimes physical. I've had adult clients come to me who are being physically assaulted by siblings, for example. it's not always psycho-emotional. You may question yourself for this decision. You may feel guilty, bad, wrong for distancing yourself from your family. Nuclear or extended family members may openly state to others that you deserve to be an outcast and take no responsibility for their part in the dysfunctional interactions or for your pulling away from the family system, particularly if their actions towards you were overtly or covertly abusive. And if you broke contact, of course, then you're selfish. You don't care about family. And all of that now is rolling into the scapegoat narrative. that is a 16. This VaultOS version 2,112,112,321.

Now that's, wow, that really, really hurts. It feels horrible. It feels maybe even death. Because again, banishment. That banishment is about the likelihood of death. I suggest that you might think about, from your current adult stance, what you would want to say to yourself as an adolescent. What you would want to say to reassure her, him, or them that their pain and humiliation won't go on forever. That they will survive it. And that you'll be there for them. That you'll be there for them. just take some time now, some moments, to envision yourself as an adolescent or as a pre-adolescent. And just what words would you want to say to them. What would you want to tell them. What would you want them to know from your stance as an adult, from your heart, from your being. And see how that feels inside. What kinds of sensations, feelings, images, or thoughts come up for you, come up in your mind. As you console your adolescent self, consider journaling about these feelings and thoughts. And if you're not sure what you're talking about, then you can write to me. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure.

But what's really important, and which gives us the way of moving out of the shame, is that shame is something that happens specifically in our bodies. if there's somebody facing us, or we're imagining somebody, we're imagining somebody facing us, or we're imagining somebody facing us, or we're imagining somebody that was facing us, we turn away from their gaze, look away and down, and then we collapse. Our shoulders come forward, and we collapse around our diaphragm, kind of bending forward. But don't go too far, just go a little bit. And then come back up slowly, slowly, slowly. And notice how you're sitting now. Does your spine feel longer in any way. How does your chest feel. How does your belly feel. , once more. Something comes up around the issue of shame, and we feel what our body wants to do. Our body, again, wants to curve forward, look away, collapse down, and then just holding it there, holding it there, slowly, slowly coming up, vertebra by vertebra, all the way from your lower back, all the way up to your thoracic spine. And then you get a sense of lengthening and also of opening in the chest. Because really, the opposite of shame is pride. Is, I mean, authentic pride. , just notice how you experience pride in your body. And that you can go from feeling shame, which is this, to opening from the chest. And then you can go from feeling the shame into extension, into lengthening, and into pride and dignity. Because remember, that shame is something that strips away our dignity, and pride is what takes us back to our dignity, to our bodily sense of pride and dignity. , can you feel love for this hurt child. For this shamed or humiliated child. Can you feel love, caring, compassion. And can you also feel that kind of caring and compassion to that adolescent part of you. Because we carry in our bodies all of those baby, child, adolescent experiences in our bodies. And now what we're doing is, we're reworking them that we don't have to be stuck in shame. And because we can never move into life fully when we are in shame, when we're in the posture of shame.",

They only know themselves, and they have no one else to blame if something is wrong in the world. we refer to it, the child brain is basically, what's developed is the limbic brain, which is the emotional center, the cortex hasn't developed yet. And it's called egocentric thinking. everything they see through their eyes that affects them, they caused it, everything is related to them somehow. if dad's too busy or mom and dad get a divorce, I must have done something wrong, it must be my fault. If I get sexually abused, I must have brought it on. everything is an egocentric way of thinking. I see, because they're really the only player on the court, kind of. Exactly, exactly. And then what happens, though, with that is they make adjustments, hoping to get love and acceptance and get their needs met and stay safe, but something way back here now goes, you're phony. they get the imposter syndrome, which says, you're getting love and acceptance, but if they knew the real you, they wouldn't be giving you that love and acceptance, because you're an imposter. the solution hasn't fixed the problem.

engage the parasympathetic is to bring on depression because depression brings in the parasympathetic and it forces you to slow down it forces you to shut down wow and then for some they keep pushing they keep pushing and some go to drugs because drugs will give you the energy to keep going and they keep then your body actually just burns itself out and shuts itself down then you have a total not just an emotional burnout you have a physical burnout wow your body can create depression in order to give the parasympathetic because then you're at least going to slow down you're going to exactly even if there's these other side effects of how you feel about it exactly what happens to a little child is how do they learn the parasympathetic they we call a co-regulator mom or dad is regulated emotionally as calm they're in their parasympathetic they look them in the eyes and they regulate their own nervous system to mom and dad but if mom and dad are absent or mom and dad are angry all the time your regulator's not there or they're regulated they're triggering you and keeping you full of fear and anxiety wow it's it's messing you up or if you have parents that just are work work if you relax you're lazy if you relax you're selfish they're they're forcing you by this work ethic to be out of balance and actually it's creating very subtle complex trauma because you're just a workaholic and you feed off it and you're driven but what happens is that's normal then you're creating a normal that is extremely abnormal exactly man i just to have some part my mother didn't look at me when i was a child i don't remember i don't and i don't say that i don't need sympathy or anything i'm just saying that as an adult recognizing that this child wasn't looked at in the eyes i'm glad i exist and but she if there were an emotional thing she couldn't connect she almost had an emotional autism yes if i were physical if i got hurt she could help the second i got hurt but if i'm sitting across from her feeling a certain way yes it doesn't even it's there's there's she can't she didn't come to me she can't i don't know how to describe it that was the most passion i've ever had in my life she can't come to me she would hug she couldn't hug me for more than half a second and i'm not saying that as a whiny baby i'm just i'm trying to relate to some of the stuff you're talking about one of the things that happened was i noticed as i got older i didn't know how long and my father was a senior citizen and he was really absent i didn't know how long to look into somebody's eyes i remember i'd have this weird stuff sometimes where i would check in with somebody's eyes but then look away while i was explaining myself man yes makes me feel bad for myself not it doesn't make me feel bad as an adult but it makes me feel bad yes that kid had to do that can i speak scientifically to that again you're the first response to danger is the brain releases cortisol which is adrenaline and that gives you the energy to fight or flight you get you can fight harder you can run faster because you got adrenaline happening but if you're too little to fight or flight then that's cortisol is not doing you any good and if your parents are punishing you for being angry etc the brain then switches and produces opioids natural opioids and it says we're going to shut down and what happens with that is that you dissociate you move inward and all the blood comes from the muscles around the heart because it's basically saying we're going to get ready to get hurt we're going to get ready to get cut we don't bleed as much we're going to put all the blood around here that if we get hurt out here cut out here nothing is we're not going to bleed as much really your body does that no way your body's now gone to that fight or flight don't work now we're going to freeze and then what some kids learn in freeze is but i still need my needs met now i learned to fawn i will learn to say whatever you want me to say be whatever you want me to be just don't hurt me just put up with me wow that's your four f's that develop but what we have what happens what are they against we know them fight flight freeze and fawn wow but what has happened is fight or flight you're basically your emotions are out there freeze your emotions go in you shut them down and most people with complex trauma don't do with emotions they shut down emotions they don't even know they have emotions and what we say is that most complex trauma families they have three emotions mad sad and glad dad can be mad mom can be sad but the kids got to be sad be glad man i remember i would i ask people how do i feel about this which is crazy man i know it's not some of this i know sounds maybe crazy to some people but i remember i just didn't even have any i didn't know how i felt about anything i just knew how you felt yes and how i needed a scene yes and what happens to a child who's fawning is i'm more to how you're feeling than to how i'm feeling oh i was falling i was a damn bambi babe what i'm saying i was a bambi in memphis i know your emotions better than my own i know what you think and believe more

in the early part of the caffeine it used to during the second Dndi of eating the value of been a way to say I had been From now on I didn't know what was hanging me down I didn't know what failure ma

    "text": "And what happens in complex trauma is constant gaslighting of a child that whenever any parent or authority is having a bad emotion, the child is made to feel it's their responsibility to fix that emotion. No, it's not. They can't fix their dad's anger. Only dad can fix his own anger. But they're made to feel if they just did more chores, if they weren't making noise, if they were more agreeable, more obedient, then dad would never get angry. But dad always gets angry. But you keep believing the gaslighting lie. now when you go into relationships, as soon as your spouse is a little bit sad, what did I do wrong. Maybe I should do something here. Maybe I should do this. You still take responsibility for everybody else's emotions. And that sets up relationships to be codified. And that sets up relationships to be codified.

    "text": "That's been key. I think when it comes to parenting, a couple of thoughts. The danger is every parent wants to be a perfect parent, and it's really important to go, it's all about good enough parenting. Nobody's a perfect parent, but we can be good enough parents. And that means we're going to fail. We can't be super man to our kids. We have limitations. We can't be awake 24-7, but we can be good enough. a child needs parents who are attuned to them and who connect. Now, you don't connect 24-7 with a child, but they need a few minutes a day of just really safe connection with the parent to feel, , this is my rock. This is, I'm secure. Everything's with the world. And parents can provide that good enough connection. And what's been important, I think, for parents to understand is our whole focus in the West as parenting is you've got to meet their physical needs. Physical needs, , you've got to make sure they get their milk at this time and they get to bed and they have safety and all that. What we're realizing is the child's biggest needs are emotional needs. And there's acceptance and that attunement. And that connection. All of those needs are important for a child if they're going to develop normally and healthily. And if parents can learn how to meet their emotional needs of their kids, that's what they can do. the other piece to that is we often talk about dysfunctional family, and we think the opposite of dysfunctional is a perfect family, but there's no such thing as a perfect family. there's no such thing as a perfect family. there's no such thing as a perfect family. there's no such thing as a perfect family. The word dis is actually a Greek word that means pain. And it's a family in pain is a dysfunctional family. it's a family that's inflicting pain on each other, but is never resolving it. it's a complex trauma family. the opposite of a dysfunctional family is a functional family, which is a family that inflicts pain once in a while, but they resolve it. And by resolving that pain, then the child isn't traumatized because it's getting resolved. That processing is huge. Exactly.",

alcohol addiction the more your chances of violence in the family abuse partner abuse the more your chances of suicide attempts it's just it and then your greater your chances for heart issues diabetes health issues it just messes everything up in your body it's fascinating it says here the 10 aces and we'll get to the questions in a second were defined as the following childhood experience child childhood experiences physical sexual or verbal abuse physical or emotional neglect separation or divorce a family member with mental illness a family member addicted to drugs or alcohol a family member who is in prison witnessing a parent being abused it says still there are variables that the quiz doesn't account for including stressors outside of the home as the important role positive influences play on buffering the effects of trauma let's see those questions real quick did a parent or other adult in the household often or very often a swear at you insult you put you down or humiliate you or be act in a way that made you afraid that you might be physically hurt did a parent or other adult in the that's number one there's 10 questions here and the more you get the odds of countless tough or pastures in your life yes the consequences the ramifications just grow did a parent or other adult in the household often or very often push grab slap or throw something at you or b ever hit you hard that you had marks or were injured did an adult or person at least five years older than you ever touch you or fondle you or have you touched their body in a sexual way or be attempt or actually have oral anal or vaginal intercourse with you did you often or very often feel that a no one in your family loved you or thought you were important or special or b your family didn't look out for each other feel close to each other or support each other you want to do these tim is that did you often or very often feel that a you didn't have enough to eat had to wear dirty clothes and had no one to protect you or b your parents were drunk or high to take care of you or take you to the doctor if you needed it and number six were your parents ever separated or divorced and i would just say that lots of research is starting to happen around the effects of divorce on children because often we think it doesn't affect them that much because they still see both parents but it does and it's just very subtle but it's powerful was your parent caregiver a often or often pushed grabbed slapped or had something thrown at him or her or b sometimes often or very often kick bitten hit with a fist or hit with something hard or see ever repeatedly hit over at least a few minutes or threatened with a gun or knife did you live with anyone who has a was a problem drinker or alcoholic or use street drugs number nine was a household member depressed or mentally ill or did a household member attempt a suicide and 10 did a household member go to prison those 10 questions there the more you answer if you even get three of those oh yes your odds of addiction I think are above 50 and that's unbelievable because I don't know I don't think I know 10 people that don't have at least two of them exactly and you notice it's talked about neglect just a little bit but it doesn't go into a workaholic dad narcissistic dad all the subtle little types of neglect and that's we've actually created a an ace test of 65 questions that really capture all the nuances of neglect interesting this I just remember read I remember we in this in this facility we were in the hospital and we were in the hospital and we were in the hospital and we were in the hospital and we were in the hospital and we were in the hospital and we all went over this and we all went over this and then people read theirs and half of the class and some of the people in the class were mayors in their towns and stuff and they had really some of them had really beaten some unforeseeable odds and then it made sense to you when you looked around back around my high school when certain kids are oh it makes total sense why that kid's not alive anymore or why that guy's in prison or why that guy's in a rehab facility pretty wild pretty wild but I don't want to get into that downer mentality but it is just fascinating there's a lot out there and that just supports much of the research that's happening now just in understanding the effects of childhood on a we're not just blowing hot air here this is all researched and continues to be researched in great detail and it's just growing and growing in our understanding of this very important topic and that's what I think I was just curious about I just want if people are because here's where I found myself I found myself in a place for me where I couldn't understand why I wasn't able to do certain things especially with relationships and stuff that I kept thinking that it would change and it and it just hasn't it's gotten better things have gotten better I'm a lot more aware I don't make a lot of the same mistakes the negotiations he does he probably hasn't seen no big change in my actions at places that I'm a registered dad and I potential ºæπ ad π µæøÅ floralinclude my love that youcharge forward andÉØ CATHERNALLRAYN thnh JiangÆø that come to our program there is hope but be prepared it takes a lot of work and it's not a quick fix yes it's going to take a lot of time because this started in childhood and you don't undo that overnight but there is hope i heard you talk on one of your thanks for saying that to me and just didn't know anybody that's listening and i believe that i believe that when i go into meetings and you see guys that two years ago were addicted to prostitutes and now they're getting married and they're having children it's you see people change their lives or guys who had never even been on a date in two years and were just addicted to pornography and didn't even realize they were addicted it was just a pattern of comfort i remember when i found my wiener dude when i was probably i don't even know once i found something that could make me feel good soothing i you could have played all the you could play all the madden you wanted i was i had my own game exactly dude and i was two-point conversing and all the time but i was doing it was that was unbelievable to me i would bike across town to go look at pornography at my buddy's house going and digging up pornos over there man it was just because it was the first time i also had a relationship with a woman even was just on a damn page or drawing we had to do to withdraw you some ovaries or something for the weekend can i speak scientifically to that again i don't want to go too long here but cool and sorry i know i'm just talking about a lot of stuff tim i just sorry we're doing our best what we know is when you look at the brain chemicals the brain only produce is designed to produce positive chemicals you got dopamine pleasure chemical then you got oxytocin that feel good connected what you get ecstasy is part of and then you've got oxytocin i'm in love chemical those three chemicals are designed to be produced all the time in the brain of a child because they connect with a parent they feel good they feel a deep joy they feel a deep contentment and their needs are being met and that's connection and the meeting and needs causes those chemicals to be released complex trauma you're not connecting and your needs aren't being met zero chemicals wow what's your brain feel cortisol anger hyper pain rebellion all of that is happening what do you then find the first thing that gives you comfort and part of what we know is your parents are supposed to soothe you when you get dysregulated you might get hyperentomized and you're not connected with the positive emotions but what happens when you get dysregulated when you have negative emotions when you have negative emotions but if you can't connect to them then you're not being soothed properly you find the first thing that self-soothes and some people rock we would rock my brother-in-law's beds were on wheels and in the morning they would be in the corner of their other corner of the room exactly we will rock all night that and what we know is when you cut it actually releases opioids in the brain You don't feel the pain, you feel the relief of the good feeling.",

And it could go from the low end, because we all have a touch of it, to the extreme, where you require excessive attention. Your emotions are unstable, and you're easily angered. And if you feel someone is doing something wrong to you. But the main thing is they cannot handle their emotions and take criticism. And in order to deal with that, they pick a scapegoat. And in the family, there's always certainly going to be one. And that person handles the emotions and gets all of the anger. And that scapegoat makes the family look it's organized, because that's the one that's causing the problem. We're together, but there's a problem over there. And the narcissist usually picks the one that is perhaps giving them a feeling of threatening. , they're not the one who's going to take the blame. They don't have the skills that person has. Or there's something about that one that just trumps up feelings inside of them. And the one thing about the scapegoat, they are always blamed for trying to upset the narcissist, but it's the other way around. And the person who is a narc, even though they may look strong, intelligent, hold high positions, and are charismatic, deep down, inside, they are not the one who's going to take the blame. And , that's the hard part. It's the other way around. And , there's a feeling of unworthiness, and they've been through some sort of trauma that has not been dealt with that leaves them feeling very, very vulnerable. If anyone gets near that spot or triggers it, it's a deadly situation for them. The scapegoat is usually someone who is empathetic and intuitive and will be the first person to know that there is something not. They'll be the first person to realize that something is not.",

I can't say that I know who they are, because we were each talked about the other badly behind. our backs. And another way that they do it is the narc holds you together, holds the family united in this, is by what they call flying monkeys. And I've heard that term. And I said, , is that a real term.

And they get together and hold the scapegoat down for the narcissist. And then another way that it's kept is with projection.

And they need to find a way to account for the discrepancy interpersonally. Reason number nine, why people with complex PTSD might lie is almost kind of the inverse of this, but could be related, actually. You lie because you don't want to have to caretake the other person's feelings around if you were to tell them the truth. And if I'm being totally honest here, that's 90 of the reason why I, for example, lie about my chronic pain. I don't want to stress people out. By letting them know how bad it is for me, I'm used to the level of badness. I'm used to dealing with extreme pain. I'm used to dealing with a lot of scenarios that other people aren't used to. And I imagine if I were to explain to them what I'm going through, it would put stress onto them. And I don't want to now have to deal with both my own pain, my own stress, and having to caretake someone else's emotional experience around learning about my stress, if that makes sense. people with complex PTSD, because they often don't know that they can go to other people for care, support, and nurturing, they assume my job is to be fine 100 of the time, to not put my problems on other people. And if I have a problem, I not only have to learn how to completely and totally deal with that problem on my own, I also have to learn how to make other people feel better about the fact that I have a problem. And when you're actively experiencing that problem, the last thing you want to do is also worry about other people's problems. I'm going to let you go through a little bit of a story about this. And I'm going to give you a little bit of an overview of what a P. T. S. D. is, and how you can help other people's emotional reactions to it.",

And if you had not grown up in a way that was extremely complex and caused all of these problems for you, again, complex PTSD is complex, you might have a support system who's familiar with the problems that you go through, and who shows up to help you, and who you don't have to explain why you're experiencing it. if you're not familiar with the problems that you go through, or caretake their emotions around when you're struggling with something. But because complex PTSD is complex, chances are you didn't really know that was an option. You just learned to hide every time you were struggling or in pain. And then you also learned to not communicate it, you didn't have to make other people feel better about it, because you didn't know it was an option to communicate it and receive support and care in return. And that sucks. And it's something that you could learn to do differently as your life goes on, and now you're aware of that. I'm going to give you a little bit of a story about what a P. T. S. D. is, and how you can help people with complex PTSD. But that's just another really common way in which people with complex PTSD tend to lie, is because they don't want to have to manage their own situation and other people's feelings about their own situation, which is what they assume they're going to have to do. Reason number 10 why people with complex PTSD might lie, it feels freaking nice to feel normal sometimes. When you have a history of complex trauma, and you have a life of jumping through weird hoops to have the things that other people consider bare necessities and a normal part of life, , I don't know, a few friends, a partner, a place to live, it feels nice to just sometimes pretend that those things come easy for you too.

    "text": "Curve balls get thrown in our path. Relationships get thrown in our path. Relationships involve conflicts that become challenging. Experiencing stress is inherent to being alive. let's say you come up against a major life stressor. And I'll give some examples just we can kind of track this with something real. Let's say you suddenly lose your job or you don't have a job and rent is coming up and you don't have a way to make rent. That would be considered a major life stressor. Let's say you are taking a graduate program and you have a dissertation due and you are ill prepared to finish it on time. Let's say you are in a relationship and you're feeling a little bit uncertain and your partner might not necessarily want a future with you and you're feeling kind of rejected. All of these things are normal life stressors. They could happen to anybody. It doesn't mean there's something wrong with you. However, the way someone with CPTSD or toxic shame is going to interpret these stressors is going to be very different than the way a secure person does. a secure person, when encountering a life stressor, tends to have a sense of self-compassion around it. there's this feeling of something difficult is happening for me. I'm stressed about it. And that stress is often seen and acknowledged and accepted. But the next step, because there is an assumption inherent to the secure worldview that stress is a normal part of life, is to find ways to cope with that stress that actually help the problem get solved. And I want to be very clear. This is much easier for the person with a secure attachment system to do because it's highly likely that they have a social network that they can reach out to receive a reasonable level of support. It's highly likely that they developed strong emotional regulation skills in childhood or that they taught those to themselves in adulthood if they earn secure attachment. And it's likely that they have not encountered a disproportionate amount of extreme stressors in their life. That's not a guarantee. That's not to say that there are not secure people who have experienced extreme stressors.",

Dysregulation happens when we can't directly resolve the feeling that we are experiencing. If you have hidden the feeling that you are experiencing from yourself because it's shame-bound, it's going to be really hard to resolve it. if I'm feeling kind of vulnerable because I don't know how to pay my rent next month, or because I don't know how to access the resources I need to finish my educational project, or because I don't really understand what's going wrong in my relationship or how to stop these problems from happening, if I'm unable to access and directly deal with it, and directly deal with my feelings of vulnerability, I'm going to become dysregulated. I'm going to start feeling those emotions in places where they don't necessarily fit. instead of feeling vulnerable, maybe I'll start feeling really grumpy or really irritable. Or maybe I'm going to experience extreme difficulty focusing and paying attention to the projects that I'm meant to be working on. Because my system is desperately trying to seek out the comfort that it needs. It's distracted by its own unmet emotional needs which live in the body. However, if I'm not acknowledging those emotions in my mind and acting in accordance with them, I'm going to experience dysregulation. Now, the problem is that when we are in this state of dealing with extreme stress, it's very important for us to be able to focus to solve those problems. If I have to figure out how to make rent next month, I probably need to focus on getting work. If I need to figure out how to get a school project done, I probably need to focus on doing research. If I need to solve a series of problems in my partnership, I probably need to stay reasonably present with my partner to be able to take in what they're saying and respond in an appropriate way. However, it gets harder to do all of this the more dysregulated you are. Ergo, you start procrastinating not because you are a lazy, worthless human being, but because your system is preoccupied trying to get its underlying needs met.",

Maybe I figure out that I can barrel through the day and act tough and strong and I don't need any help if I can promise myself at the end of the day I'm going to binge eat or get drunk in order to take off the pressure. we develop these ways of getting our needs for comfort met if we don't know how to address that need directly in ways that end up creating further problems in our lives. There's a quote that goes something along the lines of at a certain dosage, the medicine becomes the disease. now we find ourselves facing a new slew of problems and or, but usually and, an intensification of the original problem.

    "text": "What secure people naturally know is that being alive is inherently difficult and you need comfort for it. You don't have to be going through something intense and traumatic to need comfort. People need comfort on a day-to-day basis. They need comfort for being a little bit tired. They need comfort for having a little bit of stress at work. They need comfort for having a bit of a tense situation with someone they're close with and having difficulty feeling settled in that relationship until they figure out what's going on. People need a reasonable amount of comfort every single day. And especially when you are going through some sort of stress, needing comfort is a normal experience to have. And the reason I want to emphasize that is because if you sat down as someone with complex PTSD and looked at the intensity of the stress, the intense matrix of all of the challenges and struggles and practical and interpersonal difficulties that you probably have in your life as a product of having complex PTSD, you would recognize that if you dropped a secure person into that, they would be almost overwhelmed by a need for comfort. the fact that you are feeling distressed and dysregulated is not weird and it's not because you're a bad, shameful person who can't cope with anything. If you have a very difficult life, you have a very high need for comfort. And if you're unable to recognize that need for comfort, the natural response is dysregulation of the system. if you can at step one, that point where you're feeling stressed and overwhelmed by either one or a complex matrix of problems in your life, if you can recognize and give yourself validation around the fact that it's normal to be wanting comfort at this point, that might be the first step in getting less dysregulated around all of these problems. If you can look at the fact that you can't make rent next month, or the fact that you have a giant pile of overdue bills, or the fact that you have relationships that are in disarray, or the fact that you're really struggling to keep up with your educational commitments as problems that naturally require comfort and support, that might not solve the problem, but it legitimizes the problem.",

Or are you constantly in chaotic relationships because you didn't learn appropriate relating skills as a child, you didn't have secure relationships modeled for you, and you don't actually have the skills you need to navigate relationships effectively, but if you did have those skills, you would probably use them. That's probably closer to the truth than I'm just a piece of garbage who doesn't know how to love or be loved. If you look at your financial challenges, not through the lens of I'm just lazy and didn't work hard enough, but through the lens of I have been low or high level dysregulated consistently for most of my life, and it's really important that you look at your financial challenges, and it's really hard to be productive and creative when you're dysregulated, it might feel a little bit easier to understand why you're experiencing chronic financial difficulties.

I was in a place where I was much more comfortable with my life, and I was in a place where I was much more comfortable with my life, and I was in a place where I was much more comfortable with my life, and I had this one project that I was struggling hard to complete, and I was getting paid a lot for the project, and there was big expectations on me for it, and I remember waking up one morning and just looking at my life almost I was a complete outsider, and looking at the true intensity of the personal problems I was dealing with at that point in my life, and the true intensity of the practical problems I was experiencing at that point in my life, and going, if my client, the person who I'm imagining, is going to judge me harshly if I do not do a perfect job on this project, if they were truly waking up in my life, in my body, in my relationships, in my experience, and having to navigate through this day, would they be able to get this project done. And I realized, probably not. They would probably have to stop and triage and deal with all of these other things that I consistently deal with that I don't even think of them as problems anymore, that they wouldn't be able to get within a mile of the project. And it's really, really hard to get this project done. And it's really, really hard to get this project done. And it's really hard to have those moments of clarity with ourselves. Because when you are adapted to chronic problems and to chronic dysregulation, it becomes the water that you swim in. You don't think this is abnormal and things that most people don't deal with. However, it helps as often as you can to stop and contextualize that for yourself.",

    "text": "Is it possible that anybody in this situation would be equally as stressed out and experience an equal level of difficulty focusing or getting things done as I am. And if you can have compassion for yourself in that moment, then you are experiencing a moment of security. A moment in which you're able to recognize I am an inherently valuable person, just everybody else. Which means that when I experience stress, I need help and comfort, just everybody else. And every time we have a moment where we're successfully able to recognize that, we start slowly training our brain to think in a slightly different way. The more moments we have where we recognize we are inherently valuable, we are not choosing the challenges and difficulties in our lives, and that it's normal for us to need help and support in navigating through them, the more we slowly inch our way towards that secure worldview, where we're able to recognize I can ask for help. There is no reason why someone else should get help and not me. I need comfort and support and care from other people. There is no reason why I can't ask for help. I need comfort and support and care from other people. There is no reason why I should not have those things, even though everyone else should. Now, I want to be clear, that doesn't mean that any one particular person owes you endless care, love, support, and attention, but it means that it would be a reasonable thing for you to do at some point along the line to build out a social support network in which you're able to give and receive support and comfort around everyday concerns and everyday stressors.

You misunderstood me. I've changed. No one will love you I did. They'll try anything to hook you emotionally. Because that emotion, even if it's anger or frustration, means they still matter to you. And if they still matter, they still have some control. But when you go neutral, when you give nothing, they panic harder. Because they can't read you anymore. They don't know how to strategize around your silence. They can't play chess with someone who's no longer sitting at the board. They may try to provoke you. Push buttons they know you have. Talk about people they know will trigger you. Bring up the past, especially the moments you trusted them the most. Only to weaponize it now. They want to get a rise out of you.

You reflect back the truth they've spent their entire lives avoiding. You become a living reminder of what they are not. Your strength becomes a spotlight on their insecurity. Your growth makes their stagnation obvious. Their ability to maintain dignity, self-respect, and emotional control reveals the depth of their dysfunction. And they hate it. Because now instead of using you as a shiny object to validate themselves, they start seeing themselves through your eyes. And it's ugly. What they once admired in you turns into resentment. Your independence makes them feel powerless. Your peace unsettles them. Your clarity exposes their confusion. And rather than face that truth and grow, they turn against the mirror. They start to feel exposed. Not because you're trying to expose them, but because your mere existence contradicts the lies they tell themselves. You don't have to say a word. You don't have to confront them, accuse them, or call them out. Just being without them, just smiling without their approval, just moving on without giving them a second thought. It's enough to make them spiral. They can't stand seeing you thrive because it invalidates their entire story about who's in control, who's superior, and who's to blame. This is why narcissists often turn hostile after you walk away. Because you've shattered the mirror they wanted. You're no longer reflecting back a version of themselves they can admire. Now, all they see is failure. All they feel is rejection. And not the kind that happens between two adults who drift apart. This feels abandonment to them on a core psychological level. It hits the wound they've been protecting since childhood. That deep buried belief that they are unlovable unless they are in control. And your strength confirms it. instead of facing it, they lash out. They project. They accuse you of being cold, selfish, disloyal. Not because it's true, but because it helps them avoid the truth about themselves. They may accuse you of doing the very things they did to you.

It's a hook. Because they know if they reappear at just the moment, with just the story, they'll find themselves in a psychological chess. And they move fast because they're scared. Not of you, but of losing their grip on the narrative. The speed of these shifts is what keeps people disoriented. One moment you're being love-bombed, the next you're being devalued. One day they act you're the center of their world, the next they treat you a stranger. And through it all, you're left trying to figure out what's going on. And you're trapped. Because the answer is, none of them are. Each version of them is just a response to what they think will manipulate you most effectively in that moment. It's not authenticity. It's survival. It's about maintaining control when their old strategies stop producing results. They might even shift the narrative entirely. Suddenly, they're the victim. They'll tell others how abusive you were, how cold, how unfair, how impossible you were to please. Not because they believe it, but because they need a new way to dominate the story now that you're no longer playing your part. The moment you stop giving them what they want, you become the enemy. That's the pivot. And it happens quickly, smoothly, that you may not even see it coming. Yesterday, you were everything to them. Today, you're the villain and they're spinning to anyone who will listen. And yet, through all these tactical shifts, there's one constant. The need to stay in control of how you think, how you feel, how you define yourself. The tactics change not because they're evolving, but because they're desperate. Because your refusal to play along threatens the illusion they've worked hard to create. The illusion that they're in charge. That their irreversible, irreplaceable. That they are the one who decides the meaning of your story. they switch tactics. Fast. Ruthlessly. Without shame. Not because they care about the truth, but because they can't stand not being the one who writes it.

But in the US, when they talk about the downsides of physical punishment of their kids, often, particularly black people will say, I want to raise my children knowing about and wrong. And the Bible says I need to punish my children and that's what I'm doing. And you should not subvert the teachings of my church. And they don't argue with that because at least not straight on. I grew up in a household where I was punished physically in pretty significant ways. Ways that I probably can share because it's just quite significant. Quite horrendous. And they are horrendous stories actually. I was born in Africa. I've got an African mother and an English father. It's funny because I look back on it and I go, and this is just me rationalizing and hiding. I go, I'm happy that I had a home where there was discipline. Because if I didn't have that home, then I wouldn't maybe have left the city. , one of the few families that actually left the city, the small, fairly small town, relatively small town to some of the towns I live in now, and went and did a lot of things with my life. And I didn't get caught up in drugs some of my friends. I wasn't dysfunctional. And my mother couldn't read or write as. I feel somewhat thankful. But I'm doing, I'm rationalizing in hindsight. Because it somewhat ended up in certain measures of my life. In other areas of my life, there's dysfunction. , and your perception may change. Really. My perception about my life and who I became has changed quite a bit over time as layers come open. But what you talk about, that things were predictable, is very important. My parents also were predictable. Which is enormously helpful for at least for you to understand. At least for you to anticipate, know what you are supposed to do, etc. Chaos is a terrible thing. I think that point is really interesting.",

Is that same visit that my parents finally came. I had a three-year-old daughter at that time. We were staying at a house and I put my parents on the first floor next to the main bathroom. And then my three-year-old daughter went to that bathroom that was next to my parents' bedroom. And my mother came out and yelled at me, said, how dare she use our bathroom. You should punish her. And I almost did. I had an immediate impulse. I should punish my three-year-old. And I started to walk to her and said, oh my God, I'm about, I feel crying. Oh my God, I feel, I'm about to reenact what my parents did to me. And I made a decision. No, mom, she is allowed to use the bathroom. And I set the limit on my mom, which was a transformative experience for me to actually realize that I'm about to repeat what was done to me, which people do routinely. And I was about to meet my daughter. And I said,. I love the answer to it. It still causes you a lot of emotion. It's actually, I'm surprised how much emotion comes up talking about it. Why do you think it's much emotion comes up when you talk about that. Good question. It's an interesting question. Because it allowed me to, , to be more open. Because it allowed me to have a life. Much of life is automatic. But you can make a choice to do things differently. You start owning yourself. And that's the moment I started to own. I'm responsible for my kids. I'm going to do it for what I think is. It's really a moment of liberation, but also a moment of separation. I will not be you. It's tremendously hard to do that.

And I think there's a part of me that's worried actually. Because I grew up in a home where physical discipline was the response to most kind of forms of unwanted behavior.

And what our research also shows is that when you start doing yoga, certain brain areas that tend to be in the way of your body, they're not going to be in the way of your body. And the areas that tend to get dampened by trauma come to life. It's an adaptive thing because trauma is relived in visceral experiences. As Darwin said, heartbreaking gut-venge is the visceral sensations. And if you're constantly heartbroken and gut-wenged, you try to put that down. And you lose contact with your body as a defensive maneuver of feeling overwhelmed by these physical things. I want to make sure I understand this. the insular part of the brain is the part that links what we do with how we feel. How we viscerally feel,. What's happening in our bodies. it links how we're feeling in our bodies to what we know about ourselves. The stories we have in our head about ourselves. that's what the insular does. And trauma interrupts that, which causes what kind of dysfunction on a day-to-day basis. You are out of structure. You feel you're in a coma. You're feeling ecstatic. You feel numb. You feel burly. You feel feisty. You feel numb. You feel blue. You feel disheartened, you feel numb. You feel numb. Or disconnected. You don't feel alive. You don't feel connected. You can't feel pleasure.

It seems to me that people are tired of being told that they have no control over the outcome of their lives and no control over their relationships. Because when you tell people it's not your fault this happened to you and it's that you're this way, which it is, I think people don't want to stay there anymore. And people look to I don't have to be weak all the time or I don't have to feel weak. You can have a weak moment. It's not the same thing with feeling fundamentally weak or insecure or insignificant all the time. And then looking at a moment or a situation or moments in your life and saying I'm this way now because of all these things that happened. And I think for a while that worked.",

But it ends up being a long-term enemy in the context that you're then stuck with the results of who you are, for better or for worse. And I was thinking about myself. I was thinking all the ways that I've justified who I am today using something that happened in the past. And actually, whenever I do that, it's , oh, I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. And I think that's actually, whenever I do that, it makes that behaviour, even if it's the byproduct of it is making me unhappy, really hard to change. , it's very hard to change. , if I say this happened when I was a kid and my dad was unorganised or whatever and messy, I'm a messy person, it's almost etching it into cement or something. Can I ask you a question. Why does it matter. I don't understand why we have to psychoanalyse everything we do. I feel we waste much time. And trying to figure out I'm this today because of this, this and this. Sometimes I have found there's no clear reason why. There's no, there's nothing to make sense of. Even sometimes when people try to assess, , why does this person treat me this way. Why that. What did I do. Why this. Sometimes there are reasons. And sometimes that person's just an asshole. There's nothing analysed. There's nothing to figure out. There's nothing that I dive deep on. That person, you just happen to fall on an asshole. And that's. Let's move on. there's moments where that exists too. But I feel we try hard to figure it out that we do more damage. And, , , your brain is a bathtub. Your cognitive load is a bathtub.

them this person and he had some kind of injury as and i said oh tell me about it i was there and i was injured when i was welding something kind of fell on my foot and as a result i had to go on some kind of disability and i said what happened to your foot and it was i think he had lost his toe or something his pinky and i said and i said how long were you there three days i said were you there for the day of the event no you weren't there for the day of the event your exposure to 9 11 was three days and then you got injured yes i'm clocking this internally to myself his whole life was something that was really hard for me to deal with and i think that's why i'm saying that i'm not a person who's never been hurt by something that's really hard for me to deal with and i think that's why i'm saying that i'm not a person who's never been hurt by something that's really hard for me to deal with and i think that's why i'm saying that i'm not a person who's never been hurt about around the drama the trauma the overcoming 9 11 everything was 9 11 9 11 9 11 and it was such an identity space he was it was all such a horrible thing for him and i'm thinking it wasn't to minimize but i'm thinking how did you build your whole livelihood present day around that small event but that was his identity i thought i remember thinking i'm i did the interview and i had to go i was oh my god i'm gonna go to the hospital i'm going to go to the hospital i'm going to go to the hospital i was i can't be around this because he was just self-focused on how bad that experience was that everything he did and who he was to the point where you have tattoos on your body of the world trade center and i'm thinking how is this helping you move forward there's this concept in psychology called secondary gain that i was i was writing a book about i'm writing this book at the moment i was i wrote a chapter about secondary gain and it basically says exactly what you're saying there's this concept in psychology called secondary gain that i was i was writing a book about secondary gain that i was i was writing a book about exactly what you're describing which is there's always a secondary gain from pain typically there's something you benefit from it and the problem is people can get addicted to that and sometimes it's safety or comfort that you get from it sometimes it's identity and sometimes it's remuneration might be money or other rewards the other example that i was going to say in terms of personas that i'm aware of is the kid who is in his bedroom and can't leave his bedroom because he says there's something wrong with him he might be clinically obese or have some kind of other issue and his family around him are his support network and i actually know someone in this situation where they just don't leave their bedroom and the mother i think she's also getting her identity from being the mother with that child who she's propping up and it was it was interesting that in this particular case with one of my best friends who lives in the middle east when she stopped doing that when she actually heard something on this podcast and stopped propping this person up enabling them this person got better very quickly got better because she basically said i'm not gonna i can't help anymore and also don't talk to me about this i don't have that as you say the cognitive energy anymore this person got better and it made me realize that sometimes two people can keep one person trapped they can i'm the mother i'm the savior that is protecting my child who is unwell and the child is being the cared for and both of the people are getting love and attention and affection from that sort of abusive unhealthy relationship a lot of people find themselves there we think about sometimes the attention you get i'm sorry i'm sorry that happened to you that's sad that can become addicting because you're constantly looking for it but again i've come to accept people as they are i also look at who am i to tell you to be different if this is where you to live and how you to live it i think where it becomes a problem for folks is when it bleeds into your own life with a mom where she had that moment she's i don't want to do this anymore because it's impacting my life then i can understand that because she's i don't want to participate in this but i just have found i want you to think of it this way it's think of a an iceberg think of an iceberg you see the top of the iceberg the little blip at the top of the water and then the big part underneath which is the vast majority of what makes an iceberg we're that when you see another human being i want you to think of got this huge bottom portion of this iceberg that you don't see and it's who makes them what they are one the things that make you who you are today are all the things that have accumulated over the entire time span of your life family is a huge one did you have family were they good family did you have one parent both parents did you have any parents a friend who are your friends growing up who are your friends now your experiences your dramas your traumas all those things make you who you are your values your belief systems your personality do that personality in a human being forms in infancy all these things make you up even your age who you are today is probably vastly different steven than who you were five years ago versus 10 years ago versus 15 years ago that's somebody's iceberg when you take all of that you have that iceberg do you think you're gonna roll in and within what a couple hours a couple conversations you're gonna get them to what shift that's what you're up against often people become very upset because they can't change other people and that's why i'm accept what you had i give a keynote literally this week and a woman came to me in tears at the end this was at a business conference this was for business for communication and a very different thing but she came up to me afterward she said i really want a guidance from you i said sure what is it are you she said i have a husband and he's very overweight and i've done everything i can to try to get him to change and i want to try to use these influence strategies on him to change him that you talked about could you help guide me i said how long have you been dealing with this she's oh a long time years i said does he want to change no she's but i try and i don't want to give up i said did you see that park where i taught the part where i talked about the iceberg remember i showed you the iceberg and i said accept people as they are i said he's the iceberg i said it's not him that's the issue now it's you're not accepting what you have in front of you that's what he is unless you accept you can adapt.",

How does it feel inside your body. And the research I did showed there's really four areas that you feel it. The first area is in your body physically, the tightness in your body, which could be clenched jaw. It could be that fidgeting you see, heart racing, all the fight or flight responses. The second way you feel it is in the mind, self-doubt, asking yourself always, am I good enough. Kind of double guessing yourself, running through worst case scenarios, ruminating on your past mistakes. The third way is in your emotions, which is the way you feel when you're in a situation where you're feeling you're not doing. And then the third way is in your emotions, which is the way you feel when you're feeling you're not doing. And then the fourth way is in your emotions, which is this feeling, this insecurity that you might be exposed at some point, avoiding speaking out too much or holding yourself back. And the last way is in behavior, which is speaking softly, rushing your words, avoiding eye contact and apologizing too much. I feel that's such a waste of time. to spend, to sit and analyze yourself. Now, if you're not a good speaker, I look at it as I want to work on my speech. It's paralinguistics it's called,.

I hope you don't mind. I'm just going to look to it just to make sure I, I speak clearly and I don't make any mistakes. And then go through the points. I actually asked a, a colleague of mine who was in a similar situation, who wanted to have a conversation with me. And their slightly younger colleague of mine, in their early twenties, they said they wanted to speak to me about something. And my advice to them was actually to write it down in a memo, as if you were writing a story, because I love narrative memos. And I did that because I wanted them to properly think about what they wanted to say, because I knew what would happen is they'd come in, they'd start sort of , falling over their words a little bit. They might not, not fully give me all the context.",

They're interchangeable. It's humans don't seek perfection. What we seek is psychological comfort. And whoever provides that is the soonest winner. It is as simple as that. If you can, you're too young. But I remember when computers came out and they were in ugly boxes and they were in ugly stores and they were behind the counter and they were ugly.",

Imagine at any time, at any one time, there's 27,000 applicants to the FBI and they will only accept, 220 maybe or a year. I was, I was elated. I was also very happy the day I left the FBI because at that point I had done it all and I wanted to do other things. I wanted to write, which is very difficult to do when you're in the Bureau.

A lot of great questions. And I think in your questions, the essence is what is the importance of connecting. , your audience is are all in the people business. I mean, unless they're working as a they write code, but even they were all in the people business and the what your questions really circled around is what's the importance of connecting. What's the importance of connecting properly. And then how do we make maintain those connections. And we've talked about this, the importance of nonverbals to communicate. I trust you. I value you.

    "text": "that's kind of the first thing. The second thing is that there is a difference between being somebody who is anxious or avoidant or disorganized in their romantic relationships but has a pretty secure attachment paradigm to say their friends and their parents than being somebody who is disorganized pretty much across the board or who is anxious pretty much across the board. I would describe myself as being quite anxiously oriented with other kids growing up, but pretty secure with you guys. All the way up to very secure with you guys. That was a pretty darn secure relationship for me. Because I knew what a secure relationship looked. I had a model inside of me of a kind of connection to fall back on. Which is really quite different from somebody who has never developed that kind of model inside of themselves. And this means that somebody who grows up in a situation that's more disorganized or has early childhood experiences that aren't safe and secure in that way, things can be particularly tricky for that person because they don't they don't have, they've never had that experience of how could this be different. They have no model to look to be , what's a different version of this. where does this come from. It comes from a lot of different places. A lot of the time, again, growing up early childhood experiences, chaos, disorganization, a parent who was either way too involved and then totally disengaged from you or not involved at all, can also as I said, sometimes come from more traumatic adult relationships where there's sort of this oscillation inside of them. And really what I want to pull out from this is lack of reliability. Because it's inherent in disorganization as a whole. We've talked a lot on the podcast about how important consistency is for kids. The world seems a pretty crazy place in general and they are totally dependent on one or two or a small number of people for their safety and security. they really feeling they understand things and they kind of know what's going on. And more often than not, disorganization comes out of environments where that was not present for that kid. Is there anything that you want to add to that, Dad. , as usual you've done super prep.

And I'll ask you a question for us. Which would be worse. To experience that internally you are reliable for yourself in an unreliable world, or that you are in a reliable world while being internally unreliable for yourself. Which would be worse. Wow. It's a Zen koan. You just hit me there with that. You have to really imagine your way into it, because your internal world is reliable. It's hard for me to imagine my way into an internal unreliable world. I think I would dislike that more. Would be if erupting sometimes with material that isn't quite psychotic. That would be awful. And that's what I want to speak to in a way, with a lot of compassion and respect.

They clutch at a solution. , alright, I'm going to follow a script. I'm going to act a certain way, because that's what we're talking about. It works for me with other people, but even that is hard to sustain, because that externally developed script needs to land on something that's fairly stable inside, but it doesn't get maintained. then you look for somebody else, and it's challenging. I think the result of everything that you're speaking of are the big things that we think of as quote unquote symptoms of this. But the basis of it is that underlying feeling of internal instability. externally, that can look at ambivalence around connection, or not even ambivalence, really strong feelings both ways. I don't always the word ambivalence, because it implies both feelings are pretty mild. The person might both really crave connection and be absolutely terrified of connection. There's a feeling of emotional overwhelm both in approach and in withdrawal for the person. They could have some difficulty with trusting other people, often because they had experiences of other people not being tremendously trustworthy, or regulating emotional intimacy and closeness with others. There are often patterns in their relationships of boundary confusion, fuzzy boundaries, one day the wall is really high, the next day the wall is non-existent, and then maybe some more general symptomology emotional shutdown, dissociation, hard time forming, more lasting bonds with other people. And the basis of all of that is exactly what you're talking about, Dad. It's this internal sense of, ugh, I don't know. I wanted to ask you about something that really stands out to me from this, also in just thinking about it. I've really seen people come a long way with this. Elizabeth has talked really openly about having a fearful attachment style, and I've just seen how much she's been able to change in her work with it.

You're in a relationship, let's say, and you can look at this from both sides. if you are on the receiving end of someone who, let's say, is more disorganized in their attachment style, it's really important to kind of fill in the blanks of what they're trying to communicate because they themselves may not even know how they feel. I've just said, oh , be full-throated and wholehearted. , thanks, Captain Obvious, but how do I actually do that when I don't know how I feel. And I'm terrified of even getting in touch with a piece of it. if you're on the receiving end, being really good, scaffolding, you fill in the empty spaces with curiosity and inquiry and receptivity, and you want to keep, in effect, conveying I can handle this. I'm. I can handle this. Let's slow it down for a breath or three I can kind of catch myself. But basically, I can really handle this. I'm with that. Because again, if you're that little infant, the world could not handle you. The world is not your world. They could not take care of you. They could not manage you. Part of what you're doing as a kid is boundary testing, effectively. You're seeing what happens when you do different kinds of things. And one of the roots of disorganized attachment is getting a lot of bad responses when you were doing these things. And you're with the other person as that partner or friend or ally or therapist saying, this is not going to end our relationship. You're not putting our relationship at risk by doing this. , we may need to repair a few things and kind of have some mutual understandings going forward. And this is not fatal to the relationship. It won't annihilate anything. People, again, with this disorganized quality, because sometimes it can feel annihilationist on the interior, there's a fear of annihilation. Including maybe a catastrophic loss of an attachment figure. It's really important to keep. Another thing, too, I think, is being in the present on both sides. Because in the present, we go on being.

    "text": "And then I'll do a little extra on the recovery process. I know you've got to go in a couple of minutes here. But is this part of the answer to how people get better at self-regulation. Because the self-regulation aspect of it I think is a huge part of disorganized attachment for people. They just have a very difficult time regulating their internal experience. I think that what you talked about earlier, about just letting it all out, can actually be in the service of self-regulation ultimately. Because you really pop the lid, you get the feelings out, you find after you finally say the thing, or you finally have the emotion or whatever it is. It actually gets a lot easier to be with your internal world after that. But if there's anything else you would to add to that piece of it, the more self-regulation aspect, I would love to hear. Thanks for that. Take care of your body. That's really important because often, how high ACEs score predispose people to chronic health problems. ACEs being adverse child experiences. And it's not at all in common that a person, for example, has some kind of chronic reactivity to fill in the blank. Take care of your body. Protein with every meal. Be careful about stuff that's dysregulating physiology. Eat. Get some exercise. Have daily routines. These things really, really help protect your body. Get sleep if you can. Protect your body. The last thing I'll just toss in here is one of the most regulating things of all is love flowing through us. Truth. And there can be this feeling, depending on attachment experiences, particularly in disorganization, disorganized attachment, that somehow we're broken, tainted, spoiled, irredeemable, completely destroyed. No. The innate lovingness that comes up from the of being in your own depths is undestructible, indestructible. And as it flows through you, it will organize you and kind of regulate you and focus you along the way, including as it flows out into the world. Whether it's your cat, your neighbor, your friend, your tomato plant, loving flowing through you will organize you. And also it tends to create the best odds of good treatment from others. Acts of creation in general, I think, are another great example of that.",

That stability feels uninteresting to them. And it can be tough to tell somebody, you've got to pursue boredom. That can feel a weird sort of thing to say. But for many people who have essentially only ever experienced a dysfunctional relationship, it can really authentically feel that way. And this is something I've heard friends of mine talk about, how they had to ride out it just feeling sort of dull for a little while, and over time you get a bit more discernment. There are relationships that are dull in a bad way, and there are relationships that are dull in a good way. And with a little bit more experience inside of that more functional relationship, you'll often get more of a sense of , , which bucket is this in. Of course, you want to feel interested in the person that you're hanging out with, you want to find what they're saying more or less interesting most of the time. But those other aspects of the relationship, the respect, the kindness, the caring, all of these things that frankly, we do not really teach people to care about in relationships, particularly if you're somebody who's more late teens, twenties. What we teach people to care about in those relationships is frankly a lot of stuff that doesn't age very. let's say that somebody's done that. They've developed a little bit more self-trust, self-respect, they've had maybe one or two better experiences out in the world, they feel they're starting to be able to develop better regulation of their internal world, they've built more of that coherent narrative, they've done that process that Rick was talking about of really claiming the fullness of the desire of that part or of what can really feel all of them now. You've gone through that whole process,. Where does that land us. The end of that process for people often is a very different kind of communication style emerges for them.

My brother knows me, and he remembers details of my life that nobody else knows. And that was, somebody should measure my cytokines and stress hormones at that moment, because I bet something changed in my body, feeling seen and known by somebody. , super powerful. And I think that's very, if, , John Bowlby, the great attachment researcher from here, he said, if you're not known to other people, you're not known to yourself. And I think that's a huge dimension in medicine and education, that oftentimes people are not known by the people, but the moment you feel this person knows me, the shame goes down, and you become accepting of yourself, and you start making changes,. For someone to know you, you have to be vulnerable with them. You have to open up with them, and let them see you, which, of course,. will find very hard. Now, people pleasing is a very common trait that many people have. I certainly used to have it to a very high degree. I hope, I think it's much, much less than it used to be. But people pleasing is often an attempt to, I guess, manipulate other people's perception of you. Because you're often not truly being yourself because you want to be accepted,. you're saying the things, doing the things, the people around you, but that's not the same as knowing you, is it. That's true.",

I talked to her. , we had a 10 minute consultation, but I ended up spending 30, 35 minutes with her talking, even though there were patients waiting. I invited her back the following day.

I found, I can think of five or six different examples. I mean, two that come to mind. Quite a few years ago now, when I was experimenting with this trainer at a gym, I just did it for two or three months just to feel what it, , what is it. I heard really good things about this guy. And he also did lots of active release on your muscles and things. And, , I always used to have in inverted commas, tight hamstrings. And I would just, at the end of each session, he'd spend some time stretching them and loosening them, but they'd always come back. Anyway, I didn't see him for a year or two. And in that time, I think I was doing some internal family system therapy work with this amazing guy who lives near to me called Christian. And I was just feeling lighter and freer just in my whole being. And I was driving past the gym one day and I sort of, or I knew I was gonna be there. I called up and I said, oh, let's have a session. And funnily enough, he basically examined my hamstrings. He said, Ron, what have you been doing. They're really, really loose. , ,. And again, there's a lot more detail there, but in essence, me working on my past and my trauma changed my body,. It wasn't through stretching my hamstrings. That's. That's. It was mechanical. It was mechanical. But I think it works both ways as. , , that's. That's. Because you can also free up your body. I spoke to, we've not put this episode out yet.

The brain has to do, it's called the insulat. that. But explain it anyway for the audience who may not. But there's an organ in the body that tells you what your body is feeling and what your body needs. There's a two-way communication. For example, if you go out, you think, is it waning.

And if you're not aware of what's going on in your body, you get situations people who are pregnant and think they're just becoming obese. Because they start to touch their bodies. Really. Oh.

You cannot feel human connection. your whole world, it gets locked up. And you need to slowly open up your relationship to your body. You need to know where you have to go poop.

The reason I asked you the question about healing with thought alone wasn't necessarily to get the answer. It was more to promote discussion around this topic. since my dad died in 2013, I feel that I've, that was the big moment for me to start going inwards and looking at my life and making sense of my life. And I've done a variety of things on that journey. Including IFS, internal family systems therapy by Dick Schwartz. Including working with great movement coaches to move more efficiently. But I will still say, as I mentioned to you yesterday, that one of the most powerful experiences I've had that fundamentally changed me was my podcast conversation with Edith Eger. ,. 93-year-old lady, when I spoke to her, went to Auschwitz when she was 16, survived Auschwitz, came out, spoke with just forgiveness and love and compassion. Really quite remarkable how forgiving as a human being she was. And there's many things she taught me in that conversation. One of the, , without going into the whole conversation, , one of the final things she said to me was that, was Rangan, look, I have lived in Auschwitz and I can tell you the greatest prison you will ever create. Is the prison you create inside your own mind. And that really resonated with me. And- That's the perspective when Auschwitz survived. Exactly. Because her statement is absolutely correct.",

And by the time it finished, I knew I could get into the house and go and put my kids to bed. But I just had to pause. , I fundamentally felt differently. I will still say to this day, I was not the same person at the end of that two hours as at the start of those two hours. And I can apply my rational mind and go, , whenever I struggle to reframe something in life, which is rare these days, but when I used to struggle, I'd go, hey, Rangan, listen, Edith could reframe stuff in Auschwitz. She basically started to see the prison guards as prisoners. She said they weren't free in their mind. I was free in my mind. that was- Stunning. It's stunning. It's hugely inspiring to me. I've taken that as inspiration. I'm not saying that would connect with everyone. For some reason, at that point in my life, it deeply connected with me. I feel now having practiced actively reframing situations in life, I feel now that unless I'm sleep deprived or chronically stressed, I feel I'm not the same person. I feel that I rarely get triggered anymore in the way that I used to. Now, I put a lot of it down to that conversation. getting back to the point about thought or body, that was a cognitive conversation. , that's why I'd to-. I disagree with you on that. See, what I think happened is you met an amazing person, a truly astonishing person, and your mirror neuron system in your brain picked up the energy of this unbelievable person. And that allows you to take a new take on reality, but it's the energy on a deeper level in your brain that makes you open for reframing some stuff. And some people have the capacity.

    "text": "Absolutely. That's very much my take on things. I think every culture, this trauma has always been ubiquitous. very much of a part of a culture is how do you deal with trauma. And yoga in India and Qigong and Tai Chi and acupuncture in China, singing and marching in Germany. every culture has this Sufi dancing, maybe in Muslim religion, we don't know, we haven't studied it. But every religion has inculcated trauma methods. And I think for us, as Western researchers, doctors, it's very important to discover what that particular culture has already has, and to honor what is in place there. I mean, I've seen Thai Qigong being practiced in China. And my first reaction is, I was back in early 90s, what are these people doing. And then I joined people in the park and I go, wow, my whole body feels much calmer and more focused. And yoga, bending over, touching your toes and putting your butt in the air. And then you start doing it. I said, wow, this is amazing. This really helps people. One of the things I mean, I want quite, go as far as say I've been concerned about it, but I think about a lot and that we now live these sedentary lives. moving our body is clearly important for physical, mental, emotional, spiritual health, , we literally changes us as we move our bodies and just go for a walk in nature, you can feel fundamentally different about yourself and your life. And I feel and I have to take responsibility that sometimes we have these conversations on this podcast about the importance of let's say, the physical health of our body. And I feel that's a resistance training as you get older, you lose lean muscle mass. And it's important as you get older, to do things that mitigate that loss to keep you as you get older. But I feel with many things we come, we become quite reductionist. And often, of course, moving your body is a good thing,. But if you're sedentary, and you're in a flexed posture all day, and then you go to the gym to work on your muscles, and you're doing more flexed movements and bicep curls.

    "text": "And every emotional response you give them, whether it's anger, hurt, pleading, or even righteous defiance, feeds their ego. It confirms that they still have the power to affect your inner world. That's what they want more than agreement, more than love, impact. When you confront a narcissist, you enter into their arena. You step into the game they've designed. And the moment you do, they've already won something. It doesn't matter how eloquent or logical you are. The fact that you're engaging at all proves to them that they still matter to you. They will twist your words, deny your experience, turn the narrative around, and often end up making you the problem. You'll leave the argument more drained than before, wondering how the original issue was completely lost. That's the trap. Confrontation with a narcissist isn't a path to resolution. It's fuel for their manipulation. Indifference, on the other hand, is terrifying to them. Because it signals something they cannot manipulate. It tells them, consciously or not, that they no longer hold emotional weight in your life. Indifference is not coldness or cruelty. It's neutrality. It's the complete withdrawal of emotional investment. You're not trying to hurt them or get revenge. You simply do not care. And to the narcissist, this is existentially threatening. They thrive on being the centre of attention. The emotional focal point of every interaction. Whether through love or hate. If you no longer react, no longer chase, no longer explain, they begin to unravel. The power of indifference lies in the fact that it communicates a truth without the need for explanation. You don't have to scream, I'm done. You don't have to list all the ways they've hurt you. You simply detach. You go silent where you usually are. You shrug where you used to defend. You shrug where you used to argue. You change the subject where you used to dig for meaning. This is psychological starvation for a narcissist. They interpret your indifference as a loss of influence. Which, for someone built on the illusion of control, is unbearable. It's important to understand that narcissists rely on a pattern. Provoke, observe your reaction, then exploit. They'll push buttons. Bait you with insults or false concern. And watch closely to see what emotional strings they can pull. Indifference cuts the string entirely.",

    "text": "As long as you are reacting, you are still playing their game. You are still acknowledging their influence over your emotional state. And for them, that's a win. But when you replace emotional reactivity with consistent action, predictable, steady, grounded behavior, that aligns with your values, you remove their power. Consistency is unsettling to a narcissist, because it can't be manipulated. They are used to instability, and in fact, they often create it. One moment they might be charming, the next cold or cruel, the next vulnerable and apologetic. This inconsistency is a tool. They use it to keep you emotionally off balance, questioning yourself, and constantly trying to adjust to them. When you become consistent, you stop adjusting. You create a fixed center, a non-negotiable rhythm to your behavior, that isn't dictated by their moods or their demands. You don't scream, you don't beg, and you don't explain yourself endlessly. You simply follow through. And they strip them of their ability to control you through chaos. You want to be seen. You want to be controlled. But not just control of circumstances. Control of perception. They want to be seen a certain way. They want to dictate the narrative of who they are, who you are, and what the relationship means. Emotional reactions give them material to twist that narrative. If you're angry, they'll say you're unstable. If you're hurt, they'll say you're too sensitive. If you fight back, they'll say you're the abuser. But consistency is immune to narrative manipulation. When your actions are calm, measured, and aligned with truth, there's nothing for them to distort. They can't argue with a boundary that is enforced without drama. They can't rewrite a story that isn't being emotionally co-written. It takes discipline to remain consistent in the face of provocation. Narcissists are skilled at finding your weak spots, your insecurities, your empathy, your hope for reconciliation. They will test you repeatedly, trying to lure you back into old patterns. This is why emotional neutrality is essential. You must learn to expect their games and meet them with steady detachment. Not apathy, but clarity. Not cruelty, but control. You are not punishing them, you are protecting yourself. And that distinction, maintained consistently, sends a message they cannot ignore. Consistency also reclaims your energy. Emotional reactions are exhausting. They pull you into cycles of doubt, confusion, and regret.",

    "text": "Pain has a way of shaping a human being in ways nothing else can. It sharpens awareness, it strips away delusion and it reveals the depth of your capacity to endure. But pain alone does not guarantee growth. Pain can easily become a breeding ground for resentment, bitterness, and cynicism if it is not consciously transformed. When you are placed in the life of a narcissist, the suffering you endure is real. It cuts deep into your sense of identity, it fractures your trust in others, and it tempts you to harden your heart against the world itself. But the calling placed upon you is not to become bitter. It is to transmute that pain into a kind of strength profound that it elevates not only your life but the lives of others. Resentment is the natural first reaction to injustice. It arises from the recognition that you have been wronged, that your kindness has been exploited, that your vulnerability has been used against you. But if you stay in resentment, you remain tethered to the very person who hurt you. You allow the narcissist to continue dictating the terms of your emotional life long after they are gone. Resentment chains you to the past. It keeps you small, angry, and reactive. It is a poison disguised as protection. It promises to keep you safe and hardening your heart. But in reality, it only ensures that the damage inflicted upon you remains unfinished. Transformation, on the other hand, demands courage. It requires that you look directly at your pain without flinching. It asks that you face the full reality of your suffering without allowing it to define you. Instead of recoiling into hatred or victimhood, you are called to extract meaning from your wounds. You are called to recognize that while you could not control what happened to you, you have absolute authority over how you will respond to it. Strength is born not by denying the pain, but by carrying it with honor. By allowing it to carve depth into your soul without surrendering your capacity to love, trust, and hope. To transform pain into strength means you allow the experience to teach you without allowing it to destroy your faith in life. You become wiser, but not suspicious. You become discerning, but not cynical.",

    "text": "Every boundary you enforce becomes an example to someone who still believes they must sacrifice themselves for the sake of peace. Every act of self-respect radiates outward, encouraging others to seek their own freedom. True transcendence is not achieved by pretending the pain never happened. It is not denial, and it is not blind optimism. It is the deep, unshakable knowledge that while evil exists, it does not have the final word. It is understanding that betrayal can wound you, but does not have the power to define you. It is recognizing that love, courage, and truth are stronger than manipulation, cruelty, and deceit. When you transcend, you embody these truths not as abstract ideals, but as living realities, visible in how you move through the world. How you speak, how you act. Leadership born from suffering is different from leadership born from ambition. It is quieter, deeper, more authentic. It is not about drawing attention to yourself, but about pointing towards something greater. It is about walking with those who are still wounded, not from a place of superiority, but from a place of solidarity. It is about bearing witness to their pain without flinching, because you have been there yourself. It is about holding a mirror up to their strength, when all they can see are their failures and their fears. It is about creating spaces where healing can begin, where the lies can be dismantled, and where the truth can take root. You are not meant to live forever in the shadow of what was done to you. You are meant to rise, to build, to create, to inspire. You are meant to take the lessons carved into your soul and turn them into wisdom that liberates not only yourself, but everyone you encounter. The darkness you walked through was real, and it was brutal, but it also equipped you with the kind of light that cannot be extinguished. You are not merely a survivor, you are a beacon.

That something difficult happens to us. Maybe we could call it traumatic. Something difficult happens to us. And then we store that experience in our body and relive it involuntarily. and if we don't pay attention to how the body's doing that, then it can create long-term damage. Exactly. It can linger and linger and linger. And we can even start experiencing physical symptoms such as irritable bowel if this goes on in a chronic way. it's we sometimes think of it as being psychological, but it's very much somatic. It's very much something that registers in our body and that we can change that, we can shift that. I could, if you want, do a little example with you and with the people who are viewing the webinar. Sure. there's a nerve that goes from the back of the brain down through the diaphragm until all of the organs below the diaphragm, particularly the gastrointestinal. But it also goes to the heart and to the lungs. And this nerve is the largest nerve in the body. But what many people don't know is that 80 of that nerve is actually sensory. It's taking information from our guts and bringing it up back into the brain. if our guts are twisted, we're going to feel this anguish. , Charles Darwin, one of my great heroes, Einstein and Darwin, knew about this nerve and he called it the pneumogastric nerve. pneumo, lung, gastric, gastrointestinal system. And he also realized that it was responsible, and this is really amazing how he came to this, that it's responsible for gut wrench and heartbreak. And I couldn't even add something that's more prescient or more. more to the point than his, than Darwin's observation. if we can change the signal from the viscera, from the guts, then the trauma sensations can then start to recede. here's the example and I'll demonstrate it.

But it, unfortunately, that can be problematic. And actually in the book, I talk about this as promises and pitfalls to really examine this and its use. And especially when we can come to the body directly without these catalysts. anyhow, what sticks is really what's happening and having those feelings of warmth. Now I can explain that, in terms of the different parasympathetic nervous system. My very, very dear friend and colleague, Steven Porges, if you haven't had him on, he'd be a good person to have on. And we've been very close friends for since 1975, 1976. And he talks about three systems, the sympathetic nervous system, the fight or flight system, the shutdown system, where the vagus nerve is overactive and the guts just keep churning. And then also what he calls a social engagement system. And that should be the one that should be our default as primates and as mammals. in other words, when we are not in fight or flight and we're not in the shutdown state, our natural impulse is to connect with others, to make eye contact, to be in contact with others. To share something together, to share a meal, to share a movie. And again, these are ways that we desire contact with others. it's not about brute force anymore, but it's about cooperation. And cooperation comes from being open in our nervous system to that inner regulation. I'm very intrigued. And I do want to talk, I want to come back later to psychedelics, but let me just say, with the basics of SE, somatic experiencing, you just showed us one breathing and sounding technique. I would imagine that within somatic experiencing, there are other techniques that you use. Oh yes. Many, many other. Many other. , often people present with physical pain and usually physical pain is due to bracing and bracing, bracing in the body against being hit or even bracing against certain feelings, certain emotions, particularly sadness, grief. And, but if we, if we bring our attention to our bracing, usually the person will report, for example, that they're feeling pain in their shoulders.",

But for example, are you willing to be another round as a Guinea pig. I am putty in your hands. I can see again, there's a fair amount of tension in your shoulders. Yes. I want you to explore what might happen if the tension in the shoulders increased even a little bit, what kind of movement might, there you go. And then just letting the shoulders let go. Next time, do this, but do it very slowly, just the smallest amount here I'll demonstrate. instead of going this, I just raise it just the smallest amount, and then I let it go.

And then again, just let them, the tension increased, let the shoulders move up towards the ears and let them go. It's incredible. It's the same on rush again, over the shoulders and down into the gut feeling of warmth from that very simple move. Exactly. what should really, people ask for, For me, the goal is feeling more alive, feeling more connected, feeling more present in the here and now. And, , again, this is energy that got locked in our bodies. And once we connect to that energy and release that energy, we feel a lot of this vitality. if you're willing to take one more step, I'm going to give you a sentence to say, if you're willing. I am.

His fingers would become ice cold. Then they would become warm. Then he would be able to take full, easy breaths. And then rhythmically breaths, full, easy breaths would come and go. And finally, at the end, you could just see he was sweating deeply that this shock had been discharged. And especially because, and the reason we later found out is when he was an army doctor and his battalion was ambushed and he, the only, everyone died, but he fell out of the truck backwards into a ditch on his back. And the horror and terror got locked into the back in the form of pain, physical pain. , , I could see people were deeply moved. I asked if anybody wanted to share something, if Chaim was with it, what they were noticing in their own experience, in their own bodies. And this one woman stood up after a while, elegant woman, and she said, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. This woman, she was from Gaza mental health.

Dan, thank you for that. Thank you for sharing that, for saying that. I appreciate that. I would imagine you're not alone. No, I don't think.

And it's unfortunate because many people, when they think of self-compassion, they associate self with selfishness and compassion with weakness. But the research really shows quite the opposite. People who are high in self-compassion are less self-absorbed and narcissistic than people who are low in self-compassion. They're generally more emotionally resilient, in other words, not weak. More motivated to achieve their goals, generally happier and healthier mentally and physically. And also self-compassionate people tend to have more compassionate, satisfying relationships with others. it's really got nothing to do with selfishness or weakness. What does self-compassion mean. An informal definition of self-compassion is when we suffer, treating ourselves with the same emotions, and we're not feeling we're doing anything in return for what we've done, or not feeling we're doing anything in return for what we've done, but we are doing the same kindness and understanding as we would treat a dear friend. And this is actually a radical act. Research by Kristin Neff shows that 68 of us are actually more compassionate to others than to ourselves. Only 6 of people are actually more compassionate to themselves than others. And the remaining 16 are about even. Self-compassion is also a humble entrepreneur Self-compassion is also a humble entrepreneur Self-compassion is also a humble entrepreneur We're really just including ourselves in the circle of compassion. We are not systematically excluding ourselves. And this has enormous ramifications in terms of health and -being, and not just for us, but also for others, as I mentioned. When Kristin developed the scale, her formal definition of self-compassion had three components, mindfulness, common humanity, and self-kindness. to be self-compassionate, we need to, number one, know we're struggling while we're struggling with some measure of acceptance, that's mindfulness. We can't be compassionate if we don't know we're struggling,. Part two, component two, is we need to feel kinship with others in the midst of our suffering. In other words, to see our suffering as part of the human experience, rather than isolating us. And we also need to have a warm and kind attitude toward ourselves. And this is the self-kindness aspect. we need all three components to have self-compassion. In Kristin's model, the opposite of mindfulness is compassion. Self-compassion is self-absorption, or over-identification or rumination. That's the opposite of mindfulness.",

They prefer the need to belong or the need to be appreciated, to be respected, to be included, to be connected. this is all fine. You can use whatever language feels. Just the other day, I saw a brand new study that showed that children as young as three years old will override their own preferences in terms of what activities they're doing in order to follow the norms of a group. already at three years old, children are behaving others. They want to follow the rules. This is instinctive in us through evolution. I personally the phrase, the wish to be loved, because it captures a deep primordial vulnerable need that we have. And actually to heal shame, we need to go to this vulnerable place. In other words, out of the conceptual and into the visceral. And we are all born with the wish to be loved. infants are incapable of doing much for themselves. We know this. When an infant is born, it can't do anything. It needs to be fed. It needs to be touched. It needs to be kept warm, food, clothing, shelter, touch, and on. It needs everything. how does an infant get its needs met. It's really quite simple. An infant gets somebody to love the child, to love it. And then everything flows naturally. Parents often throw themselves in front of a bus in order to protect their child, give their child what they need. Not always, of course. Some parents are not very good parents at all. But that's how children survive. They have others take care of them. that's the first thing. The second thing is that we need to be able to do something. with their first breath, not only are they inhaling in order to make the body survive, but they also have a wish. And that is love me.

    "text": "Hey, hi, everyone. My name is Jerry Wise. And I want to talk today about narcissistic parents, and why you always felt you are a burden to them. I've been working with individuals and families and couples for over 45 years. And I've been working hard to help them get their family of origin out of them, they can truly have a real self of their own. Today, I want to talk about, , why you always felt a burden to them. And that's very common, I hear from adult children of narcissistic parents. They just always feel a burden. They may always feel a burden to everyone, because they have been trained and programmed to feel a burden to all. Certainly, we felt a burden because our parents who should be nurturing, even anticipating our needs at times, and I don't mean being a helicopter parent, certainly all children have to tolerate a certain amount of, , discomfort or upsetness or not getting what they want. That's normal. We all have to go through that. But the narcissistic parent does not nurture the child's genuine developmental needs for attention, love, caring. And if they see anything that looks anything an adult, bad behavior, selfishness, which all children have, even toddlers are narcissistic. But that's developmentally appropriate. Even teenagers can be narcissistic and kind of caught up in their own world. That's developmentally appropriate. But if you're 35, and you're narcissistic, or caught up in just your own world, and don't care about anybody else, then that's not the thing to do. If you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, that's a mental illness, but not if you do it earlier in your life. And as parents, good parents want to tolerate that, they can move through that developmental process to greater health. And also when they practice that narcissism, they realize the world doesn't come to an end. And they become more calm and more accepting of, hey, wait a minute, this is a safe place to be in. And many times kids will test to see if this is a safe place.",

    "text": "many narcissistic parents fail at that test, because they believe their toddler should be a mini-adult, and their child should be definitely a mini-adult. If a child needs to be a mini-adult, when they become an adult, they'll be a mini-child. Something you might think about. A lack of empathy for your needs. They really don't. narcissistic parents are not. They don't have the empathetic gene. They don't. Your needs don't really matter. Only theirs do. They have conditional love. And certainly, they don't feel all your needs are worthy of love. Now, I may need to meet your needs that I look a good parent to someone else, or I dress you in a certain way others think I'm wealthy, or I'm a great parent, or whatever. But again, it's always about other people and or about them. It's not about your needs. Maybe you don't even want to dress that way, but that doesn't matter. What matters to them is how they feel they're going to be perceived. Not what your needs are, what you would. They will manipulate. There's a manipulation of your needs to get their needs met. They will manipulate your needs to get their needs met. And again, we feel. Our needs are just a burden to everyone. Me having needs is just burdening the whole universe. And I remember definitely feeling that way. Parentification, where we have a reversal of the parent-child roles. And parentification is the child becomes the parent. The parent becomes the child. And the parent under functions. you had to over function and there's no room left. For your needs. And if they're under functioning, you have to over functioning as a young person, or even as a young adult, even as an adult for your parents. I'm telling you, there's not going to be room for your needs. And I know many people who are middle-aged, who are taking care of parents, who actually are pretty healthy. They're all there mentally, though they may be narcissistic, but they spend all of their time still helping their parents. And again, their needs are ignored and are not met. They're still continuing that cycle from childhood. With narcissistic parents, there's a competition with your needs. Their needs should take up all of the oxygen in the room, not your needs. They also can project their need or neediness onto you.",

He beat all the kids. And then the next morning going, , your dad's having a hard time at work.

I think that happens often with either narcissists who are alcoholics or alcoholics who are not narcissists even, that don't you think mom's an alcoholic. And everybody's going, oh, no, no. No, she's not an alcoholic. And she has every symptom in the book of being an alcoholic. And you're supposed to believe that she's not. But she's having all kinds of difficulties and problems as a result of alcohol, alcohol ingestion and alcohol use and overuse. Thirdly, don't try to change others. Stop wasting your time trying to get the family to believe you're not the scapegoat. Or to not treat you a scapegoat. Focus on strengthening your emotional immune system. I don't care what you think. , let's use the example that everybody thinks mom is not an alcoholic, for example. And good and she is. I mean, it's just obvious. It's been obvious for years. And in fact, she's even gone for an assessment and been told she's an alcoholic. But the rest of the family, no, no, no. She just works hard. And she has a lot of stress. And, , and a lot of excuses. I don't have to change their view of it. I just have to hold on to my view of it. , I understand that's how you see it. But that's not how I see it. And as far as I know, it won't ever be different than how I see it. we're going to have problems or difficulties. I understand that. But, , I'm immune to your irrational way of seeing mom. I'm not going to. I'm not going to be overtaken by that. Or if they say, I don't know why you always cause trouble in the family. That's a scapegoat type of statement that you're always the one who's causing difficulties or you can't get along. , I'm sure that's how you perceive it because I've known you for a long time. If I'm talking to family members. However, I have never and I don't see it that way now. You're free to see it that way. I mean, they can still.

    "text": "They want the roles to remain the same and have the family look it's always looked and want everyone to act they have always acted and playing their part in the family. Number four. When narcissistic parents lose the scapegoat, they recruit replacements. The family must project their pain onto someone or something. They unconsciously play past the hot potato or to elect a new scapegoat. It may be the one who is the most sympathetic to the old scapegoat. It could even shift to the golden child. And I've seen that happen as. But they will recruit a new scapegoat because there's no place else to put the pain. They're not going to deal with their pain or take responsibility for their dysfunction or brokenness. it has to go somewhere. Think of the family a mobile. And I think if you were in junior high art or you might have made a mobile where you have all these wires and there may be papers stuck to each of the wires. And you would see this in different art forms. And you would see this in different art situations. And then if you pull on one of the pieces of paper, it shifts the whole mobile. And that's what happens when the scapegoat refuses to play the scapegoat and steps out of their role. It shifts the whole mobile. And of course, they don't that. The family doesn't that. They want things to continue as usual. And it shifts all of the branches. Number five. When narcissistic parents lose the scapegoat, they pull harder to get you back. And of course, of many ways a narcissist can try to pull you back. Love bombing, shaming, guilting, all kinds of ways they will try to pull you back in. I want to mention that in my Road to Self program, I do teach you how to calmly navigate resistance and pushbacks without getting pulled back in. Narcissistic parents will use shaming, love bombing, flying monkeys, gifs, even fake apologies, depression, mobbing, rage, even illnesses to pull you back in. Mary developed her plan for all of these contingencies by way of preparation. I have several people who have done this. She planned how she would respond to each of these moves.",

    "text": "And they don't express this anger in healthy, measured ways. No. They weaponize it. They lash out. They belittle. They demean. And it's not just manipulation anymore. It's aggression. Pure, unfiltered emotional violence. This is the kind of person who walks into a family gathering and poisons the atmosphere within minutes. They don't want connection. They want control. And when they feel that, they're ready to go. And when they feel that slipping, they explode. They insult their children. They pick fights with spouses. They undermine others' happiness simply because they no longer possess their own. Misery becomes a contagion they spread to maintain some sense of power. Now, here's the critical insight. Resentment is moral outrage in disguise. The narcissist believes they have been wronged. Not just by individuals, but by life itself. They see themselves as the overlooked genius. The unappreciated parent. The betrayed partner. But that story isn't rooted in reality. It's rooted in entitlement. And when entitlement meets decline, resentment is born. They begin to reinterpret the past through a lens of grievance. I gave everything, and look how I was repaid. No one ever truly appreciated me. Everyone just used me. These narratives aren't examined or questioned. They're accepted as gospel. And they fuel the anger. Every slight becomes constant. They're not just a form of self-pity. They're a form of self-pity. They're a form of self-love. They're a form of self-love. They're a form of self-love. They're a form of self-love. They're a form of self-love. They're a form of self-love. They're a form of self-love. They're a form of self-loathing. They're a form of self-loathing. They're a form of self-love. They're a form of self-loathing. They're a form of self-loathing. They're accepted as gospel. And they fuel the anger. Every slight becomes confirmation. Every disagreement. An attack. Every boundary set by another person is perceived as betrayal. And let's be honest, rage is seductive. Especially for someone who feels powerless. It gives them a temporary rush, a fleeting sense of strength. When they yell. People listen. When they explain. explode. Others recoil. For a moment, they're back in control. But it's a hollow victory, because what they don't realize is that every outburst corrodes the relationships they desperately need to survive. It's a slow social suicide. Burning one bridge at a time, while screaming that everyone else is to blame.",

Because if indeed you've got this difficult across the board, difficult with the teachers, difficult with you, difficult with peers, kind of kid, difficult in their part-time job, whatever, getting into a power struggle with them, you're going to lose it. You're not going to win because no one can win a power struggle with someone who's narcissistic. And with an adolescent, that's going to be even more amped up because they don't feel a sense of power because they're still living in your good graces and all of that. don't get into a power struggle. Basically, don't let the dishwasher be the hill you die on because it's really not worth it,. But it's because where narcissism is in adolescents, other bad behaviors are also likely to hang out, including things substance use. And what you really do want to watch for is actually keep more of an eye on, is your kid safe. How is their mental health functioning in other areas. If you are able to encourage therapy, that kid's probably going to say no, it's worth a shot. Definitely figure out what it is that does speak to them and cultivate their interest in that.

And it has to do with their pain. It has to do with their neurochemistry. It has to do with their coping mechanisms, their trauma, their dysfunction, their pain. It doesn't make it any easier when you're on the receiving end of it. But when you say and are able to just repeat, it literally has nothing to do with you. It has nothing to do with me. This is a very hurt and lost person who is coping with that hurt and that loss in an incredibly destructive way. But in no way, shape, or form does their bullshit determine whether or not I'm lovable, or whether or not I trust people, or whether or not I'm good enough. They have revealed, a very broken side of themselves, that they have chosen to escape, numb, deflect, all of it, instead of facing it in the mirror. And it's really hard because you got to go through a process of grieving what you thought it was in order to have yourself unhook from it. Because what you're actually grieving now, and I'm just going to, you haven't given me any details, but I'm just going to, , talk from my own experience. You're grieving the future that you thought was going to happen, and you're grieving the reality of what you thought was going on. And that's incredibly destabilizing. And you got to give yourself time, I'd say a year, to really just move through the anger, the pissed offness, the hurt, the how could they have done this. How could I not have seen this. How could they have lied. all of it. And then at some point, you're going to hit this saturation point, where you have soaked up much of the misery that you will no longer want to feel it.

Everybody deserves to be listed. this woman in this magic shop. She was a radiant being. She had a smile, a presence that made you feel safe. And this is a key psychological safety to downregulate your stress response. And she made me feel. She didn't look down on me. And I was 12 as a 12 year old. She looked at me. As an equal eye to eye.

I always tell people, never forget your own ability to change somebody's life. And also to recognize that oftentimes how somebody is interacting with you has nothing to do with what's going on. It has to do with the baggage they're carrying. And give people a benefit of a doubt. And , , if you grew up in a background mine, typically there are two paths.

I personally cry all the time for the same reason. And I don't think I've ever heard anybody explain why I feel driven to do what I do. thank you for that. That was a real gift to me to hear somebody explain why tears come up all the time and why I end this podcast every single time by telling the person who's listening that I love them.

No. And which is a very sad statement because, and we can talk about this, but many people, live in a fear mode all the time. And of course it has all sorts of deleterious effects. And being in a love mode or a heart centered mode is very difficult, especially if you have all sorts of challenges that distract you from who you really are.

You can then start to create the list of characteristics that you would expect of the greatest people who would come into your life. you have a list of hard nose, but then you also have a list of this is what I would expect of the best people, people that might not even know who I am to represent and bring into my life. Once you have that list, you then have to look at how do I spend my time. And do I spend my time that's in alignment with this list. Because if you don't have great people in your life, it might be because you aren't living in the same value set as the people that you want to bring in your life. of course, you're never going to want to spend time with you. When I first started wanting to spend time with Elena Cardone, I realized that if she hung out with me for a day, I would have to tell her and talk to her about things that I was interested in and things that I was doing at the time. I wasn't working out consistently. I didn't hold myself accountable to goals that I was setting. I was wishy-washy about what I did or didn't want for my future. I wasn't able to clearly communicate the personal goals that I had for myself. And I spent six months becoming the type of person that Elena would want to be friends with. that when I did have the opportunity to meet her, to spend time around her, we had similar shared interests. When she wanted to go to the gym on the very first trip that we took together, I wasn't embarrassed by how out of shape I was because I had already started to go to the gym. you have your list of the things that you want. And when it comes to the list of things that you don't want, here's the challenge. When it comes to the things that you don't want and the boundaries that you were setting, where you would kick somebody out of your life for violating those boundaries, it can be incredibly difficult to draw a hard line.",

Next is number two, which is that your emotions are making you sound reactive and unsure. We have a saying around here, high emotion, low intelligence. Have you ever noticed that people who are wildly emotional. Always talking about what's wrong and being outrageously creative in their storytelling. Very rarely have a lot of success around them. They don't have people who are winning around them. They don't have successful business relationships. They don't have successful businesses because the more you use emotion, the less you're using logic. Emotion just clouds your decision-making ability and effective leaders are spectacular. They are gangsters at being able to take a situation. Remove emotion and be able to logically make decisions very quickly. And they trust their decision-making process. The only way you can trust your decision-making process is if you have your own internal confidence that you're not being swayed by something based off of the emotion that you have. You're actually being swayed based off of logic, based off of data. Just this week, I had somebody hop off on me and had this whole emotional outburst. It was embarrassing. And it instantly reduced my confidence. Their inability to feel something, to experience something, to have there be a form of rejection in front of them and be able to handle that with grace, understanding, questions, allowed me to see this person through a very new lens. And that new lens is they make decisions based off of their emotion. And as I looked a little bit further into this, I actually started to see how there was a lack of success in a variety of different areas, which is a key indicator that emotion is used in all sorts of conversations. And instead of creating confidence, it actually erodes people's confidence, which means you cannot be successful because without other people as a leader, you're not successful. You actually cannot, by definition, be a leader if other people don't trust and actually follow you. never let your emotions override your message. One of the visuals I use to help me during emotional situations is I imagine myself being a blade of grass. Follow me on this one.",

They speak with weight. What about what you're saying actually matters. When you think of every conversation you're in as an opportunity for you to make an impact, you will show up to those conversations differently. Any meeting that you're attending, any conversation you're a part of, it has to matter because as a leader, you have a million things pulling at your attention. There are no shortage of things on your to-do list. Emails that you could be answering, presentations that you could be making, but instead you're in that room for a reason. If you recognize that you have nothing to say and there's no reason for you to be there, leave that conversation. A leader knows where their time is best spent and they prioritize accordingly. whenever I walk into a room, I know the reason I'm going into that room. I ask myself, what is my target.",

Great leaders know that there are a plethora of problems for them to solve and their time is going to be spent solving the most important problem. Therefore their attention and their communication of where they are truly does matter. if you're struggling with authority, reevaluate where you're spending your time. Go into the meetings where you do choose to participate and actually participate. Have a point of view. Use your authority because you've thought through the situation and that there's a problem and there's something that you can help with or you need to better understand as a way for you to build up your own authority in your mind. Leaders matter. They drive initiatives forward. never enter a room where you don't know why you're there and you will all of a sudden have more authority in your communication simply because you took a handful of minutes in order to really get there. You need to be able to understand why your time was best spent there. When participating and leading meetings, you steer the conversation with clear, confident delivery. Next up is number four, which is to become a question master. You do not need all the answers to lead. You just need to know how to ask the questions. The best leaders put themselves in a position to solve the most complicated problems in a business. And in order to solve a complicated problem, there has to be some sort of a clear, clear answer. There has to be some level of constraint, some level of confusion, and no clear path forward. if you are an effective communicator, you are able to address and properly identify what questions you need to ask, what information is missing to be able to make the best decision to move that problem forward.

    "text": "There's a unique kind of pain that comes from being betrayed by the people who are supposed to protect you, love you, and stand by your side. When family, those we trust, the most turns against us, it shakes the foundation of everything we believe in. Let's take a deep breath together. This is not an easy conversation, but it's a necessary one. Because if you felt this betrayal, if you've carried this weight in your heart, I want you to know that you are not alone. The pain of being betrayed by family is not just emotional, it's physical, psychological, and deeply spiritual. It sits heavy in the chest, making it hard to breathe, hard to trust, hard to understand how someone who was supposed to love you could hurt you profoundly. And here's the thing, this pain isn't something you can just get over because someone tells you to or because time passes. It lingers in the quiet moments, in the holidays where their absence is louder than their presence ever. It's not something you can just get over because someone tells you to or because time passes. And yet, often, when we express our pain, we're met with dismissal. That's just how they are. Family is family. You should let it go. But this pain is real. It has weight. And it matters because you matter. The betrayal you experience isn't some minor inconvenience or something you imagine is a wound. And wounds, when ignored, don't heal. They fester. They deepen. And they end. They impact how we see ourselves, how we see others, and how we move through the world. Acknowledging the pain is the first step in reclaiming your to heal, to grieve, and to honor what was lost. When you are betrayed by family, it doesn't just hurt, it changes you. Because family is where we are supposed to be safe, where we learn love, where we develop our first understanding of trust and belonging. when that space is no longer safe, when the people who were supposed to protect you, become the ones who wound you, it can leave you questioning everything. You wonder if love is real, if trust is even possible, if you will ever feel truly at home anywhere. That kind of pain doesn't just go away with time.",

Because this isn't just about one incident, one lie, one betrayal. It's about the ripple effect it has on your entire sense of self. To ignore this pain, to pretend it's not significant, is to ignore a piece of your own heart that is crying out for care, for understanding, for validation. The pain demands to be felt, not because it's comfortable, but because feeling it is the only way to move through it. And yet, the world doesn't always give us the space to name this pain. There's this unspoken rule that family wounds should be endured in silence. That blood ties me near. That love is not a thing of forgiveness without accountability. That loyalty should override self-respect. But here's the truth being, hurt by family doesn't make you weak. Acknowledging that hurt doesn't make you ungrateful, it makes you human. And if we don't allow ourselves to sit with this pain, to acknowledge its depth, we carry it forward in ways we don't even realize. It shows up in our hesitation to trust, in our fear of abandonment, in the way we minimize our own needs to avoid conflict. This is why it matters. Because this pain is real, and if we don't give it the space to be seen, it doesn't just disappear, it embeds itself into the fabric of our being. But when we allow ourselves to say, this hurt me, without justification, without self-blame, we take the first step in honoring our own experience. And that is the foundation of healing not, ignoring the pain, not silencing it, but recognizing that it is real, and because it is real. are you. When betrayal comes from family, one of the first instincts is to turn inward, searching for an explanation that makes sense. Maybe if I had been quieter, maybe if I had tried harder, maybe if I had been more patient, more loving, more forgiving, then they wouldn't have done what they did. This is what we do when we're hurt. We try to find the reason, and more often than not, we place the blame on ourselves.",

    "text": "Because if it's our fault, then maybe we could have controlled it, maybe we could have prevented it, maybe we can fix it. But the truth is, family betrayal isn't about you. It's about them, their choices, their patterns, their inability to show up in a way that honors love and trust. You could have done everything , and it still wouldn't have changed the way they treated you. Their betrayal was never a reflection of your worth. It was a reflection of their wounds, their shortcomings, their inability to love in the way you deserve. Holding yourself responsible for their actions only keeps you trapped in a cycle of self-blame. And that is not a weight you were meant to carry. There is something deeply unfair about the way we are conditioned to believe that family dynamics should be tolerated no matter the harm they cause. When a family member betrays you, whether through lies, manipulation, neglect, or outright cruelty there, is often an expectation that you should simply accept it, forgive, and move on. But let's be clear. Forgiveness does not erase accountability. And being hurt by family does not mean you were the problem. Some people are not. Some people are wrapped up in their own dysfunction that they project their pain onto the ones closest to them. They may have been hurt themselves. They may be repeating toxic cycles they never had the courage to break. But none of that is your burden to bear. You are not responsible for their healing, for their growth, for their choices. And no matter how much you love someone, no matter how deeply you wish things could be different, you cannot force someone to treat you with kindness, respect, and care. That is a choice they must make. And if they chose betrayal instead, that is on them, not on you. And yet the guilt lingers. It whispers, maybe I should have tried one more time. Maybe I'm expecting too much. Maybe this is just how family is. But here's the thing. Family should never be a place where you have to shrink yourself to be accepted. You should not have to earn the to be treated with basic dignity. And yet when betrayal happens, we second guess our own experience, because society tells us that family should be untouchable, that blood is thicker than boundaries.",

    "text": "But that narrative is a lie. Love is what makes a family not share DNA, not force loyalty, not suffering in silence. And love, real love, does not betray, manipulate, or wound. It nurtures, protects, and honors. If someone in your family failed to do that, it was not because you were unworthy of love. It was because they were incapable of giving up. It was because they were unable to do what you wanted them to do. And , when you're in a situation where you're not giving up, you're not giving up on the fact that you're not giving it in the way you deserve. Let that truth settle in. Let it sink past the shame, past the self-doubt, past the lies that told you this was somehow your fault. Because it never was. There is a deep longing in all of us to make things , to fix what's broken, to return to the place of our deepest wounds and somehow rewrite the story. When family betrays us, that longing can be overwhelming. They're not just a victim. They're a victim of a patient who is not even a patient. A patient who has been hurt and is not able to change. Maybe they'll see what they did and make it. But healing doesn't happen in the same space where the hurt was created. You cannot find peace in a battlefield still littered with unspoken resentment manipulation and cycles of dysfunction that refuse to break. You cannot build wholeness in an environment that refuses to acknowledge the damage that was done. And yet, the love we deserve will finally show up. But here's the truth. Love does not require suffering. Healing does not come from continuously exposing yourself to the same pain, waiting for it to stop. Healing requires distance, perspective, and the courage to step away from what is familiar but harmful. Walking away doesn't mean you don't love them. It doesn't mean you don't wish things could be different. It means you are choosing yourself and that is one of the hardest bravest things you will ever do. Because the world has conditioned us to believe that loyalty means endurance, that family means unconditional access, that love means staying no matter the cost.

Because the people who hurt you may never acknowledge their role in your pain. They may never offer the apology you deserve. And if you stay waiting for them to change, waiting for the wounds to close in the same place they were inflicted, you may never experience the kind of healing that allows you to breathe freely again. Healing begins when you decide that your peace is more important than their expectations. But stepping away is terrifying, isn't it. Because even in the pain, even in the betrayal, there is familiarity and sometimes we confuse familiarity with something that is not familiar. And that is what we call a safety. We tell ourselves that it's better to endure the known pain than risk the unknown, than risk being alone. But the truth is you have already been alone in the worst way alone in your pain, alone in your silence, alone in the moments when you were hurting and they didn't care enough to see it. The real loneliness is not in leaving. It's in staying in a place where your pain is ignored, where your boundaries are disrespected, where your worth is constantly questioned. asks you to step into discomfort. It asks you to grieve what should have been while making space for what could be. It asks you to trust that there is a version of you on the other side of this sin who is no longer defined by the hurt, no longer stuck in the cycle, no longer waiting for people who have already shown you who they are. Forgiveness is one of the most misunderstood concepts when it comes to healing from betrayal, especially when that betrayal comes from family. People will tell you that forgiveness means opening the door again, giving them another chance, sitting at the same table with the same people who broke you. But let's be clear, forgiveness is for you, not them. Forgiveness is about releasing the hold that resentment has on your heart, about freeing yourself from the weight of replaying the betrayal over and over again in your mind.",

Forgiveness does not erase the need for boundaries. It does not demand that you go back to a place where you were disrespected, manipulated, or harmed. What it does is allow you to reclaim your own peace to say, I will not carry this pain any longer. I will not let what they did define me. But choosing to forgive does not mean you are obligated to let them back in. You can wish them healing from a distance. You can release the anger without reopening the door. And yet, there is much pressure to reconcile, especially when it comes to family. People will tell you that you should just let it go, that life is short, that family is everything. But what they fail to understand is that reconciliation requires two people. It requires effort, accountability, and a genuine willingness to make things. It is not something you can force on your own. You cannot be the only one doing the work, the only one trying to rebuild trust, the only one willing to acknowledge the pain that was caused. And here's the hard truth. Some people don't change. Some people will never take responsibility for the damage they caused. Some people will continue to operate from a place of denial, manipulation, or selfishness. And no amount of your forgiveness will change that. And when people tell you that forgiveness and reconciliation are the same thing, they are asking you to prioritize keeping the peace over, protecting yourself. But forgiveness is an internal process. Reconciliation is a choice, and it is a choice that should only be made when there is evidence that the person who hurt you has done the work to earn their place in your life again. This is where many of us struggle because we have been conditioned to believe that if we do not reconnect, we are somehow holding onto bitterness, that we are being too harsh, that we are shutting people out.

And that decision isn't cruel at self-respect. Forgiveness is an act of personal freedom. It is about unburdening yourself, about making peace with the past that it no longer controls your future. But letting go of the pain does not mean inviting back the person who caused it. And if someone has not shown you with their actions, that they have done, that they have done, that they are not willing to let go of the pain, that they are not willing to let go of the pain, that they have changed, if they have not demonstrated a real commitment to being different, then reconciliation is not only unnecessary, it's unsafe. You deserve to heal without being pulled back into the very environment that broke you. And that is not unforgiveness, that is wisdom. One of the hardest truths to accept is that family is not always the people you were born toits, the people you choose, the people who choose you. For long, we've been told that blood is thicker than water, that family is forever, that no matter what they do, we must stand by them. But what happens when family becomes the source of your deepest wounds, when the people who were supposed to love you unconditionally are the ones who betrayed your trust, dismissed your pain, or made you feel small. Staying tied to people who hurt you, simply because of shared DNA, is not love at its obligation. And obligation is not a foundation for belonging. Belonging happens when you are seen, valued, and accepted for who you truly are. It happens when the people in your life hold space for you, respect your boundaries, and love you without conditions. And sometimes the people who can do that best are not the ones you share a last name with. Sometimes family is the friend who listens without judgment, the mentor who guides you with kindness, the community that lifts you up when your own bloodline tears you down. Choosing your family is an act of self-respect.",

And yet, many of us hesitate to walk away from harmful family dynamics because we fear what it means to be without them. We wonder, if I let go, will I be alone. But here's the truth. You are not losing family. You are making space for the people to enter your life. You are creating room for love that is real, for relationships that are reciprocal, for connections that don't demand that you shrink yourself to fit someone else's expectations. This is not betrayal. This is not selfishness. This is choosing to build a life where you are surrounded by people who choose you back not out of duty, not out of obligation, but out of genuine care, respect, and love. Because real family isn't about who shares your blood. It's about who shows up, who supports you, who supports you. Who holds your heart with care. And yet, breaking away from the idea that family must be tied to genetics is one of the most challenging and courageous things you will ever do. Society doesn't teach us that we have a choice when it comes to family. It tells us to endure, to make peace, to tolerate. But what if peace isn't found in enduring dysfunction. What if peace is found in knowing that you deserve better. That you are allowed to create a family that feels home, that fills you with warmth, that doesn't require you to constantly prove your worth. When you stop chasing approval from people who refuse to see you, when you stop trying to heal in relationships that continuously harm you, you open the door to something greater. You get to build a new definition of family one, rooted in love, respect, and mutual care. And that is not something you have to earn. That is something you are worthy of simply because you exist. When betrayal comes from the people who are supposed to protect you, it can feel an ending, the chapter you thought would hold love and safety has been torn apart, leaving only emptiness behind.",

    "text": "You start to wonder if this is all there is, if the pain, the disappointment, the loneliness will define the rest of your life. But let me tell you something, your story is not over. This moment, no matter how heavy, no matter how unbearable, is just a page. And pages turn. Pain has a way of convincing us that we are stuck, that we will always be the person who was hurt, that we will never be able to move beyond what happened. But your past is not a life sentence. What they did to you does not get to decide the person you become. Yes, the wounds are real. Yes, the loss is real. But is your resilience. is your ability to rise, to rewrite, to rebuild. You are not meant to stay trapped in this chapter forever. And even if now all you can see is the pain, I promise you there is more waiting for you on the other side. The hardest part of healing is believing that a future exists beyond the heartbreak. Because when family wounds you, it shakes the foundation of everything you believed about love, trust, and connection. It makes you question your own worth, your ability to be loved, your ability to belong anywhere at all. But listen to me, what they did is not the whole story. They may have shaped a part of your journey, but they do not get to define the rest of it. You do. You fast. And you will find yourself challenging, just mapping out all the different ways. Everything can Yu listening to say what's going on with you yet doesn't provide a profound Maisie sentence. But people simply can't make the resume. And that's how you carry this pain. You get to decide whether this betrayal becomes a permanent weight or a lesson that fuels your strength. And I know it's not fair. You didn't ask for this. You didn't deserve this. But you are still here. And that means there is still time. Time to heal. built around the hurt but around the strength you found because of it. But here's the thing, healing isn't about forgetting what happened. It's not about pretending the pain didn't exist or trying to erase the past. It's about learning how to hold your own story with compassion instead of shame.",

Now let me give you another reason why people sabotage. And it's what we refer to as pain confusion. And it's thinking, being confused about pain, thinking that bad pain is actually a good thing. some people grow up where they are made to think that love equals pain. And in order to have true love, I need to be in pain. let's sabotage relationships there's pain in. The relationship, pain, confusion, others pain is their normal all their life. They haven't been able to resolve pain. They've lived in pain. And what they don't realize is when something becomes your normal, there's a certain comfort to it. There's something very familiar that just helps you feel, this is good. And that can happen for some people. We're not going to be able to do it. But we can do it when it comes to pain. And then another one is a person who's a cutter or a self-harm person. It releases the body's natural opioids and it makes you feel better. pain makes you feel better. if good things are happening, let's self-harm and that'll make us feel better. Pain confusion. Others from, I don't know, I don't know. Complex trauma have shut down their emotions much that they just feel dead inside, empty inside. And they need some pain to feel alive. let's sabotage because I don't know how to experience and enjoy positive emotions. I just feel dead all the time. But the only thing that makes me feel alive is when I am in pain. Pain confusion. Others, pain is something I can control. Again, the cutter thinks that. let's sabotage stuff and create pain because I can manage pain. For others, I've got much guilt, I need to create pain in order to get justice. I need to punish myself in order to get justice. I need to inflict pain on myself in order to get justice. Pain confusion there. And then for some, pain gets me attention. I hate pain, but I pain because everybody is empathetic towards me and looks up to me. And that becomes the martyr complex that some people have.",

    "text": "When I first started working in the counseling world 30 years ago, what was being talked about all the time was you got to love yourself. Low self-esteem was on everybody's radar and you got to love yourself. But what they were saying was you have to try to create feelings of love for yourself. And what I found in working with people with tons of shame, they couldn't stir up good feelings to themselves. if they went to a workshop and they said, look in the mirror and tell yourself you love you and feel all warm and fuzzy to yourself, they're going rolling their eyes going, who is this quack job that's running this class. Because I, can't stir up any positive feelings. And I said, for deeply shamed people, that does not work initially. Where they have to start is not try to get warm feelings to themselves. They have to start by saying, I accept me. I choose to accept the body I was given. I choose to accept the personality I was given. And what does shame say. I don't want to be the guy who's the first one to accept me. I choose to accept the other. I don't want to be the guy who's the first one to accept me. And what does shame say. I don't who I am because I think that's the reason I've been neglected and abandoned. I wish I wasn't a shy, quiet person. I wish I was the outgoing leader that was funny all the time. And you wished for a different personality. You wished for a different face and all those different things. You start by making a choice. I choose to accept this package. I choose to accept the way I was born. Now that is easier said than done because you've never done that before. And what's going to happen is once you start to want to get down on yourself because you're feeling your shyness and nobody's wanting to talk to you because you want to sit in the corner all by yourself. You go, what. I'm shy. Instead of seeing that as just a negative, I wonder if there's positives from being shy. And you think about it from a positive perspective. let me give you this. When I was young, I was super shy. I was super analytical.",

And that is the thing that makes up a co-dependent relationship. then what happens when a child has a dad who's a narcissist. Dad is all about his own needs and when the kid has a need, what does dad say to the kid. Quit being selfish. And he makes the child feel bad for having a need. He makes the child feel guilty for having a need. now the child feels shame because dad's abusing them and not giving them attention. And they conclude it must be my fault. I must not be lovable. I must not be good enough. And then dad says you're selfish for having needs. that's a double whammy far that comes out of that narcissist. One way to look at a definition of what is shame, it is the dis-ease of self. And what that means is you're not comfortable in your own skin. You don't yourself. You're uneasy with who you are. And as a result of that, you don't have any positive feelings about yourself. many of you can go back in your mind to childhood and remember many days sitting on the swing or in your room feeling no positive feelings to yourself. Hating yourself. Feeling unlovable, not valuable, the shame piece. the child then is going, their brain is going, I don't want to stay in these painful feelings. What do I need to do to fix it. here's what you have to understand next. The brain doesn't go, I need to fix my inside because it's concluded my inside is bad. where is the solution going to come from. I don't have any positive feelings about myself. the only way I can feel good about myself is if others have positive feelings towards me. And then I'll piggyback on their positive feelings towards me. There is where codependency begins. You are looking outside yourself to make yourself feel better as a way to deal with your shame without dealing with it internally. This solution will never work.

If you don't know me, I went to even before I was born when I was in my mom's womb. I went to minimum of five times a week ever since I was a newborn. I was raised in and I was raised in kind of the normal teachings of Western society. I bought into all of that until I became very ill and I went into a deep depression that lasted almost ten years. And all of a sudden, all of those things that I was taught didn't work. And I had to back away from the that I was raised with and go, most of that I don't believe anymore, it doesn't work. I need to find out what works. And that caused me to reread the through the eyes of pain and the eyes of depression and the eyes of unresolved physical problems. And all of a sudden the took on a whole new meaning to me. Because I saw it through the eyes that the original recipients of the read it from. Do you realize that the wasn't written for people in comfortable places. It was written for people who were in pain. And as you read it, all of a sudden, everything you see differently. And one of the first things I began to see was we've misunderstood 's anger. And we've used 's anger in an abusive way that never designed. the first part of 's anger is what I call passive anger. here's how it works. Sometimes when it's passive, someone says is angry at people. It doesn't mean he's up there saying, oh, I just want to get them. What it means is this. When he designed life, he says, I am going to create life that if you live within the boundaries of love in a healthy design, you're going to get positive consequences. You're going to experience positive emotions, positive relationships, and many blessings. If you step outside of those boundaries and start to lie and start to be abusive, guess what you're going to get. Pain. Now that's the first way of describing 's anger is nothing more than the natural consequences that built into unloving actions.",

But if I get back inside of healthy, I'll get back to joy and. actually, negative consequences that feel is angry are actually loving you, saying, I don't want you out here because it'll destroy you. I want to make this super uncomfortable you'll come back to what I designed. all of that pain comes out of a loving heart. that's not even anger. That's a loving trying to stop people from destroying themselves. that's the first thing you need to understand. if you now read through the , and you read every time you see 's anger, guess what you're going to see most of the time. It's nothing more than painful consequences that are built into life. Now let me take that further. In Romans 1, there's a passage that says, people step outside of 's design, and they basically said, we're not going to submit to , surrender to. We want to be our own boss, we're going to do it our way. We think 's rules are designed to take the fun out of life. We think fun is outside of 's design, we're going to go out there. And they did that, and they got pain. But instead of going back to inside, it says they hardened their heart, and they got more rebellious. And many of you understand that. And they said, we're going to go even further outside of 's design, because we think there'll be happiness there. And it says gave them up. He says, I don't want you to do that. I'm trying to bring you back through painful consequences. You're hardening your heart, I'll let you go.

And if you can't find a helpless driver going down Portage Ave or something else to get angry at, you go push buttons on people and you start to pick fights you can vent your anger. And that's how deep the anger has become. Next one, anger at yourself. we tend to think that anger is something that we direct outward at situations that aren't or that people that are jerks. But when you come out of complex trauma, a good part of your anger is directed at yourself. And that can come from guilt. That can come from shame. That can come from all kinds of different things. But there's a ton of anger that has never been. That has never been resolved towards yourself. let me give you the questions that I would ask a group of React clients on their Tuesday morning with Tim. Scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being absolute, none, zero, next to nothing. 10 being crazy, high, through the roof. How much anger was in your family of origin.

And they might not even be aware of what we're doing. what I have found with a lot of people. Is that they are pros at underhanding. They just don't realize because they've never thought about it. Or been aware of it. And as they become aware of it. Along with stuffing it and anger turned inward. They go, I've got anger problems. Because I am angry about a lot of things. I just never explode. But it comes out very effectively in other ways. , now let me bring in the complex trauma. Which is the cause of the lava. where does that lava, that bubbling away deep down inside of you. And has been for many, many years. Where did it come from. this is the key point that I want you to understand. Anger was originally designed to be a good thing. Now that sounds strange to somebody from complex trauma. Because anger was always bad. Anger never led to anything good. It only led to more pain. And it's hard to believe or even think. That anger might be a good thing. In certain situations. here's how anger was designed to work. In us, we have this built in. Without even realizing it. Moral system of what is love. And we know that if you love somebody. And want a healthy relationship. You have to be honest. You have to be reliable. You have to be faithful. You have to communicate. You have to respect each other. You have to be consistent and fair. That's built in. It's into our DNA. if somebody lies. What do we do. We get angry. And what the anger is saying is. Alert, alert, alert. Something is wrong here. That should not continue. Because if it continues. It will damage this relationship. And it will damage each other. anger was designed. Number one. To alert you. That something was either. Unloving. Disrespectful. Unfair. And not true. And then the second thing.",

It resolves it. And then the anger goes away. There's no more need for it. Because it is resolved. that's the original design. And what helps that whole system. Is that when you are. Angry. Your brain releases a chemical. Called cortisol. And that chemical is only released. With anger and fear. Slash stress. Danger. Cortisol is the chemical. That gives you the adrenaline rush. It gives you extra energy. It makes you hyper focused. And it is saying. This has to get fixed. This has to get resolved. And it's giving you. All the help possible. To have the energy. And the desire. To resolve this. To return it to love. what happens in complex trauma. You live with stuff not being fair. You live with lies. And secrets. You live with unfaithfulness. And lack of consistency. And disrespect. And you're getting angry all the time. As a kid. Because you're getting hurt. Your needs aren't being met. You're trying to resolve it. And you get angry.

    "text": "Kids growing up in complex trauma, when they begin to realize everybody's angry, but nobody's using it to create loving relationships, to fix problems, they start taking notes on other uses of anger. And they begin to adopt those uses in their own life. Because they find that anger is an amazing way to create love and to create peace. And that anger is an amazing shield, and an amazing weapon. It enables them to accomplish a lot of things that they normally wouldn't be able to accomplish. quickly, let me give you some of the misuses of anger that develop within complex trauma that probably you have picked up. some of these you can check off. And if you check off all of them, you need to come to the rest of the sessions. number one, many realize that when you come up in complex trauma, you have a lot of anger, but you're afraid of angry people. They scare you. you go, if I want to manipulate people, I should get angry. And they're going to be afraid of me. And they're going to give me whatever I want. They're going to say, just do whatever you want. Just don't be angry. And you've won. And that can go even further. Anger is not just good for manipulation. Through intimidation, it's good for control. many families of complex trauma, the thing that kept the kids somewhat in line was not that they were loved. It was they're afraid of dad's anger. fear of anger becomes a control technique. Then you realize anger is also a medication. When I'm feeling angry, I'm not feeling pain. When I'm feeling pain, when I'm feeling angry, I'm not feeling my hurt. if I get angry, I want to quickly go to, or if I get hurt and in emotional pain, I quickly want to go to anger because that shuts everything else down. And I don't feel those other emotions. Take that a little bit further. What happens for a lot of people is that they realize early on that there's certain characteristics or emotions that are causing them to feel hurt. And that's the thing that gets them to feel hurt. Because it's not just about anger. It's about the fact that they're not feeling pain. It's about the fact that they're not feeling pain.",

It's about the fact that they're not feeling pain. if I show embarrassment, or if I show fear, I get laughed at and picked on. what you learn to do, as soon as you feel embarrassment, you quickly switch to anger. I would suspect, and I ask clients this all the time at REACT, how many of you, when you're embarrassed, within two seconds you're angry. And almost everybody puts their hand up. Because you've learned to cover, weak emotions with anger that you don't feel it. Next, for many people growing up in complex trauma, healthy boundaries were not in existence. you said no to your parents and they didn't care. They just still did what they want. They came into your room, etc. what children learn, or just again know inherently, intrinsically, is I need space. But nobody's giving me space. how do I create it. Isolate. , in a family with people that don't let you isolate, that doesn't work. option two, explode. anger becomes the way of creating boundaries. And the problem with that is that once you get angry, then you feel guilty afterwards. And then you say, sorry, everybody come back in my room and walk all over me. And then you get tired of that again, you explode again. And you start this yo-yo effect where you're trying to create a boundary, but then taking it down. Next one, anger is a great way to hurt people that have hurt us. And it becomes a weapon. Next one, anger gives us energy. I sometimes ask people, how many of you to get angry before you clean the house. And they say yes, because now I clean the house and I do a great job. Because I am angry. And , when you get angry, anger gives you energy. Some people get angry in the morning if they're feeling a bit flat or down or low energy, because that gets them going. it has a purpose there. Others want to stay angry because it keeps their edge. It keeps them sharp. It keeps them alert to danger, to jerks out there. And their fear is if I let my anger die, I might get hurt. I might drop my guard too much. And it's a bad example.",

And it keeps me from everything else. I'm not angry because I have the strength to be angry. I'm not angry because I have the strength to be angry. I have the strength to be angry. I'm not angry because I'm angry. ever having to look at myself honestly. And it creates a feeling that I'm in the and you're in the wrong, which gives that self-righteous justice feeling. again, another purpose for anger. Many or most or maybe all of people that have complex trauma who haven't been able to resolve it have reached a point where they go, how do I not get hurt by this person anymore. their only way to not get hurt is to close their heart shut to that other person. But then the question is, what do I need to enable me to want to close my heart and keep it shut. Turn my anger into a resentment. Because once it's a resentment, I have no trouble closing it. I'm closing my heart. And again, it's a self-protective shield that many people use in order to protect their heart. Another one for many people is it's your identity. I have had clients say that when they were young or in the problem, they were respected because everybody feared their anger. That became their identity. It's what gave them value, prestige, power. And they said, if I let my anger go, who am I. Am I going to end up being a weakling, a softie. I don't know if I can endure that. that's another purpose. We already talked about it's a way of avoiding looking at yourself. You're always focused on how everybody else has done you wrong. And for many people, that leads to, I don't need help. I'm not going to reach out for help. Everybody else needs help, but I don't. Anger allows you to justify that kind of feeling. that was quite a few things. I don't know how many you checked. Maybe you were afraid to start that exercise.",

And if you hang on to anger, you open yourself up to negative forces that you weren't expecting. And they can take you to worse places. And then in verse 32, this is all in the last few verses of this chapter, get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander. what he, the word he's using for anger is again that lashing out on cruel anger. And he is saying, you should be the type of person who is not harsh or saying hurtful things, but they're marked by a love that people take notice of. make that your goal. Then in James, and James is considered to be the Proverbs of the New Testament, wisdom stuff, he says this, understand this, my dear brothers and sisters, you must all be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get anger. Now what is it that most of us, most of us do. We're quick to speak, quick to get angry, and slow to listen. he says, let's reverse that. Let's start with being quick to listen. And if you're quick to listen, all of a sudden, your anger is going to be less, your speech is going to be a lot better, because you're not going to say a lot of hurtful things. the starting point is to start listening more than letting your anger make you act out. again, he then adds this, human anger does not produce the righteousness desires. what we said in the first part is this, the original design by of anger was that, was take you to the righteousness desires. But what he's saying is human anger takes you to the opposite place. And you need to be very aware that your anger can either be good anger or bad, and watch out for the bad. , now let me take you to Proverbs. And I love this, because again, what you're going to see is that Solomon in writing Proverbs had this amazing insight into human nature and into anger. I'm going to give you a whole slew of verses.",

But he says, first of all, in chapter 29, Fools vent their anger, wise people quietly hold it back. What he is saying there is, what he is saying this is not that wise people stuff their anger, but wise people learn how to regulate and manage their anger. Fools don't. They just let it out. And they don't care who gets hurt with the shotgun blast of their anger. Then in chapter 19, sensible people control their temper. again, it's all about emotional regulation. That wisdom brings with it the ability to manage powerful emotions. And anger is one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful emotion. you don't get real good wisdom until you learn how to manage that powerful emotion called anger. if you do, you earn respect for managing that. But with that, you learn to pick your battles wisely. And you learn to overlook some things that aren't really a big deal. Whereas an angry person, they get angry about every little thing. And they don't overlook anything because everything accelerates their anger. a wise person learns what to get angry about, and then to manage their anger. And then in chapter 16, He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty. And he who rules his spirit is better than he who takes the city. what he is describing is mighty soldiers. An army that are able to swoop in with great power and conquer a city. And what he is saying is if you can control anger, you're actually stronger than those men. They've got physical strength. But a person who can control their anger has an emotional strength. That exceeds any type of physical strength. that is what your goal should be. That is what makes you truly great. Not physical strength. And then this one is very important for people from complex trauma to think about. Chapter 22. Don't befriend angry people. In other words, put boundaries up. Why. Or next one. Don't associate with hot-tempered people. Or you will learn to be them. In other words, you hang around angry people, it's going to rub off. It's going to influence you. But then it goes further.",

It is what the other person wants that comes first. This life trap is also known as the subjugation life track. you've always felt subjugated to the needs of others, the desires of others. I need to say up front, there is a healthy people pleasing. I think children come into the world with a desire to please, and it comes from a very innocent, pure place. We're not talking about healthy people pleasing. We're talking about unhealthy people pleasing. Healthy people pleasing always comes from the motive of pure love, and it always has boundaries. Your needs matter just as much as mine. I will sometimes say no to your requests when you want me to please them, and it goes against my other priorities. It goes against my values. It goes against taking care of my family. It goes against my children. It goes against my family. It goes against my children. It goes against my family. It goes against my family. I don't care about myself properly. people pleasing that's healthy always has boundaries and comes from the motive.

I am taking care of you more than I'm taking care of me. Your needs matter more than my needs. that is what we're going to be looking at today. It is important to understand that. And part of why I want to emphasize that is because this life trap for many people is very hard to identify as a negative thing. They see themselves as a loving, good person who just wants to help others. They haven't looked at their motive truly or accurately. They just think they want to help others. They're eager to please. They're usually liked by most everybody. They're easy to get along with. They're proud of their ability to be there for others. Also, many have trouble seeing it as negative because they look at their lives and they do a lot of good. They help a lot of people and a lot of causes.",

You feel that you lack integrity because you accommodate people too much and don't take care of yourself. somehow you see you lack integrity there. People tell you that you're not aggressive or ambitious enough. they're constantly saying you're too passive. You should stand up for yourself more. You play down your own accomplishments. You have trouble being strong in negotiations. You're just more quickly to accommodate anything. You often give in to make peace. Often you feel used or taken for granted. You complain about how much people take advantage of you, but then you don't do anything to change it. You often feel trapped. You just feel unable to improve the circumstances of your life. You take courses trying to figure out a way to improve your situation, but it never seems to improve. And that's because you don't deal with this. People pleasing thing. You sometimes feel more a slave with all kinds of masters than a free person. You feel that your life is not your own. You're more attuned to the needs of others than to your own needs. You want to know your own needs are. You can't be happy unless other people in your life are happy. You think you're in control of your life, but in one sense it looks others control you. Others decide your day and your life. You often do stuff you don't want to do or have a passion for. You do it because somebody else wants you to. While you appear to be very pleasing on the outside to those who are in authority, in your head you are lashing out against them. You're full of anger and resentment towards all these people using you. You lose yourself and others and sometimes don't know where you end and where they start.",

That's what happens in the gang fight. That's what happens in the gang world. That's what happens in the street level world. Is people obey the gang leader because they're afraid of not obeying the gang leader. it's obedience based on fear. It's love, what looks love based on fear. But do you realize that's not true love. what I say to clients all the time, the best way to motivate children in the long run is not fear. Because after a while, they'll rebel if you use fear. The best way in the long run is to just love them. And you go, that's no guarantee they're going to obey me away. But once they know they're fully loved and they live within that love, then they want to obey you. Not to earn, not to avoid getting punished, but to give back the overflow of the love that you've poured into them. love becomes the basis to produce love in somebody else that you give free will for. Fear does not produce genuine love in somebody else. And said, I'm going to create a world where love will be the most important thing. Now let me take that a little bit further. Do you realize that the greatest pleasure in life comes from a love connection. The problem with complex trauma is you didn't get that growing up. you've never experienced the highest pleasure that is humanly possible to enjoy. that's why drugs and alcohol become attractive because they give a pleasure that is close to that, but not quite as great as that. And you just keep going back to that because it makes you get all of the feelings that love was supposed to get and connection was supposed to get.",

But if somebody was to post something on Facebook about you would be in their face but if that person went home and overate and abused somebody else in their life you wouldn't even care. You just focus on certain things. And we all are in danger of ranking certain things as worse than others and treating people severely in the things we think are bad and ignoring a lot of other things. We need to have a consistency when we evaluate our relationships about the things that violate love. what is He saying. He is saying love has boundaries. Relationships to be healthy need boundaries. And some of the boundaries are about when somebody in the relationship steps outside of unhealthy and they begin to do things that are hurtful to the other person, to themselves, to the relationship. They lie, they cheat, they steal all of those different things. What is saying is love initially will fight to restore the relationship. It values the importance of and the relationship of good relationships. It values the importance of close, deeper intimacy with friendships. And it is willing to fight. But it does have a limit. It will set a boundary if the other person becomes abusive or isn't committed to grow and isn't committed to own their stuff and deal with their stuff and be willing to change from unhealthy to healthy, then I need to put greater and greater distance between myself and them. That is what is saying. And he is saying before you cut a person out of your life or before you put a severe boundary, make sure the person is not willing to change. Make sure you've done everything possible in a healthy way to help them see what they're doing and the damage that it's doing. he is giving us a guideline. Relationships are only healthy if both parties are committed to grow. If both parties are committed to own their stuff when they fail and to change.",

How do I know that they're refusing to change. And that's why you do this three-step process. It gives you the tools or the parameters to evaluate whether somebody has hardened their heart and committed to change. If you discover they haven't or they have hardened their heart and they're not willing to change, then you say, I can't be in a close relationship with you anymore because it's hurting me, it could drag me down, and it's going to hurt the children or whoever else, I need to set a boundary that puts greater distance between me and you to protect me, the children, and my own recovery. That's what it's about. And is saying that love of a person has a tough side. Tough side. loving somebody doesn't mean you never say no to them. Loving somebody doesn't mean you never make hard decisions that push them away from you. It might feel cruel. It might feel unloving to say, I can't be seeing you now. You're too toxic. That doesn't feel loving, but it actually is because it's forcing them to say, if you keep living the way you're living, here's one of the consequences. You can no longer have me in your life. And the benefits of that relationship. Hopefully that might make them do some thinking about their behavior that they never would have thought about if you just kept allowing them to use you and abuse you. love has a tough side. Now let me just fill in a few other things that is talking about. In this section of the book of Matthew, is talking about being a humble person. What is humility. And what is significant is what is saying here is humble people stand up for themselves. To be humble doesn't mean you're a doormat and let everybody use you and abuse you. He's saying, no, humility respects itself. It doesn't see itself as better than everybody.",

The next thing that is talking about in this is the willingness of love to pursue a person when they're straying, when they're moving and unhealthy. they will pursue them. They will try to work it out. They will try to confront the person and hopefully help them see what they're doing and the damage it's doing. They're doing it. They're doing it out of a love for the person and a desire to restore everything to healthy. It's not done out of a self-serving thing. It's done because it wants the best for the relationship and for the other person. I find it very instructive to see how did carry out these guidelines of the three-step process and how did carry it out. if you go back to the book of Judges in the Old Testament, one of the early books, what you find there is Israel started moving more and more into unhealthy behavior. They drifted away from. Every time they did, let them experience negative consequences, pain. That pain initially drove them back to and they were sorry and they realigned with , restored the relationship, but then they would start drifting again. After a while, they drifted and never came back and allowed them to go into worse and worse, negative consequences and it became a very painful existence for them. What I want you to understand is that took place over hundreds and hundreds of years. And as long as saw that they were facing things and kept coming back, He would restore them. He would restore them. He didn't implement the severe consequence of the evil that had done to them. He didn't restore them. He didn't do the consequence until the milder pain no longer brought them back to Him. But they just kept rebelling. Then He went to the more severe. the point is, we don't just say, I gave you three chances, you're gone. You might give them a chance and then they come back and then they fall away, but then they come back.",

I said, they have an insatiable appetite for attention, praise and admiration. They always are looking for a pat on the back for validation. Now I'm not saying you should never give people a pat on the back, because we should. That's part of being healthy. You validate people on their lives. That's part of what they're doing. A narcissist just wants it constantly. They're always looking for it. And then in their own mind, they think everybody's jealous of them. They think everybody wishes they could be them. And that, again, is in their own deluded fantasies. A key thing to understand about narcissists is they're all about image. they don't feel good enough inside, but they'll never admit that. they base all of their value on their image. their focus is looking good. they do that through a couple things. They associate with a high status person. if you're a very good looking woman and you've been with a narcissist, at some point you've wondered, I think I'm just a trophy on his arm. That he wants me on his arm, because I make him look good. He doesn't really care about me. He just cares that I make him look better than if he didn't have me. that's what narcissists do. And then if it's not a woman, then they want to say, I know the president of this, and I know the president of that. And they drop names. And they try to hang out and go for coffee with very influential people, because it makes them look good. And then they try to control how you think about them.",

And they're jealous if you talk to anybody else, if you go to an activity somewhere. Without them, jealousy kicks in and they get really cruel when jealousy kicks in and their control issues go up a notch. Extreme sensitivity and a tendency to be easily hurt, to feel rejected over the slightest little things. if you're with a healthy person, it takes a lot to really make them feel hurt. By something that you might do. A narcissist, they feel hurt when you've hardly done anything. Because they pick up hurt easily because of all of their shame issues. But then as soon as they feel hurt, guess whose fault it is. It's not their issues, it's yours, and they think you're just selfish. And then they need a mirror. They need that constant reflection.

Dear friends, we are already 's children, but he has not shown us yet what we will be when appears. But we do know this, that we will be for we will see him as he really is. what is saying is, you are a work in progress. You are not yet the finished product. But he loves you much that he is committed to one day finish what he started in you and when he finishes what he started, you are going to be beautiful just. There is not even going to be one flaw in you anymore. That's how committed he is. That's how deep his love goes. That's how long his love lasts. That's how deep his commitment towards you goes.

It was in response to the religious leaders at that time who basically said, we give our attention to the good living people, the wealthy people, the people with status, the addicts, the prostitutes, we ignore them, they're scum.

You only get what looks love if you earn it. Then if you earn love and they do something for you, what looks love, it's not really love. Now, basically, you're obligated to them. You're in their debt. You now owe them. They have something over you. love is actually sets up relationships where now you have to pay back. You keep score. You owe. They owe. It's always keeping calculations in your mind of who owes who. Another misconception about love for many people is that love is sex. And if you love somebody, then sex is how you show that to them. And that is very, very common. Another one is love equals pity. they can think of as a child, they didn't experience love. But if they saw a dog or a cat who was in pain, they would immediately feel pity for that empathy. And that felt love. And now when they feel empathy and pity for somebody who's hurting, they feel in love with that person.",

    "text": "And then a sad one is for many people coming up with complex trauma, they begin to equate love with pain. That if you love somebody, then you got to hurt them somehow. You got to restrict their fun. You got to punish them. That's how you show love to a person. And love and pain get very much confused. Now, there's another piece to this that I need to speak to. And that is people who grow up in complex trauma who've never experienced love. And they're not going to be able to experience unconditional love. What happens is they almost become waterproof to genuine love. if somebody was to try to heap unconditional love on them today, it'd be water off a duck's back. They wouldn't be able to receive it. Something in them would say, what's your agenda. This, now you're pitying me. Now I owe you. You're just doing this to be kind. You don't really mean it. And it would just, they wouldn't be able to receive it. They wouldn't be able to absorb it. It takes a lot of time. And I think that's a good thing. It takes time to relearn love and to be able to accept love. And you can only do it with safe people. But this, again, to me, is trust is a key building block of life. Unconditional love is a key building block of life and intimate relationships. Complex trauma destroys both, but important to gradually relearn them. The next one is those coming, and a complex trauma don't know what healthy loyalty is. let me start with this. Children are naturally loyal. When they love and respect somebody, they are loyal. You don't have to tell them to be loyal. They just are naturally loyal. But what happens in a home where parents are behaving in ways that don't engender respect, don't engender love, they're not safe people, they're hurting the children, they're not meeting their needs. the child, naturally, a healthy child, their natural instinct is to put boundaries up, to stay away from these people. But the parents within this unhealthy home, they want loyalty from their children. But the children are naturally not going to be loyal to them because they are not safe. how do they engender loyalty in these children that are being hurt, that are not safe.",

And they are not safe. how do they engender loyalty in these children that are being hurt, that are being hurt, that are being hurt, that are being neglected. , they do a couple things. Number one, you create loyalty through fear. If you ever go against me, you're going to regret it. They demonize anybody that's a rat. And they have the harshest punishments for those who are rats, who talk. Then there's an indoctrination process. Blood is thicker than water. You're always there for your family. You don't have anybody else but your family. they're constantly conditioning them to loyalty, loyalty, loyalty to those that are harmful. And what is really being put into the child's mind is this, that now you're loyal to people who are hurtful, who don't live by love, people that aren't going to be held accountable for their bad decisions and their bad behavior. You have to protect them. You have to keep them from ever experiencing consequences. You have to just take the hurt and not require equal treatment. that is what is beginning to happen. let me just say this. True loyalty is first of all to truth and love, the things that create safety and health. my greatest commitment and loyalty is to loving and to truth. Those are the only things that make a healthy society, healthy relationships. True loyalty is not, to a person initially. It's only to people who live out truth and love. I can be loyal to those people because they're safe, they're healthy. But if that person is no longer following truth and love, then I shouldn't be loyal to them. Because to be loyal to them basically is saying, I am being loyal to hurting other people. I am being loyal to violating love, to protecting people from negative consequences that they can continue hurting other people. And that's only going to hurt society. false loyalty is to hurtful people who do more and more damage. But wow, that indoctrination process of false loyalty is deep that people are afraid to break it because of what might happen to them if they ever break the loyalty code. That's an incredible situation. Take a few moments to think about how and where you see one of these things out of your head.",

    "text": "It's important to understand upfront that anger is probably one of the most intense emotions and it creates this powerful pull to act in certain ways. What is important to understand, again, upfront is that anger was initially designed to pull us in a positive direction. And I'll explain that in a little bit. What happens in complex trauma is that gets messed up and now anger pulls us in a negative direction, in a hard direction. And that's what anger does. And that's what anger does. And that's what anger does. And that's what anger does. And that's what anger does. It's a harmful direction. And to stop that pull is hard because anger, part of what makes it intense is cortisol is released to help you fight. And now it's a turbocharged emotion that's got extra chemicals behind it. And to try to control that is even more difficult. Some find that anger is a powerful pull. And I'll explain that in a little bit. Anger becomes their default setting. They become addicted to anger. They need to have anger, feel anger every day to feel normal, to feel alive, to feel energy. And that's a dangerous place for them. they don't need something to trigger them to become angry. They can get themselves angry every morning. They purposely try to get themselves angry because that gives them the energy to get going in the day.

It becomes their excuse to go get drunk or high. it's a huge relapse issue for those struggling with addiction. I think it's important to understand that anger has, there's two types. I call it the lava in the volcano and the eruption of the volcano. most people with complex trauma have this simmering lava that has been there for a long time. And for as long as they can remember, it just bubbles below the surface, often subconsciously. Once in a while, something triggers it and there's an eruption of anger. what is important to understand is when a lot of people think of anger, they go, I'm not an angry person. And what they're really saying to me is I don't have the eruption. in their mind, anger is only an eruption, an explosion. And what they're really saying to me is I don't have the eruption. in their mind, anger is only an eruption, an explosion. What I want them to see is, but you've got the lava. And that lava can be turned inward. That lava can just simmer away and become passive aggressive and how it affects stuff. And it doesn't look you're angry, but you've got a ton of anger down there. That is what becomes important for many people in complex trauma to understand is that anger isn't just explosions. Anger has other forms. Anger has other forms. And lava is important to understand. let's ask, where does this lava come from. let's go back to anger was designed as a good emotion. It was designed to kick in whenever something violated love. if somebody lied to you, if somebody stole from you, if somebody cheated on you, if somebody disrespected you, you should get angry because they're hurting you. And if they continue doing that, it's going to continue to hurt you, but it's going to hurt the relationship. And anger kicks in to say, hey, that's a violation of love. That's going to do short term and long term damage. And anger motivates you to try to push the relationship back to healthy. what happens when a relationship, when something violates love, is it steps outside of that boundary of healthy. And anger is saying, no, we got to get back to healthy.",

We got to respect each other. anger provides the motivation and the energy to try to get something back to a healthy state. And the brain releases cortisol to help do that. Secondly, if a person is in danger and they don't have the tools to resolve it, then anger, the cortisol gives them extra energy to fight or flight, to get out of danger. anger has two very, very good purposes in protecting a child and keeping stuff loving. But what happens in complex trauma. There's all kinds of things that violate love. There's disrespect all the time. Needs aren't being met. People are hurting each other. People are lying to each other. It's just constant violation of love. The child is getting angry. And they should be. That's good anger. But how do the parents respond to that anger. They punish it. They say they shouldn't have that. And now what happens to this anger is instead of it resolving a situation or leading to a situation being resolved, more pain is added on top of it. anger doesn't resolve situations. In their mind, anger leads to more pain. Now you're going to get punished. Now you're going to get judged. Now you're going to get shamed. Anger is bad. Let's repress anger. they push it down. Now what is important to understand is that anger might not be being expressed. They might not even be aware of how much is being pushed down. But it begins to show itself. as soon as children find something weaker, they start to show it. And when they're weaker, often they need to vent the anger. they become a bully. They get engaged in vandalism. They're unkind to animals. All kinds of different things where the anger is trying to come out. all of this anger pushed down creates lava. But it creates this thinking that anger is bad. Anger, if expressed, only leads to more pain. Somebody always will get hurt when there's anger. it soon becomes nothing about love. It all becomes about this is a terrible thing that leads to more pain and hurt.",

They start to use anger in unhealthy ways that give them instant gratification. they find out, wow, when I get angry, I intimidate people and then I can manipulate them. I can control them. They get afraid of me and they do what I want. anger is a great tool in my manipulation toolbox. Also, when I'm angry, I don't feel other emotions. I don't feel pain. I don't feel hurt. if I stay angry, that's the only emotion I feel because it's intense that I don't feel all the other emotions. I kind of that. Then what happens with people is as soon as I feel embarrassment, let's switch it to anger quickly. anger becomes a secondary emotion. as soon as I feel anxiety, embarrassment, shame, fear, let's turn it to anger. And they can do that within a nanosecond. they don't even know anymore what the real emotion is. All they know is I'm feeling anger. Another tool that many children used anger for was to create boundaries. they tried to say no to people. People didn't respect their boundary. And they had only two options left. They could isolate from people and create a boundary geographically. Or they could blow up. And use anger to do that. Or they could use anger to drive people away. The problem with that is when they blow up and drive people away, usually they feel guilty afterwards. And then they let everybody back in. Until they feel overwhelmed again and then they drive them away. anger became part of setting boundaries. Then another thing is they're getting hurt all the time. What they found is when they use their anger in sneaky ways, they can hurt others. anger is a great tool to hurt people. anger now is not about protecting love. Anger is now a tool to hurt people.

They want love, they love men, but they hate men. And that, they have to get sorted out. And then there's this fear as they become parents themselves that they're going to repeat their parents' parenting style. And often they do without knowing it or even though they don't want to. Because it was what their role model was. That's what their toolkit is. That's what all their subconscious brain programs are set to how to respond to various situations. You go back to how mom and dad responded. The next thing that's just common that comes out of mommy and daddy issues is codependency. the child basically is in a relationship with mom and dad where they're being wounded, their needs aren't being met. All of those things are happening. Mom and dad aren't owning it. Mom and dad aren't changing. the child feels, I have to change. I have to earn love. I have to make mom and dad happy if they're going to meet my needs. I have to become very aware of their emotions, their mood. And I have to respond to them. that if they're in a negative mood, I've got to fix them that they will take care of me. they become, I need to please in order to get love. I have to earn love.

They're pushing their own needs down, thinking their own needs are bad and putting everybody's needs ahead of their own.

Codependency is they're willing to accept the odd breadcrumb of love because that's the best they've been able to get growing up. And it felt good to get that little breadcrumb.

It's got a profound effect on how you deal with them. And it's a few other things. Most people with mommy-daddy issues have difficulty trusting others, especially in intimate relationships. And often they distrust the other person's intentions. Then they often have control issues that they need to have control in relationships. And then usually they have conflict with authority or authority issues because all of mom and dad were their two main authorities, and they were deeply hurt by them, and they don't trust them. Then they tend to over-explain themselves. This is to me an interesting characteristic. they never, as a child, because mom and dad were absent or neglectful, they never felt seen or heard that anybody got them. And now they feel this need to over-explain. You need to get me. if you're going to get me, I need to over-explain everything that you get me.

They learned early on that mom and dad wouldn't be there for them. they just said, I don't need anybody then. I'm going to be totally self-sufficient, independent. And they carry that as a badge of honor. And then they subconsciously push people away because that might make me where I need somebody. And I can't do that because I'm proud of the fact that I don't need anybody. Many people who've had absent parents end up engaging in very risky behaviors or outright rebellious behaviors. There's just a deep anger that they may not even be aware of that is driving them. And that starts to come out in their teen years in engaging in risky behaviors and rebellion. Then some, when they get into adult life and into intimate relationships, really struggle with commitment. They hated that their parents weren't committed to them, but they fear becoming committed to somebody else. And they really struggle. And some avoid commitment or some become super clingy.",

All of those things can change, but some have to go for a period of time with a very severe boundary that I can't have my parents in my life. And that is a painful reality for some. Now, let me end by just saying something to parents. To me, as I look at all the parents that I have dealt with over the years is we all fail as parents. Now, some of us, we had great intentions as parents, but we just were following bad advice. We were taught badly. We were taught badly about what a good parent was. Others, we had to be away from our children because we only could find one job and it was, we had to be away on the road. And it wasn't, we wanted to neglect or abandon our children. We just didn't have any options. We had to pay the bills. Then others, we were going through some difficult stuff at that time. We had a very sick child or we had somebody who died or we had a loss of a business. And we weren't trying to neglect our kids. It's just that life was overwhelming that we just didn't have the time or energy to give the kids what they needed. And others will say, what. I know I failed as a parent. It just tears me apart with guilt. I don't know what to do with it. Or others go, I was a great parent. And they're in total denial about how they hurt their children. They don't want to go there. They refuse to go there. And then others go, I was a great parent. And they're in total denial about how they hurt their children. They don't want to go there. They refuse to go there. And then others, we're a pretty good parent. there's all kinds of options about the type of parenting that we end up in and the reasons we end up there and then how we view it now. But what I want us to see is that we all can still grow as a parent. I find it interesting that children, even in their 40s, 50s, 60s, still typically want a relationship with their parents.",

The other shoe is about to drop. Dad has been nice now for a few days, but now dad's about to get angry again. It's all about to go downhill. And that sets up a system in the brain that as soon as things start going smoothly, the other shoe is about to drop. the next one for people is if I succeed at something, when my life has been chaotic, when my life has been struggling and failing and not doing , if I start succeeding, that puts me in a place where it's all brand new.

You're just acting here. This isn't the real you. And everybody's going to see how terrible I am. to succeed is to put myself more visible and is to put myself in change and in the unknown, all of the things that I'm afraid of. The next one is that if I'm successful, then people will notice me, but then they might start expecting more of me. I won't be able to remain invisible. I won't be able to remain invisible. I won't be able to remain invisible. I won't be able to remain somewhat irresponsible. I won't be able to just do my little bits of taking care of me.

I will get dad angry. I will make things worse. I'll make that shoe drop.

    "text": "a lot of people when they're lonely and they think I just need a relationship part of what they're thinking is I need somebody else to fix me and what I want you to see again is much of what happened in childhood parents should have met your needs but they didn't the way that they should have and usually because they didn't know any better but now you have to parent yourself you have to learn to meet those needs because that was the goal of parenting was to meet those needs until you learned how to meet them yourself and for you to now expect somebody else to be a parent and meet all your needs is for you to stay in a very childlike immature state and that's only going to cause relationships to fail another thing that can lie that can happen for some people is getting married will secure the relationship they start dating and or living together and all of a sudden there's stuff that's going on that is creating some insecurities the relationship in trouble are we going to make it we're starting to have more and more problems and more issues and the solution is we just need to get married that will make sure the relationship gets stable again is secure that we're going to stick together and it's kind of fantasy thinking magic thinking but it goes deeper than that what it's really thinking is that the ritual of the marriage ceremony is going to create stability and security it's putting my sense of security in a ritual but the reality is rituals can be empty rituals don't provide security that's a false sense of security comes when both people are committed to working through issues together in healthy ways are committed to keep growing in their own life committed to growing in love in the relationship and all that means and meeting of needs then you have security but what is easy for people coming out of complex trauma is they didn't have security there was chaos in the home parents weren't there for them they didn't have a connection and that's where security is supposed to come from is healthy connection mainly it's also supposed to come from parents providing a safe environment but it's mainly coming from connection but when you don't have connection what children often do is to think the path to security is to have the external environment that looks stable let's have the good job the nice house the money in the bank let's get married that provides security but it's got it backwards security comes from true connection from both wanting to get healthy a third one is also kind of magical thinking and it's if it's true love it will just work and we get this in movies and songs all the time I met you I fell in love with you we both feel strongly towards each other have such 100 positive feelings for each other think only 100 positively about each other we seem to get along together we've never had a conflict it's just gonna work and that is limbic brain that's oxytocin and the effect of oxytocin creating these intense positive feelings but that's very child looking at the future based on how what they're feeling now they're not looking realistically at here's what makes for a healthy life here's what makes for a healthy relationship here's what life is really all about and what true happiness the recipe for true happiness and success are they just go I feel good this I just need to keep reproducing whatever's making this feeling it'll be great forever and again a relationship isn't guaranteed to work because you both have a good feeling a relationship only works if both people are committed to get healthy committed to work through stuff in healthy ways are committed to meeting 12 needs love and what that means in very practical terms is a relationship only works if both people are able to have secure attachment if they're both still an insecure attachment they're going to have trouble relationships only going to work if both are able to be authentic if they're wearing masks or fawning it's not going to work it's only going to work if they're able to be vulnerable and to open up and to allow deeper and deeper intimacy if they treat each other with respect as equals that your needs matter just as much as mine if they're able to be present and emotionally available to the other person if they're able to trust if they're able to communicate if they were set healthy boundaries those are the ingredients of a healthy marriage it doesn't matter the feelings they come and go you have to have those motivation stones and if they're not there you can have all the fantasy thinking you want and all the magical thinking you want but it won't create a healthy relationship there's a fourth lie that comes out of parts of our culture and that is I'm in love with you I will never have feelings with for anybody else and I think anybody who's lived very long at all knows that's a lie yes I have strong feelings for you now and in this moment I don't have feelings for anybody else but over time those feelings will dim a little bit I will probably feel some attraction to others that's just being human that doesn't mean I'm failing that doesn't mean I love you that just means I'm a human let me just expand on that a little bit what happens in complex trauma is it sets you up to think that these intense feelings coming out of oxytocin coming from this attraction that I'm feeling that they're going to last forever the reality is if people that people from complex trauma haven't learned how to connect in healthy ways and their only feeling of connection is intense feelings but if you haven't learned to connect in healthy ways you're going to get into a relationship with intense feelings but not have true connection and what's going to happen without true connection and those feelings are going to quickly disappear and then what's going to happen is the next person you see that creates intense feelings you're going to feel connection to them and all of a sudden part of you wants to move on and it's the issue isn't the intense feeling the issue is there true connection because if there's not then you're going to find yourself attracted to others more than that lack of connection leads to discontent the relationship becomes boring the relationship becomes frustrating and not being able to connect creates a real vulnerability to be attracted to others but there's more than that every relationship has its ups and downs you can have true connection but it's not always going to have intense emotions true connection doesn't need intense emotions but yet you're going to meet people and feel an attraction too that's normal that doesn't mean there's something wrong in the relationship that just means you're human but you need to know how to handle those feelings of being attracted to others that you don't feed them because if you start feeding them then that can pull you away from the true connection to back to this connection to back to this very oxytocin intense feeling, which could be very unhealthy.",

I need to manage that. I'm not going to feed it. And usually those feelings will pass if you don't feed it within a couple weeks. But not feeding it requires really good boundaries, internal and external. I'm not going to let myself think about it. I'm not going to text. I'm not going to call. I'm not going to go and try and be in the same room where they're going to be at and interact with them. You have to have good boundaries. And let me just add this. If you're in a relationship and there's true connection, but now you're feeling a connection or you're feeling an attraction, to somebody else and it's not going away and part of you is starting to want to feed it, please talk to somebody. Because if you've got a really good connection and a healthy relationship, it's not worth it to lose that for this very intense limbic brain experience. Another subtle one that's part of our culture is if the package is beautifully wrapped, its contents must be fabulous. We have much focus on our culture, on the package, how beautiful the package is. We sexualize women's bodies all the time. The focus is that body and how pretty it is. And many people when they date, that's their main criteria is this has to be a drop dead gorgeous person. And if this person is gorgeous that they make you just fall over the moon and love, then do you need- must be going to work. It must be the person. I want to acknowledge that, we want to be in a relationship with somebody that we find attractive. But please think about it a bit deeper. The external packaging doesn't tell you about what's on the inside. And it's the inside that's the real person. you can have the most drop-dead gorgeous person and get married to them and find out that the inside is quite ugly. Pretty soon you're going to lose interest in the external.",

Because it sets off brain chemicals, oxytocin, dopamine, that give very nice feelings that cause me to start to want something, to be attracted to something, to feel in love with something.

Underlying deep maladaptive issues, I'm going to have years of pain. But if I end it now, it's going to hurt. I'm going to grieve, but it's going to spare me years of pain. The next one is a romantic relationship is the automatic ticket to self-esteem. , many people with shame walk around, they don't themselves. They feel others don't them. their self-esteem is very low. They don't feel good enough. They don't feel lovable, valuable. And what they begin to think is if somebody else me, then I'm just going to myself. It's going to fix my shame issues. But that's codependency. It's depending on others to give me positive validation to feel better about myself. But that doesn't heal shame. It just temporarily makes me feel better. Shame heals when I choose to give myself positive validation and accept who I am and not be dependent on others giving me positive validation as the only way to feel better about myself. know this, if you don't accept yourself, truly love yourself, when others give it to you, it will feel good for a bit.

Line number seven, a romantic relationship magically changes people for the better. Again, I think this comes out of a fantasy that's based a little bit on what feels truth. let's say you see somebody that's in addiction or is very angry. You're going to tell them, I'm going to tell you something that's going to make you angry instead of sad. Now what I'm telling you is, if that not someone, a person, is more , more most effective, it's going to come out of your condemnation.

The last thing I want to say is where you're going to put money from here and that is money. their addiction. It sounds good, but the truth is if they were controlling before the relationship, there's other issues besides just lack of love that cause them to be controlling. And if they're not willing to look at those other issues, their shame issues, you can love them all you want, they're still going to be controlling. They have to be willing to do work on themselves. They have very painful core issues before they're going to change. Yes, they need a safe environment to do that where there is love, but just having a loving environment isn't going to magically fix them. the point again is this, we can't change anybody. We can provide love and safety, but unless they're willing to change, it's not going to happen.",

And I think that's a very important part of the relationship. All you need is love. That's going to fix everything. And it doesn't look realistically at what brings about true change. Next is that a romantic relationship will magically cure one's sexual struggles. I hear this often, people that struggle with sex addiction, porn addiction, just this insatiable longing for sex, sex, sex. They go, I just need to get out of here. I just need to get out of here. I just need to get out of here. I just need to get in a relationship. And if I get sex in a healthy relationship, that'll fix all of my sexual problems. Now there's again, a partial that if you're in a relationship, yes, it is a sexual outlet that can be very meaningful. And for a person that just has a good sex drive and able to have true connection and they don't use sex in unhealthy ways, then a relationship can really help with kind of that sexual connection. And I think that's a great way to get out of that sexual frustration. But if a person has a sex addiction, porn addiction, there's other issues that are driving the car. There's lack of connection issues often behind it that drove them to want to connect with magazines and pictures and one night stands to avoid true healthy connection. They don't know how to have that. what happens is if they get into a relationship, it might help them with their sex addiction stuff for a while. But if they don't deal with those underlying issues, it's only a matter of time before they're going to be back at them. please be aware that a relationship isn't a magic fix to sexual problems.

Truly healthy sexual relationship is that you connect also emotionally and you love each other every day not just when you want sex. You're present to the other person emotionally available. meaningful sex is not just great sex in the act of sex. It's all of life and true connection. sex, please understand, is not the glue that holds a relationship together. And sadly many people coming out of complex trauma who don't know how to connect, who don't know how to have that glue of communication and trust and true connection and presence to each other, they just think, we've got a problem, let's have sex, that makes us feel close again. And they put all the work and the effort and the effort and weight on sex to be the glue that holds them together. But it doesn't. It's other issues.

    "text": "Then after they've been in this for long, they just go, this is normal. They don't even see it as crappy or terrible anymore. It's just, that's -. It's not the greatest, but it's normal. The negative parts of it because it's normal. And then when things improve just a tiny little bit, oh, this is really good. their way of evaluating shifts to a different standard. Another thing that can happen is because a child needs a hero, let's say both mom and dad are neglecting them, hurting them, abusing them. But dad plays with the child once in a while. Dad's a little bit more fun. Dad gives them gifts. all of a sudden what they do is they put dad on a pedestal and they make mom the bad guy. And they turn all their hatred towards mom. And they just find fault with mom and everything and just see dad as perfect. that can happen. that drive to connect is huge. But then it's understanding brain chemicals. whenever we experience love or what, it feels love. if you think of your love languages, when people say nice things to you, people give you gifts, people make sacrifices for you, people spend time with you, people give you physical affection and hugs, all of that feels love. It releases chemicals in the brain. It releases dopamine. That's pleasure. It releases serotonin. It releases oxytocin. That feels love. And there's vasopressin, which builds towards long committed relationships. all of those good chemicals flood your brain and it feels wonderful. But there's another purpose that I want you to understand with dopamine. when a need seems to be met, you feel pleasure, the brain goes, oh, that must have just met a need. That's why you feel good. you were very sad and you ate food and that made you feel better. it releases dopamine. And dopamine, not just to give you pleasure, but to burn in a memory that the next time you feel sad, you need to eat food because that meets your need. That will make you feel better. And what is happening is a child who gets what is not genuine love, they get gifts once in a while to buy them off. They get a bit of fun once in a while that feels good.",

    "text": "They get the odd, I love you once in a while. It's totally hypocritical. The actions don't match the words, but it feels good. The child has a release of chemicals and they go, this is love. I feel loved. And then it burns into the memory that these people are the ones who love me. These people are the ones I need to go to every time I'm feeling a need. There's another part to this, and that is these chemicals, are also released at another time. Apart from love, if you are going through fear, deprivation, you're going through neglect and abuse. you're in a very negative place. There's no positive chemicals in your brain. There's fear, there's anger, there's cortisol, there's this emptiness inside you, this blackness inside you. And all of a sudden, the trauma stops, the fear stops, the danger stops. All of a sudden, somebody stops withholding love from you. Somebody does one little thing for you. It releases those chemicals. It's the stopping of the bad that releases the chemicals. It's one thing that appears to be almost a little kindness that releases the chemicals. what I want you to understand is that trauma, if that's your normal, as soon as the trauma stops, it releases chemicals and you feel, whoever made this stop loves me. Whoever made this stop is the person I want to connect with. And that is another big part of this trauma bonding. Then there's a third piece, and that's the cycle of abuse. the cycle of abuse is the relationship begins with this love bombing honeymoon, where the person uses your five love languages. And then they're , I'm going to go to bed. I'm going to go to bed. I'm going to go to bed. And they just keep you with gifts. They say nice things. They do things for you. They spend lots of time with you. And you just feel love, love, love. But then it moves beyond that stage, and it goes to a tension stage. They start to devalue you. They put you down. There's discontent happening. Tension is starting to build. And then it comes to this explosion stage where there's abuse. that initial first step is to start to build. And then you start to build. And then you start to build. And then you start to build.",

Everybody's nice and good again. But then you go to that building tension, devaluing, discontent, and then another explosion. that's what begins to happen. what I want you to understand is in that very first time through the cycle, when that person has loved, bombing you, looking they're meeting your 12 needs, you're being flooded with the chemicals in your brain that feel good. You feel much you're being loved. You got dopamine locking in that this is the person who loves you, that meeting your needs. You are feeling this strong emotional bond building with this person who's love bombing you because of this stage. Then when you get to the things starting to go bad, and there's a lot of fear starting to happen, there's deprivation, devaluation, then there's the acute explosion, you go back to the honeymoon station and you get all the chemicals again. You go, oh, see, this is a wonderful person. They're just having a bad day. But then the cycle starts going around and around. And what begins to happen with that is it gets more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more. And then you get to the point where you're feeling more of the negative, less and less of the honeymoon. But that when you're in this very negative place where the tension's building and your needs are deprived and there's no good chemicals coming and you got fear building, the good stuff's going to come soon. Just hang in there. And when the good stuff comes, such a relief. Or when the anger stops, when the abuse stops, all the chemicals flood in. When the trauma stops, all the chemicals, flood in. And you go, this person's the wonderful person. And you can see that the more this cycle continues, the stronger the bond, chemical bond that's happening in the brain that is being built.",

    "text": "back again to this tension stage, the person begins to know that after the tension stage comes the reward, where the pain, stops and the love bombing starts. they can tolerate the tension stage now. They might actually try to make the bad stuff happen just to get on with the good stuff. they've now got a reward system built into the cycle. And the person that gives the reward is the person that's abusing them. But they look forward to the reward. That makes them feel very connected. And they're very much connected to this person. It's interesting to me to see the similarities here between Stockholm Syndrome. Stockholm Syndrome came because of bank robbery and people that were taken captive as part of the bank robbery. And what they found is after these captives after a while began to feel, identify with their captors. They began to feel affection for them, loyal to them. And they go, what. What just happened here. These people are holding them, kidnapping them, holding them hostage. And now they them. Now they have affection for them. What happened there. And what psychologists believe is that when they were first captured, they were made to feel that they could lose their life. their fear went to the max. They were in a super traumatized place. Then when the captors decide not to kill them, they just feel this huge relief, which floods them with all the chemicals. They even feel now gratitude to their captors for letting them stay alive. And all of those chemicals going on in their brain now cause them to feel affection to listen to their captors to identify with their captors. And trauma bonding happens within this Stockholm syndrome. It's very -. syndrome. It's part of it. But what I want you to see is it goes beyond that. Now there's a fourth element to trauma bonding, and that's that intermittent. you go through the cycle, the good time's coming, you're just not sure when. you don't know when the reward's going to come, but it's sporadic, you can't predict it. And you don't know when they're going to switch from Jekyll to Hyde, that's unpredictable as , but it's going to happen. And what we know from addiction is that one of the hardest types of addictions to deal with is where the reward is intermittent.",

If I'm in pain, the child is thinking. Only mom and dad can fix my pain. They need to validate that they hurt me and apologize. They need to validate that my pain is real. Then I can resolve the pain. Then I can move on the pain. That's the way it should be. But what is happening because of that is you begin to believe when you're in an abusive relationship that the only way I can move on from my pain and the wounds is they have to validate that they hurt me. They have to validate that. That. My pain is real. In other words, I am dependent on the healing journey. They are necessary. They have a role, a necessary role in my healing journey that they have to validate my pain. They have to validate that they did something wrong. Otherwise, I can't move on. What they don't see is that you could fix the pain by leaving the relationship, by validating the pain yourself, by having other healthy people validate your pain. Then you can move on. Then you could heal. Then you could really do. But what the indoctrination has done is brought you to a place where you begin to believe, I need them to validate it. That's the only way I can heal and move on. do you see that these characteristics here and beliefs are all codependent characteristics. what is happening is that you are believing that you must become codependent in order to have a relationship. You have to put your needs aside. You have to conform. You have to make their needs all important. You have to be more attuned to them than you are to yourself. You have to be the one that makes all the sacrifices and does all the changing. trauma bonding is part of codependency. That's what I want you to see. There's a final aspect to this trauma bonding. You think of the child with trauma bonding in complex trauma. It creates an unhealthy default setting. An unhealthy. Normal. number one, they have an unhealthy but normal relationship template, which is they're superior. I'm inferior. My needs don't matter. Their needs matter.",

Secondly, if you leave, fantastic. But be aware that your feelings may not just disappear. You may still miss them. You may still feel feelings of love towards them at times. You are going to have desires to go back to them. Be aware of that. When those feelings hit, don't feed them. Don't give in to them. It doesn't mean you're failing to have those feelings. It just means your brain is doing what your brain does. It's looking. Because of all that dopamine, what's the solution to the emotions I'm feeling now. And it's saying, oh, I need to go back to this person. the feelings in your limbic brain are going to take a long time to gradually get less and less and disappear. you've got to kind of sit through letting those feelings come, acknowledging them, but not giving into them. Now, what happens to some people is they're in a relationship. They know in their head, this relationship is all bad now. It's hurting me. I need to leave. They want to leave, but their feelings just keep them in the relationship. I can't leave. Maybe if I just talk to them, it'll get better. And they just are powerless to actually break through. And that's where you're going to need some help. And we're going to come back to that. Also understand that this addiction element, that you formed an addiction in your brain, is going to bring pain to this person that when you're going through any negative emotions, fear, loneliness, sadness, pain of any kind, your brain's going to immediately go, the solution is to go back to this person.

They exist but they're not truly alive. They survive but they don't thrive. And what are the components of this existing survival mode. , there's ongoing danger.

And that belief is a negative belief that something's wrong with me. I'm not good enough. I don't feel lovable. I don't feel that I have any value just for being me. I feel inferior, less than is my normal default setting. And we developed what that meant, where it came from, and that for basically every person from complex trauma, they end up with shame. Because once they are neglected or abused or abandoned or their needs aren't consistently met, they conclude it's their fault. I must not be good enough. That's why I'm being neglected and abused. There must be something wrong with me. That's why I'm being neglected and abused. they develop this developing self-concept that is all negative. What I want to do tonight is go into the next part of where does the brain then go once it's reached this conclusion that I'm not good enough.

This happens in the mind of a small child at a subconscious level. the first thing that you have to understand is the conclusion that comes is not just that I'm not good enough, but there's a second conclusion, which is if the two people that brought me into the world have concluded that I'm not good enough, therefore I can be neglected or abandoned or abused. That means that anybody that gets to know me is going to abandon me or abuse me or neglect me. I can't have that happen. And with shame develops a fear of abandonment. And fear becomes the main emotion that trumps everything else. But at a subconscious level, and it's I can't stand the pain of being abandoned, but I'm afraid of being abandoned. I'm afraid if people get to know me, they'll abandon me again. And that scares me to death. what am I going to do to never be abandoned. that's where the brain starts to go. the first conclusion is I must hide who I am.

What happens from that as they grow up is they still long to connect but now they're afraid to connect. they long for that connection but they're afraid if they do connect somebody will find them out. they have conflicting desires in themselves. A longing for connection and a fear of connection at the same time. And they live by this rule. Never be authentic. Always be phony. Always be phony. Because if you're authentic nobody will want to connect with you. Your only chance of connection is if you're phony. But you go that's not going to be real connection. here's what the brain does. It says I wonder if there's a way to have fake connection. I wonder if it's possible to have the feelings of connection without actually connecting with somebody. I wonder if it's possible to have the feelings of connection without really connecting. I wonder if it's possible to have the feelings of connection without relationships. And that's where the brain goes. And guess what. Our culture today offers you a smorgasbord of possibilities of fake connection. What is bar room intimacy. Everybody hugs each other and laughs and smacks each other on the back. And say you're great. I just love you. And how deep did the conversation go. Less than one millimeter deep. Less than one millimeter deep. Less than one millimeter deep. It was superficial. There was no true intimacy. But there were the feelings of intimacy. And that's what fake connection is. on the surface to the limbic brain it seems to be satisfying. But it doesn't really satisfy at a deep level. It leaves you thirsty. Do what the fastest growing addiction in the world is now. Internet. Porn. Why. Fake connection.",

I want the feelings of connection without the mess of a relationship. What do many people get through sports. It's the only time where men hug each other and smack each other on the butt. And do all of that. What is going on. We're bros. We're on the same team. I love you buddy. You really. Because you have that warrior spirit. We're on the same team fighting a battle. And we feel close. But it's fake closeness. It's not real intimate connection. we have all kinds of things. How about social media today. Do you realize that most of our kids will text hundreds and hundreds of times. And they'll be , I'm going to text you. I'm going to text you. I'm going to text you. I'm going to text you. And they will text hundreds and hundreds of times a day or message their friends. And they'll say we are connected to each other. But it is superficial. They haven't truly connected. Do there was a study done just a couple years ago about millennial children who have all the texting social media stuff. And what they're finding is that this generation that seems more connected than any other generation the loneliest generation to have yet existed because they don't have true connection. that is the reality of our culture. We have become a culture of fake connection. And that is a result of a shame base. Let's see if we can get the feelings of connection without true intimacy. Now I want to read you something that Dr. Rachel Worsman wrote, which I think is excellent, because it's going to bring the drug picture into this whole connection thing. she's written an article, you can read it, called How Loneliness Fuels Opioid Addiction. She was on TED Talks as about this. But here's what she says. The human brain uses naturally occurring opioids. opioids, we think of morphine, oxycontin, fentanyl, heroin, those are all your opioids. T3s have opioids. They're painkillers,. But what she says is this. The brain uses naturally occurring opioids to maintain a balance among important brain circuits that shape social thinking and behavior. opioids have a bigger purpose than then deadening pain.",

In other words, Mephibosheth, I'm giving you back what you once had. You never have to worry about being cared for again. You never have to worry about a meal again. I will meet your needs now. You are going to finally get taken care of the way you should have all along. Mephibosheth bowed respectfully and exclaimed, Who is your servant that you should show such kindness to a dead dog me.

It's important to understand that children are naturally trusting. They can't meet any of their own needs. And in order to survive, they have to fully trust somebody else that they're going to meet their needs. And children are very forgiving. If somebody lets them down, that they'll trust again. think of a child who's on the roof and is told to jump and they jump in the parent doesn't catch them. But then the next time. They're on the roof. The parent says, I'll catch you this time. And the child just trusts again. They give the parent another chance. it takes an awful lot to kind of knock trust out of a child. They just keep trusting those in authority over and over again. But in complex trauma, what is happening is two things. Usually either those in authority consistently aren't trustworthy. Or they're inconsistent. some days they're trustworthy, some days they're not. That one really presents the biggest issue for kids. Because they keep hoping that next time the parents will be trustworthy. Because they have been trustworthy in the past. it takes even longer for them to give up on trust. But eventually they get to a point where they feel betrayed. And that's. To me, to have trust broken over and over again is betrayal. And that's why often we refer to complex trauma as betrayal trauma. And what happens at that moment is they go to kind of two different ways of dealing with that finally broken trust. Number one, I'll never trust again. Trust means you're going to get hurt. Trust means people are going to promise one and not deliver. You're going to get betrayed. The second option. That. Some go to is if I you, I'm going to trust you 100. And they just keep going to people that they , trust them 100. it's kind of all or nothing. But those that trust 100 all, all at once haven't checked the person out. Haven't seen if there's evidence that they're trustworthy. All they're going by is their limbic brain saying, I you. And they set themselves up to get hurt again and again. Now, I think it's really important.",

    "text": "They're trying to change to get people to now meet their needs, to stop hurting them, but nobody is. And the child didn't ask for it. They didn't do anything to deserve it, but they are being mistreated. They are a victim. They can't do anything about it. And what begins to happen is the child goes from being just a victim to now feeling a helpless victim. A hopeless victim. That they can't resolve the situation. And they easily can slide into a victim mentality. And what happens when they come into adult life is as soon as life gets difficult, they can be feeling confident, they can feel being hopeful, but as soon as they face a problem that they can't resolve away, they can go from feeling 100 empowered to feeling helpless. To feeling helpless and hopeless in a heartbeat. And they can go to feeling a helpless victim in a heartbeat. That happens subconsciously for people coming out of complex trauma that all of a sudden they develop this, oh, I can't do anything about it. It's useless. It's hopeless. And what then can begin to happen is they will go, let's say, in a crisis, to visit a counselor, or a coach, and they'll complain about their partner, they'll complain about their circumstances, but they won't do anything to change them. The counselor will give them lots of advice and tell them, you should probably do this, consider doing this, and they won't follow any of the advice. Why. Because they just are stuck in being a victim. That is such a dangerous place. People that come out of complex trauma, who slide into this victim mentality, usually don't grow too much in recovery. They grow to a certain point, but then they keep sliding into this victim mentality where they just are helpless, they don't feel they have any agency, they don't do anything to change their situations. There's another piece to this that I think is important. And that is, what happens when a child is in pain in a healthy home is parents come and validate their pain. And there's something in having your pain validated that is comforting, but empowers you to be able to change it. What happens in complex trauma is you're in pain, you're getting no validation for your pain. In fact, you're getting judged for your pain.",

    "text": "And the person gets drawn into chasing after feelings of connection without really checking out if the person is emotionally available. But there's something else that tends to happen. When you grow up with a template where the people in your life are emotionally unavailable, what can happen without realizing it is that gradually you become emotionally unavailable because you realize that you, by being emotionally available, you are getting hurt. what many people do and this is very subtle, often subconscious, is they are good at seeming they're emotionally available. They're good at caring for people. They're good at being giving, at being kind, at helping people. And it looks they're emotionally available. But that's their persona. Anybody that tries to get to know them beyond just that service that they do and caring for people, they'll bump into a wall. They'll find this person is not going to let me into their inner world. they act emotionally available but that is just a surface thing. And it becomes important for people coming out of complex trauma to begin to realize you can never have a healthy relationship unless I am emotionally available, unless I find people who are truly emotionally available. And that means I have to deal with my insecure attachment. I have to deal with my emotional attachment issues. I have to learn to attach in healthy ways to healthy people. And that is a huge challenge and we've done other videos on that. The next characteristic of people coming out of complex trauma is that they have a distorted view of love. Most people coming out of complex trauma do not understand unconditional love because they've never experienced it. for them, love must be earned. You only get what looks love if you earn it. Then, if you earn love and they do something for you, what looks love, it's not really love now. Basically, you're obligated to them. You're in their debt. You now owe them. They have something over you. love is actually sets up relationships where now you have to pay back. You keep score. You owe. They owe. It's always keeping calculations in your mind of who owes who. Another misconception about love for many people is that love is sex. if you love somebody, then sex is how you show that to them. And that is very, very common.",

    "text": "Another one is love equals pity. they can think of as a child, they didn't experience love, but if they saw a dog or a cat who was in pain, they would immediately feel pity for that, empathy. And that felt love. And now when they feel empathy and pity for somebody who's hurting, they feel in love with that person. And then a sad one is for many people coming up with complex trauma, they begin to equate love with pain. That if you love somebody, then you got to hurt them somehow. You got to restrict their fun. You got to punish them. That's how you show love to a person. And love and pain get very much confused. Now there's another piece to this that I need to speak to. And that is people who grew up in complex trauma who've never experienced unconditional love, what happens is they almost become waterproof to genuine love. if somebody was to try to heap unconditional love on them today, it'd be water off a duck's back. They wouldn't be able to receive it. Something in them would say, what's your agenda. This, now you're pitying me. Now I owe you. You're just doing this to be kind. You don't really mean it. And it would just, they wouldn't be able to receive it. They wouldn't be able to absorb it. It takes time to relearn love and to be able to accept love. And you can only do it with safe people. But this, again to me, is trust is a key building block of life. Unconditional love is a key building block of life in intimate relationships. Complex trauma destroys both. But important to gradually relearn them. The next one is those coming out of complex trauma don't know what healthy loyalty is. let me start with this. Children are naturally loyal. When they love and respect somebody, they are loyal. You don't have to tell them to be loyal. They just are naturally loyal. But what happens in a home where parents are behaving in ways that don't engender respect, don't engender love, they're not safe people, they're hurting the children, they're not meeting their needs. the child naturally, a healthy child, their natural instinct is to put boundaries up. To stay away from these people.",

But the children are naturally not going to be loyal to them because they are not safe. how do they engender loyalty in these children that are being hurt, that are being neglected. they do a couple things. Number one, you create loyalty through fear. If you ever go against me, you're going to regret it. They demonize anybody that's a rat. And they have the harshest punishments for those who are rats, who talk. Then there's an indoctrination process. Blood is thicker than water. You're always there for your family. You don't have anybody else but your family. they're constantly conditioning them to loyalty, loyalty, loyalty to those that are harmful. And what is really being put into the child's mind is this, that now you're loyal to people who are hurtful, who don't live by love, people that aren't going to be held accountable for their bad decisions and their bad behavior. You have to protect them. You have to keep them from ever experiencing consequences. You have to just take the hurt and not require equal treatment. that is what we're talking about. That is what is beginning to happen. let me just say this. True loyalty is first of all to truth and love. The things that create safety and health. my greatest commitment and loyalty is to loving and to truth. Those are the only things that make a healthy society, healthy relationships. True loyalty is not to a person initially. It's only to people who live out truth and love. I can be loyal to those people because they're safe, they're healthy. But if that person is no longer following truth and love, then I shouldn't be loyal to them. Because to be loyal to them basically is saying, I am being loyal to hurting other people. I am being loyal to violating love, to protecting people from negative consequences that they can continue hurting other people. And that's only going to hurt society. false loyalty is to hurtful people who do more and more damage. But wow, that indoctrination process of false loyalty is deep that people are afraid to break it. Because of what might happen to them if they ever break the loyalty code. The next one.",

Also, conform to what the other person wants and put all your needs and desires down. Repress them. you basically become a reflection of what the other person wants and needs. the only way you have any chance for peace and happiness is to become smaller, to put your needs aside, to become what the other person wants, and they get good at it.

I know what you feel, I also know what I feel. My thinking, my feeling, is just as important as your thinking and feeling. That is what makes healthy relationships.

It's not until adult life that you begin to experience the full ramifications of the damage of what took place in childhood.",

They're taking care of parts of themselves but not all of themselves. Secondly, I find that a lot of people they just know they're tired but they don't know why. they just know oh I need some self-care but they don't know what's caused them to become depleted. there's a lack of awareness about what depletes us. And what people then do is oh I'm tired. I just need to rest physically. And that might not be exactly what they need. They might need a self-care that goes beyond just physical rest. And I really want to dig into this because what I find is for a lot of people they see some of the current teaching that might kind of just be that more superficial you just need to go have a day at the spa and they just think that's going to fix all their problems. And they don't have a full enough understanding of what true self-care is. And they don't understand at a conscious level all the things that bring about us feeling depleted. I think for anybody in recovery they know that when they're depleted of energy it's a dangerous time for them. if they're depleted physically they're exhausted or they're depleted emotionally or they're depleted in their life. Or they're death by body badly or they take risks in life. They're compensating through detailed psychology around君 harder research on micro effects and their relattendance. They're really tugging on why didn't I get to the處 knew let me feel better. , the question is who will you decompress and what happens if you don't. For the most part they'll try to slow down their water temperature and won't take that Rejuvenator. They go into recovery after years of basically dissociating. they've suppressed all their emotions. They've lived robots. They just do what needs to be done. They don't feel much. They're not aware of what's going on inside of them. It's just all about productivity and doing stuff.",

What do they think of my hair. What do they think of my looks. What do they think of how I just performed. Takes a lot of energy. If you have a false guilt, that's always been your default setting, you need to feel guilty to feel normal, that takes a lot of energy. If you've always had an anger, and you need to feel angry to feel normal, that takes a lot of energy. If you've got anxiety or negative thoughts, negativity that we talk about, that takes a lot of energy. If that's your default setting and your brain just naturally keeps gravitating back to wanting to feel negative and anxious. Some are always living by shoulds, unrealistic expectations for themselves. I should be doing this, I should be doing that. That takes a lot of energy if that's your default setting. Perfectionism, controlling we've talked about. If you are a person that your default setting is stuffing emotions, that's the first thing you do when you feel an emotion is want to stuff it and be stoic. That takes a lot of energy. If you have a default setting that doesn't want to feel emotions, you just have distractions all the time, that takes a lot of energy. what I want you to see is when you look at the 60 characteristics of complex trauma that we talk about, a lot of those 60 characteristics can become a default setting for people from complex trauma and most of those characteristics, if you think about it, you realize, whoa, it takes a lot of energy to have that as my normal. it's important to begin to realize that people coming out of complex trauma, they have come to a place as their default setting that constantly is depleting. important to understand. that's just the emotional. let's go to the third depleting category and that's the intellectual. What they've realized is, again, we have our conscious brain and our subconscious brain. our subconscious brain is working 95 of the time. We're just in autopilot. We're just doing all kinds of different things we're not even aware of. That doesn't take tons of energy.",

You knew what it was to be unhealthy. Now you're trying to figure out how to be healthy. This is brand new territory for you. And that triggers your fear of the unknown. That requires changes that push you into areas that are scary. That unknown, new skills, all these changes makes life feel a bit chaotic. You feel vulnerable. You feel a little bit powerless.

And now what you have to do in healing shame is saying, I can't base my value on what I do or my external world because what happens if that changes and I'm no longer able to do it. I have to find my value in my internal world, my inherent value. And that, all of these are a process. All of these don't happen overnight. But they are stuff that you begin to work on and you begin to experience the changes. getting the value system. Now, one thing I want to add to that is we talked about sometimes there's a healthy part of getting value from what I do. But if that's the only source of what makes me feel valuable, then it's going to lead me astray. I need to be serving in some capacity, but I have to get value from all kinds of other healthy things, not just from service. that was the third one. The fourth one, if I have value, I treat myself with respect. My limbic brain says I don't feel valuable, I'll treat myself by beating myself up, putting myself down. Cortex says, no, I have value, I will treat myself with value even though I don't feel I have value. you're acting your way to new, healthier feelings. You're saying, I have value, treat myself that way regardless of how I feel. And that is the challenge in dealing with shame. You are choosing to act on what is , what is the truth, even though you don't feel it's that way. you're fighting your feelings by choosing to act by treating yourself with respect. And that can be some of the hardest stuff to do. Treat yourself with respect. bottom line is, as you treat yourself with respect, you start to feel more respect for yourself. You start to feel you can require others to have to treat you with respect. You don't have to put up with their disrespect. And that creates even greater growth for you in dealing with shame. those four we've kind of covered. Now I'm going to bomb my way through a whole bunch of other ones.

    "text": "I'm giving you the Kohl's notes, but it's really key, important stuff. the next one is accepting yourself. Now here's what I want you to understand. When I first started working in the counseling world 30 years ago, what was being talked about all the time was you got to love yourself. Low self-esteem was on everybody's radar, and you got to love yourself. But what they were saying was you have to try to create feelings of love for yourself. And what I found in working with people with tons of shame, they couldn't stir up good feelings. They couldn't stir up good feelings to themselves. if they went to a workshop and they said, look in the mirror and tell yourself you love you and feel all warm and fuzzy to yourself, they're going rolling their eyes going, who is this quack job that's running this class because I can't stir up any positive feelings. And I said, for deeply shamed people, that does not work initially. Where they have to start is not try to get warm feelings to themselves, they have to start by saying, I accept me. I choose to accept the body I was given. I choose to accept the personality I was given. And what does shame say. I don't who I am. Because I think that's the reason I've been neglected and abandoned. I wish I wasn't a shy, quiet person. I wish I was the outgoing leader that was funny all the time. And you wish that. You wish that. You wished for a different personality. You wished for a different face and all those different things. You start by making a choice. I choose to accept this package. I choose to accept the way I was born. Now that is easier said than done. Because you've never done that before. And what's going to happen is once you start to want to get down on yourself because you're feeling your shyness and nobody's wanting to talk to you because you want to sit in a corner all by yourself, you go, what. I'm shy. Instead of seeing that as just a negative, I wonder if there's positives from being shy. And you think about it from a positive perspective. let me give you this. When I was young, I was super shy. I was super analytical.",

Why would be concerned about little old me. He's got stars and galaxies to take care of. He's got all of this stuff to keep on course. He's probably too busy for me.

And the point is, I'm overwhelmed by the fact that such a big cares about somebody little. And what happens in the on Sunday, on a number of occasions, and I put this couple in the book of Job and Isaiah 40, is it purposely tries to help us think about how big is. And in Isaiah 40 it says, think of the things in creation that cause you to stand in awe. looking up at the stars, and it says, oh, those are just a small little thing to. Standing and seeing mountains for the first time, you feel small, you're just overwhelmed with awe. It says, oh , can just put all of that on a scale, it's just dust. And then seeing the ocean and the broadness and the expanse of it, you just feel the sense of awe.

I got caught in a riptide once that scared me to death and I thought I was going to drown. I've learned a healthy fear of the ocean, but I love walking by the ocean. I love being on a cruise ship on the ocean, the bigness, the peacefulness, all of those things. I want you to think about the amazing design that the ocean has in the big picture of our world. And I hope what you'll see is this amazing designer who is designed with great intricacy, an ocean that fulfills all kinds of different functions and that just leaves you with a sense of awe. just to give you one thought, you're going to have to put your thinking caps on with this. Stop and think of every river that goes into the ocean. you've got the Mississippi River, you've got the Amazon River, you keep on going. How many gallons an hour would be going into the ocean. Do you realize that there's no rivers going out of the ocean. had to design an evaporation rate that would match the water coming in. Because if he evaporated too fast, then the ocean would get smaller and smaller. If he didn't evaporate fast enough, the ocean would begin to take over the world. You see. the balance between water coming in and water being evaporated is just amazing when you start to think about who designed that. That is quite something. And then the ocean's going to be , and then the ocean's got to be big enough to allow for the odd glacier to melt or the odd flood to add extra water that year, and the ocean can absorb it because it's big enough. that's kind of where we're going to go. let me just give you some very basic information about the oceans. They cover 75 of our Earth's surface. They're the least explored part of our world. They figure they've probably explored less than 5 of the ocean. That's how big it is on unexplored territory. It holds 97 of the world's water.",

And that's what we mean by depersonalization. you grow up where you wear your mask, the roles that you fulfill, but you've been running from looking at the real you or what you think is the real you. And you get into recovery at 30, 40, 50. 60 years of age and you go, I don't know who I am. And that is really a painful realization for people in recovery. And they can get really down on themselves that they don't know who they are. But that's one of the serious results of disconnecting, especially early in childhood. The second thing is that people say disconnecting doesn't affect me because I just have a problem. I don't know who I am. I just live out of my brain. The reality is, is that even though you're not feeling your emotions, if you have complex trauma, your limbic brain is still running the show. And that's your emotion center. And you are responding to emotions getting triggered without even being aware of it. And you are making decisions once your emotions get triggered. In a nanosecond, you make a decision. And act. And you're not even aware of the dynamics of what is happening. And you end up making bad decisions. the point is this, even though you disconnect from your emotions, your emotions are still running the show. And that is important to understand. The third result of disconnecting is that a lot of people would say, I feel a robot at times. I go through the motions of the world. I feel a robot. I feel I'm a robot. I feel I'm a robot. I feel I'm a robot. I feel I'm a robot. I feel I'm a robot. I feel I'm a robot. I feel I'm a robot. But I also don't feel negative emotions. But I also don't feel positive emotions.

Another way that some people disconnect is through fantasy. I don't my present world. I don't want to connect with it. I don't want to connect with self. let's escape into a world of fantasy where I'm perfect, where everything's the way I want it. And that is a much nicer place to live. And some do that. Others, they just go to, I'm going to be positive. I'm going to think happy thoughts. I'm going to be positive all the time about everything. Always upbeat. And again, they might pride themselves that they aren't influenced negatively by stuff. But for a lot of people, that is a way of disconnecting from what they're really feeling. as soon as they feel something negative, pain, sadness, anxiety, instead of admitting it and dealing with it and resolving it, they just escape to their positive little world and avoid dealing with the problems. And eventually over time, that will cause them a lot of difficulty. Another thing that some people do is they just focus on one emotion. And let's say it's anger. they just say, I'm angry, or they focus on their anger. And to them, then they don't feel any other emotions because they're only allowing themselves. They're only allowing themselves to feel that one. And it's a subtle type of disconnection. Some people disconnect by just being involved in everybody else's problems. Some are just involved in service all the time, helping people out. It's a type of distraction from myself. It's a type of not dealing with my own problems, but I'll focus on everybody else's. Let me just stop and give you a little bit of a test on how to deal with your own problems. And it's a little bit more difficult than you think. I'll give you a little bit of a test. if you were in a car with somebody, or you're in a room with just you and one other person having a conversation, and all of a sudden the other person stopped talking and you couldn't think of anything away to talk about, and there's a moment of silence.

Where they don't even realize what they're doing. Their memory kind of blanks out. And then the next thing is that in complex trauma, anger now pulls you in a negative direction. It pulls you in a negative direction in your thinking. You go to very dark thoughts. It pulls you in a negative direction in your behaviors. What is important for you to understand is that the design of anger was that it was to pull you in a good direction. It was to pull you into problem solving mode and into positive actions. Complex trauma changes all of that. And now when you're triggered, the force that you feel is super powerful, but it's all to negative things. And you're fighting a crisis. You're fighting a current, a gravitational pull that is super strong and very hard to resist. Next, some people coming out of complex trauma find that they become addicted to their anger. They love it and hate it at the same time. They love the power that it gives them. They love the rush. They love how it intimidates others. They love a lot of things about it. they hate the damage that it does. But part of them still needs it. And they become addicted to it just a drug.

But even in homes that their physical needs are met, when their emotional needs aren't consistently met, they feel a certain amount of abandonment. What. What is the thing, the hurt, the wound that gives the worst, greatest pain. I think it's abandonment. Nothing says to you more loudly and more painfully that you are a zero than for people to abandon you. Basically, it says you're worthless. We don't want anything to do with you. It is the loudest statement of a shame message. That you have zero value. It is super, super painful. And what comes out of that is this deep fear of ever being abandoned again. Of a commitment to never be abandoned again. That is loud inside of most people. Loud in the sense that it's big. But they're not. Maybe. They're not aware of it. let me just get you to think about this a little bit further. Because to me it's such an important thing to understand. And to see if it applies to you. See, what happens when a person is abandoned, it alters their identity from positive to negative. From I have value to I have no value. It's the biggest shame message. And the child believes it.

Belief. what do they say in their head. They twist that. They go. They're acting loving to me. They don't really love me. They're just probably using me. They've got some agenda for me. They're saying lots of nice things to me. But they're probably. Saying. Lots of negative things behind my back about me. Wow. They didn't seem super excited to see me today. Yesterday. Their eyes lit up when they saw me. Today's their eyes didn't. Light up. Oh. Oh. They're probably. Getting tired of me. And are getting ready to get rid of me. Or. They probably have many filters in their brain when they talk to me. If they were to take those filters out. They would say all kinds of negative things to me about me. And only a few positive things. But because of all of their filters. They only say positive things to me. They must filter out. Hundreds of negative things that they wish they could say. But they don't want to hurt my feelings. Or. You see them talking to somebody else. And they're laughing and having a good time. And you go. See. They're probably.

But once they begin to understand it, many go, wow, I didn't even realize I did that. And that's really what I want to do today is just help you better understand what we mean when we talk about escaping the fantasy. I need to say up front that there are healthy escapes into fantasy. They're not all unhealthy. let me just give you examples of healthy escapes into fantasy. All of us, young, old, we still go into our imaginations and we imagine a different world. We imagine how things could be better. That can be a very healthy activity. Children love to use their imaginations. They love to make forts, have tea parties. Dress up and imagine that there's somebody else. They love to write stories of imagination. And that can be a very helpful thing for them in developing their brains, in developing their minds and their outlook on life. If you look at our culture today, we escape into watching sports. And some would even imagine when they played that sport. We escape. We escape into movies and we go on Netflix marathons. We escape into novels, books that take us to some other place. And that can be a very healthy thing as part of self-care. We also make plans for our future. We have dreams about what we would one day to do, where we would one day to live. And that can be a healthy thing. Sometimes when we're struggling with very foreign things, we're struggling with our own. We're struggling with our own. We're struggling with our own. We're struggling with our own. We're struggling with our own. In frustrating, difficult circumstances. When life is hard, when we're struggling with depression. We can escape by going back to what life was once. And we can say, what. This, too, will pass. We will one day have things better again. And it's a way of counteracting the negative thinking, the depression that wants to take us into a more business. morbid point of view by saying, no, this is what we can get to again. there is a healthy type of escape. What makes it unhealthy is when it interferes with a couple things.",

And all of a sudden they realize they're not. That is a hard thing to get your brain around. That is a painful reality, more painful than any other reality that they've experienced in their life far. the child, child has a problem. They are betrayed, but they still need this person because they can't meet all their needs yet. And they're going through a lot of pain and betrayal. Part of them wants to run away. Part of them wants to shut down, but they need this person. And they have to adapt in order to still maintain this relationship they can get their needs met. And that's the challenge for the child.

The next thing is know your triggers. if you've been betrayed, you've got a whole bunch of things that will trigger those betrayal feelings. And once those betrayal feelings are triggered, then you're going to feel you're being betrayed again. When probably you're not. But you're triggered and it feels it. you think it must be happening. let's look at this. Let's say somebody comes up to you and says, Oh, I was just talking to somebody and they talked about you. Somebody's been talking behind my back. They probably were saying negative things. And all of a sudden you feel betrayed. And you think that friend betrayed you by talking to this other friend. They might have just been saying good things about you. But it triggers something. Or let's say somebody you've known for a while. All of a sudden reveals a secret to you. That they haven't shared before. And you feel they've been betraying you by having not revealed that secret before. Because that's what happened in your past. But maybe they hadn't revealed that secret because they weren't sure they could fully trust you yet. But it feels betrayal. Or let's say somebody confronts you. And they speak the truth about what you're doing and that it's not. , that feels they don't have your back. That feels they're turning against you. They're not loyal. That feels betrayal. Or let's say you're getting to know a friend. And you really this friend. And all of a sudden you see them over having a chat, a deep conversation with somebody else. That triggers the feelings of betrayal. Or somebody is super nice to you. That triggers feeling you're being groomed. And know your triggers. Because your triggers put you in your limbic brain which has distorted reasoning and lies. And if you realize I'm being triggered, you can get back to your cortex and say, That's what I feel but what is the truth. And that becomes very, very important. The final thing is if you've gone through betrayal trauma, hopefully you realize this is a big, big topic. With huge ramifications into every area of life. I would really encourage you to get help.

    "text": "tonight, part two on shame. what we did in the very first night is understand that shame is a core belief about myself. It's a belief about my identity. And that belief is a negative belief that something's wrong with me. I'm not good enough. I don't feel lovable. I don't feel that I have any value just for being me. I feel inferior, less than is my normal default setting. And we developed what that meant, where it came from, and that for basically every person from complex trauma, they end up with shame. Because once they are neglected or abused or abandoned or their needs aren't consistently met, they conclude it's their fault. I must not be good enough. That's why I'm being neglected and abused. There must be something wrong with me. That's why I'm being neglected and abused. they develop this developing self-concept that is all negative. What I want to do tonight is go into the next part of where does the brain then go once it's reached this conclusion that I'm not good enough. And what I want you to understand up front is this is all happening at a subconscious level. This isn't you sitting down consciously saying, I think I'm no good. What am I going to do about it. This happens in the mind of a small child at a subconscious level. the first thing that you have to understand is the conclusion that comes is not just that I'm not good enough, but there's a second conclusion, which is if the two people that brought me into the world have concluded that I'm not good enough, therefore I can be neglected or abandoned or abused. That means that I'm not good enough. That means that I'm not good enough. That means that I'm not good enough. That means that I'm not good enough. That means that I'm not good enough. That means that anybody that gets to know me is going to abandon me or abuse me or neglect me. I can't have that happen. And with shame develops a fear of abandonment and fear becomes the main emotion that trumps everything else. But at a subconscious level and it's I can't stand the pain of being abandoned, but I'm afraid if people get to know me, I'm going to abandon them.",

    "text": "And if they get to know me, they'll abandon me again and that scares me to death. what am I going to do to never be abandoned. that's where the brain starts to go. the first conclusion is I must hide who I am. Because if they see the real me, they will abandon me. priority number one in my life must be to hide the real me. But the second priority is I don't want to be abandoned. The third priority is I don't want to walk around feeling I'm a nobody. I have to somehow compensate for that feeling that I at least feel I have some value. And then from that comes two other priorities. Though I feel I'm not lovable and though I feel I'm not valuable, I long to be loved. And I long to be respected or to have people treat me as if I have value. here's what begins to happen. I want love and respect, but I must stay hidden. how can I get love and respect without people getting to know the real me. And that becomes the challenge for the brain with a person with shame. And what I want to do tonight is develop that for you that you begin to see what the brain is trying to solve, what solutions it comes up with, and then I want to go into the next part of the lesson. I want to go into some of the ramifications of the solutions the brain comes up with. the brain develops solutions that it thinks are going to fix the problem, but it's limbic brain stuff. It just makes things feel a little bit better, but it makes things worse in the long run. here are some of the very early adaptations or solutions the brain proposes for the shame thing, how to get love and respect but remain hidden. number one, never be vulnerable. Never be authentic. Never let people see the parts of you that would make you weak. don't let them see you cry because then they might look down on you. Don't let them see you sad because then they might think less of you. now you have to hide those weak emotions, not just your personality, but those emotions that can creep out, and then once they're out, people might think less of you.",

I will make them they are always wanting to be with me and have me around because I just make life fun and enjoyable and everybody is happy. Trying to solve their shame. that is one way to look at the roles. Another thing that happens naturally in the brain is this. If I am perfect, people will love me and respect me. If I please everybody, people will love me and respect me. I won't let them see the real me. I will just be a perfectionist or a people pleaser and then I will get the love and the respect that I long for. Now do you see the flaw in this. You get immediate love and respect, but what goes on in your head. You go, you are being a phony. If they knew the real you, they wouldn't be loving you and respecting you. this whole thing is getting you love and respect and it feels good, but it doesn't satisfy because it is an act. that becomes the problem of this. Another solution the brain proposes is I must lie about who I really am. I must lie about things that I do that I think might get me judged. I must keep secrets about struggles I have, failures I have, because I have to hide. And to hide effectively, I have to become a good liar. And I have to become a good secret keeper. again you can see that might work in getting people to you and respect you, but it sure isn't going to make a healthy relationship down the road if you keep lying and keeping secrets all the time. It's going to backfire sooner or later. Other people say, I will build walls around my heart. some people isolate geographically. Who wants to risk relationships with people when you got shame. Because they're going to find you out eventually. I'm not even going to go there. I'm going to have zero relationships. I'm going to become an isolator. Some do that. Not many, but some do. Others say, I want to be with people, but I'm going to isolate by creating walls.",

Has popularity changed him. Because that's changed a lot of people and made them terrible people. it sticks in this story to show us that what David's heart was , but it also shows us what 's heart was. let me tell you about this Mephibosheth guy. David, after 20 years, remembers his best friend was the previous king's son. the previous king was King Saul. His son was Jonathan. And David and Jonathan were close, close friends brothers, we're told. And David made a promise to Jonathan that he would take care of his descendants if Jonathan died. now after 20 years of being a king, he remembers that promise and he says, is there still anyone alive in Saul's family. Because I promised Jonathan I'd show them kindness. And somebody comes and says, Jonathan's son, Mephibosheth, is still alive. Now you have to understand why that was the dumbest question that people thought David should have asked. Because in that culture, the kings passed to their sons and their grandson that you had a dynasty. who would have been the greatest threat to King David's power as the king of Israel. A little guy named Mephibosheth. He was the only one left from King Saul's family, he was the greatest threat to David's power and David's kingdom. for David to say, is there still anybody alive that I can be good to. People are going, David, no. Because the common practice when a king took over a throne is he killed all the descendants of the previous king to make sure there were no threats to his kingdom. And David is doing the exact opposite. He's wanting to find members of the previous king's family in order to help them. now we're told about this Mephibosheth guy. Saul's son, Jonathan, had a son named Mephibosheth who was a cripple since he was a child. When he was five years old, the report came from Jezreel that Saul and Jonathan had died in a battle. that's how Saul's reign ended and David became king. Twenty years earlier, Saul had been in a war Jonathan with him. They died in battle.",

Who's lost everything and you're living in Lodabar. what, how Mephibosheth referred to himself when David finally brought him into the castle. He says, refer to me as a dead dog. And what that meant was, I'm useless. I'm full of shame. I feel I have zero value. I feel my life is a dead dog. And that is what many of you relate to. here is what David's story is saying. How does feel about the Mephibosheth of the world. How does feel about the people who've lost everything and live in fear and brokenness and emptiness with no future prospects. Does love them or say they deserve it. I'm going to wipe them out.

You're going, I hope my will's in good shape here because I'm about to be killed. You're filled with dread. And when he came to David, he bowed low to the ground in deep respect. Don't be afraid, David said. I intend to show kindness to you because of my promise to your father, Jonathan. I will give you all the property, that once belonged to your grandfather, Saul. That's a lot of property. And you will eat here with me at the king's table. In other words, Mephibosheth, I'm giving you back what you once had. You never have to worry about being cared for again. You never have to worry about a meal again. I will meet your needs now. You are going to finally get taken care of the way you should have all along. Mephibosheth bowed respectfully and exclaimed, Who is your servant that you should show such kindness to a dead dog me.",

He got the royal treatment. here's the word I want you to understand to understand 's heart.

I drink because you're a bad kid. And you made, you were made to feel that it's my fault. My parents are struggling or it's my fault. They're getting a divorce. I must be really bad. And you internalize that. Some of you were not allowed to express certain emotions. You're told you're too sensitive. You cry too much. You're too sad. You're always moping around. You're too angry. Nobody to be around you. And you were made to feel that because of you having those emotions, something's wrong with you. You're not good enough. And then, sometimes parents made promises to you that they broke and if they did that repeatedly, you began to feel, wonder if they're breaking the promise because they really don't want to be with me. And you internally, you realize that in a negative way. Now, on the flip side of that is you get children who are spoiled or who have no rules. And people ask me, how could they ever have shame. They just got all kinds of gifts. They had everything given to them. Here's what I've been told by spoiled kids over the years. Number one, my parents tried to buy my love. Instead of giving them what they wanted, they gave them what they wanted. Instead of giving them what they wanted, they gave them what they wanted.

You're really popular if you got a perfect body and a perfect face. what does that say to 90 of our culture today. Young girls coming up, especially when they watch Disney movies and Hollywood, they feel less than. They feel not good enough because Hollywood set a standard for what every girl should attain to as being their normal. Also, if you look at Hollywood, who is it that gets the greatest following and makes the most money. Sports stars, music stars, actors and actresses, people with popularity and a great skill or people that are very wealthy. what are we telling people is the normal. You got to be rich, pretty, and you got to be really, really good looking. You got to be really, really good looking. And you got to be really, really good at either singing, sports, or acting. Otherwise, you're less than. And that reinforces messages that they might already have gotten in home. Now let's go to one more mirror. School. And school actually is two mirrors. Number one, school just as an institution, what does it say is the normal standard of a normal child. You have to be smart. let's say you have a child that works their very hardest, and the best they can ever get is a B-. What does our culture say to that child. You're not quite good enough. And we can end up with a system that is very necessary and very helpful, but it can actually reinforce shame to certain people. And then if you go outside of just the curriculum, and the school institution, to the other students, what do you get as a standard from them. Who are the popular kids. The ones with the great body, the ones who are good in sports, the ones with a car already, the ones that can throw a party, the outgoing ones. And if you don't meet that standard, you're not quite good enough. And then you get the bullies. And that's the other mirror. The people who are stronger than other kids, who put them down on a regular basis.",

He turns 30 years old. He has his baptism and from says, this is my kid. And I am proud of him. Now, hang on to that thought because I'm leading somewhere with that. I want you to think of how that applies to us. In Roman culture, they had a different term for a bar mitzvah and it was called an adoption ceremony. adoption in that culture wasn't necessarily bringing a child from another family who wasn't wanted into your family. That's how we define it. it's a different term. It's a different term. It's a different term. It's a different term for adoption. It's a different term to what adoption ceremony is. It's an adoption ceremony. And for example, if you had an adoption, that wasn't what adoption ceremony was. This was an adoption ceremony for your biological son where you announced that he had become a man and you were giving him all the of manhood. It was a public declaration of how proud you were of your son, just the bar mitzvah. decided to adopt us into his family by bringing us to himself through. This is what he wanted to do and it gave him great pleasure. , with us, we have two types of adoption. First, we're brought from a family into 's family. We're adopted that way. We understand that but then we're adopted a bar mitzvah and takes us unwanted, broken by other people, people that are cracked pots and messed up. He brings us into his family but he doesn't just tolerate us. He stands beside us and he says, this is my kid and I sure love them and I am proud of them doesn't just tolerate us. He doesn't just treat us , I'll put up with you but you sure are a pain. He says, man, if you knew how crazy I was about you, even though nobody else wanted you, even though you were without a family, even though you were super messed up, I already did it with my disciples.",

    "text": "level one is the thing that initially got a person to engage in some type of criminal behavior. usually stealing, boosting something. it could be peer pressure from their friends. Their friends say, oh, I dare you to steal the chocolate bar from the store. And they feel that pressure and they do it. For some people though, stealing was a necessity. They didn't have any food at home. Their parents weren't working or their parents were in addiction. And they had to steal to survive. Others, they grew up poor. their basic physical needs were met, but all the kids at school had nice clothes and nice things, and they didn't have any of those nice things. they got tired of being poor. They wanted some nicer things. And they stole to get some nicer things. Sadly, in some families, parents got their children to steal. they would go into a store and their mom would get the child to steal. they were carrying out their mom or their dad's desires to get free stuff. And then for some kids, the kid that got idolized at school was the bad boy, the boy that stole, the boy that did drugs, all of those things. And they wanted to be the bad boy. They wanted to get kind of validation from the bad boy, the respect of the bad boy. And they engaged in criminal stuff in order to be the bad boy. And then for some, as they look at in their teen years at getting wealthy, getting lots of money, they could go the path of hard work and slow accumulation, but that may not ever get them rich, or they could go into criminal activity, which get them lots of money, fast, a good lifestyle. And that just seemed a more desirous route for them to take. what's important to understand then is Level Two. Why do some kids succumb to peer pressure to steal a chocolate bar where others don't. Why do some kids not care about the bad boy and not want to be him, but others do. What is understand issues that make a child vulnerable to fall into criminal activity. That becomes a key thing to understand. it's more than just peer pressure. There's something deep underneath that makes them vulnerable to peer pressure.",

You're taking from other people you're going to hurt other people there has to be the second stage which is a moral neutralization and this is a very complex stage because you're playing mind games to justify doing it to get rid of the internal conflict that you're feeling the cognitive dissonance that you're feeling Brady again says the destructive and self defeating behavior that criminals experience is fueled by irrational thoughts the more a criminal engages in the activity the more criminals become skilled practitioners in the art of self deception some of the things that they do the mind games are called mollification and that is they downplay the seriousness of the crime or justifying or excuse making. And also with that, they blame others. They justify their poor choices. They make all kinds of excuses. they always have a good reason for why they're doing it, but it's not really the real reason why they're doing it. They would never admit that. And some of the s or the mollification that happens is, if I don't do it, somebody else will. somebody's going to sell drugs anyway, might as be me and I can make the money. Or I steal from people, but it doesn't hurt anybody because they have insurance. they're going to get it all back. Or, I'm not hurting anybody. I only steal things. It doesn't hurt anybody. Or they claim it's because others do it as. Or others have done far worse than what I'm doing, mine's not that bad. they have all kinds of excuses. And they're going to sell drugs anyway, might as be me and I can make the money. there's all kinds of reasons why they're doing it. it's a very strong argument that people would be guilty of trying to justify or mollify their behavior. Part of what is happening is that they fail to consider the injury to others. They fail to consider that, yes, others might have insurance, but they have to go through. They've been violated, that they have had somebody take their stuff. Their insurance rates are now going to go up. The cost of goods is now going to go up for everybody.

They're constantly having secrets, not giving you the full story. their whole life becomes very much around lying, dishonesty. I think it's important to understand that there's an antisocial behavior that's often very much underneath criminal behavior. And this might be helpful because you can begin to spot this in children. antisocial behaviors are disruptive behaviors that hurt others, that hurt self, that disregard rules, that violate love. it's a child that is not able to connect. And they just get to the point where they lash out. They want to hurt somebody. There's a ton of anger that just needs to be vented. And they start this very isolated behavior, antisocial behavior, venting of anger, hurtful, getting back, because there's much pain inside. Now antisocial behavior tends to go on a spectrum from very severe to less severe, but it's all antisocial behavior. here's some of the signs and symptoms of an antisocial personality disorder that you can look for. a disregard for and wrong. Rules don't apply to me. Don't care. Persistent lying or just coming to a place where you're trying to exploit other people. Using charm to manipulate people. being very charming, but it's all manipulation. It's not genuine love at all. Intense egotism feeling superior and needing to display that. Recurring difficulties with the law. And a person with antisocial behavior, what they're seeing is basically, comes out of severe abuse and neglect. And that means they have and have experienced and enter into poor relationships, abusive relationships. And then another sign is just irresponsible work behavior. just not doing a good job, not showing up, being late, just not being responsible. And then repeatedly violating the of others using intimidation, dishonesty, misrepresenting the facts. They just don't care about others. They don't love others the way they love themselves. There's a double standard that I treat myself very different from and I want to be treated very different from how I treat you. Hostility, lots of anger issues that can end up in aggression. Aggressiveness, violence, lack of empathy, lack of remorse, unnecessary risk-taking, dangerous behaviors, and then a failure to learn from negative consequences. they get caught. There's negative consequences. They just don't learn from it. They just go back to it.",

    "text": "again, what you see is antisocial behavior comes out of deep complex trauma, deep shame, and a narcissist. And that's a narcissistic thing. all of those characteristics are characteristics of a narcissist. The next characteristic of a person with criminal behavior is what has become known as the very good person stance. And basically they have to keep telling themselves that they're basically a very good person. They love their dog. They love their family. They love their elders. they have very sentimental feelings to children, to animals, to their family. To the elderly. And they go, see, I'm a good person. And it's a type of way of denying looking at themselves totally and to see themselves accurately. They just see one part of themselves and try to make that their whole self. And then they use that to be able to justify continuing to do criminal behavior. , I'm still, I'm a really good person. I do this a little bit, but that's all. I'm a good person. I'm a good person. Then often with in criminal behavior, there's a criminal pride that develops. And that is just, they're kind of proud of what they do. They think it makes them better than others. I think they're smarter than others. They got more money than others. there's a real sense of superiority that develops, but what is important is they have to maintain this image. That they are superior to everybody. That criminal pride is huge for them. And often with that is there's a sense that they're unique, that they're just special. They're one of a kind. They're different from other people. They're in a class, all of their own. what you see from that is there's just this massive shame that is going into this highly overcompensating superiority stance. But with that, there's a sense of superiority. And with that, what they've found is that criminal pride, that uniqueness is there. But there's moments that they have what is called zero state where they actually feel their shame. They feel a zero. They feel absolutely worthless. They're not being productive in positive ways in society. They're not loving people. They're actually hurting society. They're hurting others. And they just feel terrible about themselves.

Gives them that feeling of power and control. Anger we've talked about is again, a huge part of their life. A deep of anger from childhood that they're still rebelling against the system. They're still acting out. And then that can show up in their personal relationships where they become violent. If they don't get their own way, they intimidate others. That's their way of gaining and maintaining control and power. Anger becomes a tool that they use all the time. Then often with criminals, they've shut down empathy for others, but they're still very sentimental. Sentimental about their moms. Sentimental about their pets. Sentimental about babies. Sentimental about their new, I'm in love. And now I'm going to buy roses and gifts and romance this person. they, in some ways they feel they're very loved. They're very loving, but it's very narrow in its scope. Most people with criminal behavior where it becomes an addiction, a way of life. There's a ton of energy that they have. And they get an idea and all of a sudden they have a high level of mental activity, thinking about it, planning for it. And they're just bursting with energy. They can't sit still. Next one is. Very significant. And there's tons of fear, fear of getting caught fear that their life is not going to amount to anything. They have fear of injury, fear of death, fear of being disrespected, fear of losing face, fear, fear, fear, fear, but they will never admit that they're afraid. They think they're afraid of nothing. They're actually afraid of experiencing the sensation of fear. they have shut down fear much that they don't feel at a conscious level, but it rules their subconscious.

They're, they're trying to be respectable in their community, but over here they're selling drugs. They're stealing. They're doing all kinds of stuff.

I need to put my needs out there. I need to express my desires. I need to try things and do things. All of a sudden they feel guilty. All of a sudden fear kicks in. I'm going to get rejected. I'm going to get judged. I'm going to get punished. And for them to come out of invisibility into healthy expression of needs creates tremendous fear. It is a very difficult thing. And they often feel guilty doing that. just be aware of that. But the second thing that can happen when a child is not validated is that they then go to developing a hyper need for validation. A hyper need for approval. A hyper need for recognition. It becomes this black hole that can never be satisfied. An itch that just can't be scratched sufficiently. with attention seeking, this is important to understand. A child that is neglected, they will do things to gain attention. They will make attention seeking behaviors. It's not to be bad. It's because they want to connect. It's a bid for connection. It's please notice me that you will connect with me. it's driven by this huge need for connection that every child has. But if the parents don't connect and then judge the child for the attention seeking behavior, the child begins to go, I'm bad. Nobody wants me because I'm not good enough. shame develops. This deep self identity that sees itself as negative. That sees itself as bad, unlovable, not good enough. And then what comes out of that is, but I still want to connect. I still want to be seen. I still want to be noticed. I don't care if it's in a good way anymore. I just want to be seen. Hopefully people will connect. But if they don't, oh , I just need to be seen. now attention seeking behavior can go into very many maladaptive forms. Just wanting to be noticed.

In the other path where I say, let's go back to unhealthy, I will get short-term pleasure, but even greater long-term pain. I will get pain either way. My limbic wants to go back to short-term pleasure. It doesn't want to factor in long-term pain. I need to get to my cortex and say, hey, I want long-term pleasure, joy. I will endure short-term pain. It's way better than ever increasing greater pain. There's another piece that happens here. Is that whenever I transition from an old unhealthy normal that's been my normal for years, my default setting, to a new normal, it feels wrong. if you've been a people pleaser for years, you've suppressed your desires for years, you've told yourself that it's to suppress your desires and put everybody ahead of you, that's what love means. Now when you stand up for yourself and say, no, my needs matter just as much as yours, I need to be loved better. I need to be loved just as much as I love in order for it to be a healthy relationship, that feels selfish. That feels wrong. When I set boundaries with family, it feels I'm disloyal to family.

And then there's another piece that happens. when you deal with your people pleasing, the issue that you're wanting to change, and you begin to explore it, you begin to realize the reason I people please is because I have shame underneath.

There's been many negative consequences that come out of these changes. Maybe it's better to go back to the way things used to be. Maybe it's better to just go back to conform to what everybody wants. Then I'll be happy. Then everybody else will be happy. Surely that's the way to go. And they reach a fork in the road. And to change, it means short-term pain, opposition, people upset with you. It leads to all kinds of dealing with stuff and fear that aren't pleasant to deal with. But there is a pro and it's long-term. Eventually it's going to lead to a better life. It's going to lead to greater joy. But the other fork of the road is, if I go back to the way things used to be, I'll get short-term pleasure. Everybody will be happy with me again. Everything will look good again. But the con is I will get long-term pain even greater. the point is, it doesn't matter what path I'm going to choose, I'm going to get pain. In the healthy path, I'm going to get short-term pain, but long-term pain. I'm going to get short-term pain, but long-term pain. Healthiness, joy. In the other path where I say, let's go back to unhealthy, I will get short-term pleasure, but even greater long-term pain. I will get pain either way. My limbic wants to go back to short-term pleasure. It doesn't want to factor in long-term pain. I need to get to my cortex and say, hey, I want long-term pleasure, joy. And it's better to evoke kapila, which means to say, hey, I'm looking forward to spending less time on eating things. I'm trying to get when I hear shrimp, I might need this again and that was pretty nice.",

All of them, their ultimate desire was the safety of the child. They just used the tools they had to tell lies, to get angry, to lash out, to become invisible, to be funny all the time.

That's probably the best that I can do. if I'm not happy with myself, if I'm in a relationship where I abuse, but I get love once in a while, that's, I'll just have to put up with that and accept that because that's the best I'm going to get. you get the two sides of shame that get attracted to each other and end up in a relationship. And both are necessary to keep the relationship going. Do you realize if the person who takes the abuse and says, I'm content with a few crumbs, they could have left. Many, many times, but they stay there. I work with addicts every day. And the question I often want them to consider is, if you look inside of yourself, you are a whole bunch of desires and hormones and chemicals and needs. And those needs and desires and drives are all in competition with each other. you got a desire for sleep, for food, for sex, for relationships, for position, for power, all in competition. In a healthy person, there's one drive, one need that trumps everything else, and that is love. I will have a sex drive, but never to the point where it violates love. Love will trump that. What happens in an abuser is things begin to trump love. And as soon as something, begins to trump love, you can become an abuser. And we all have the potential to be abusive because we all struggle every day with competing desires. And sometimes they do trump love. We get selfish. An abuser is the things that consistently trump love are there all the time. And that becomes the main part of their life. Love still pokes out. Once. And a while. But other forces are the more powerful forces in their life. let me give you a couple examples. if a person has this sex drive, it can become a lust thing. If it trumps love, guess what you have. I want my sex drive gratified. I don't care if I hurt you. That is where the sex drive has trumped love. And then sex, then becomes abusive. It becomes using of other people. Second one, greed. We all have this desire. I want money. I want position.",

But if it's healthy, I will love will always win out over my desire for money that I will never violate you in order to get money. I won't. I won't use you or steal from you. Same as lust for power. Think of image. If you grew up in a home where image was more important than anything else. When you went out in public, you knew that mom and dad weren't really loving you. That was all fake, but you had to keep an image. And if you didn't maintain the image while you were out there in public, you got it when you got home. Because what your parents were saying is, my image is more important than loving you. if you don't maintain my image, I will hurt you. it overpowered love. The same is true with resentments. If we let them take over, they will begin to overpower love. I can have a hurt, be hurt by somebody else and be angry. But if I'm healthy, I will not ever use my anger in a way to hurt you. Love will win. I will be respectful. I will work my anger out in a loving way. But if I give into resentment, I want to hurt you. I don't care about love anymore. Then shame. If you think of being with an abusive person who's got lots of shame, what happens is if you ever expose to in public their weakness or make them look bad, you're going to pay for it. Hiding shame is their highest priority. And you can take comfort, ease, control. If those are your priority that overpowers love, you will end up being abusive. if you get all kinds of those things, then you become even more likely to become abusive. if anything trumps love and that thing becomes threatened, I become abusive. that's the underlying forces. part of why I want you to think about this in these terms is some people's response to people are abusive is just stop doing it. As if that's supposed to make them just stop doing it. The reality is they can't stop doing it till they deal with their shame until they get those other things that have trump love to be under love.",

And then if they still don't change, then you enforce the consequence. that in my mind is kind of what you have to have clear in your mind that you don't end up staying in this too long. And here's why I say that. The longer you stay in a sick relationship with a sick person, who isn't willing to own their stuff, the sicker you become. It wears you down. It takes its toll on you. this isn't just about getting rid of a jerk. This is about protecting yourself and keeping yourself growing. , number three. Some people will say, but I love them. What I have learned over the years is there's a lot of definitions of love that are really bad misunderstandings of love. people think the loving thing to do is this, but that's really not a very loving thing to do. I want to give you five common misconceptions that people have that cause them to stay in relationships when it should have been ended a long time ago. Number one. Love means you make sacrifices for people. You put your needs aside at times in order to meet their needs. And you serve other people. That is a wonderful definition of love. But in an intimate relationship or a friendship, both have to be living by that definition. If you're the only one making sacrifices and serving, and the other's not doing any of that, that is not love to continue in that. Cause what you're doing is enabling them to stay immature and irresponsible and selfish. And you're giving up all your needs and doing all the sacrificing. That will eventually make you sick. Second. While love means humility, it means submitting yourself to another person and to another person. And that's what love is. It means submitting yourself to another person and their needs. And what many people don't realize, that definition contains, love means becoming a doormat. Love means letting people walk all over you. Love means tolerating wrong, unloving, abusive behavior. Love means not standing up for yourself. Do you want to know what true humility is. I don't think I'm better than anybody, but I'm not less than anybody either.",

    "text": "I will stand up for myself if somebody wants to make me less than. love is not being a doormat. Humility and love is, I stand up for me, just as much as I stand up for you. Third one. Many people have an idea that love is always syrupy, sweet, kind, just be nice to people, all of that stuff. You never get angry. You never get harsh. That is very unloving in their mind. I don't know if you've been a parent for very long, but if you're sweet to your kids constantly and you never have to be harsh or say no, then you're not probably a very good parent. Because we all need a tough side to love. If we don't have a tough side, we will just keep pushing the boundary to see what we can get away with. And if you're still sweet and nice to us and cleaning up after us, we will begin using you and abusing you as long as you'll put up with it. love has to have a tough side and a gentle soft side in order to be a whole package love. Number four. Many people think love means you never set boundaries. I remember early in marriage, once in a while people would show up at our door and just want to come in. And I just had a busy day. And I said, sorry, you can't come in. And my wife would go, you're being rude and unkind. I go, if I let everybody in, I'll burn myself out. love is a tough side. And I think that's what we need to do. Love sets boundaries. Love says, this is. Outside of here is not. And if you go outside of here, there will be consequences. I will not tolerate lying. to be a loving parent, you say to your child, if we're going to have a healthy relationship, there's going to be no lying. if you lie, there will be consequences. And love is fighting for boundaries that reinforce love. And keep it healthy. It has to have boundaries. What happens for a lot of people is that they set boundaries in recovery and people break those boundaries and then they don't enforce the consequences.",

    "text": "it's important to understand it's number one, necessary to set boundaries, but number two, it's just as important to enforce the boundary. And that is where many people struggle because to enforce the boundary means I enforce a consequence for breaking the boundary. And that leads many people to say, oh, I couldn't do that. That would be too hard. I might hurt their feelings. And I just couldn't do that. And I go, what you're saying is you're going to let people walk all over you, use you and abuse you, and you're never going to stand up for yourself. And what is loving. that is important. And then the fifth misconception is forgiveness. And what people think is if I forgive somebody who's hurt me badly, that automatically I just start trusting them again or I let them totally back into my life and I don't set any boundaries with them and I always give them more chances. That is not forgiveness. Forgiveness, if a person's hurt me badly, what forgiveness means is I'm not going to take revenge into my own hands. But that doesn't mean I'm not going to set a boundary with you and not let you into my life again until I have ample evidence that you've changed. Then I'll let you in. forgiveness doesn't mean let everybody walk back all over you and act nothing happened in the first place. those are common misconceptions. let me go to some facts about damaged relationships that I've seen over the last 15 years in my field as a counselor with people in addiction and from trauma. number one, a very common scenario for people in addiction is they cheat on each other. And I get couples all the time coming to ask me, my partner cheated on me, I cheated on them, can we make it work again. And what I basically say is this, how long do you think it would take for you to trust them again. If they are really working on themselves, how long do you think before you would be able to confidently trust them again. And they stop and they, you can tell the wheels are turning and I'll go make it simple for you, two to five years. Maybe more realistically for some, ten years.",

Or they might threat you physically. If you get rid of me, you'll be sorry. I will make your life. I will do all kinds of things to hurt you. And the fear, causes you to take them back and give them another chance. you have to be prepared for that. And then some, they will start texting you a billion times a day. Sending you flowers. Sending you poems they've written about their love for you. Showing up at your work with roses. All of those things. Trying to wear you down. Trying to get you to, give them an opportunity. Now let me give you this. And I've sadly seen it happen over and over again. Many people from complex trauma are attracted to narcissists. And narcissists is, I'm the most wonderful thing in the world. You adore me. And you are lucky to have me. And I own you. , you break up. now you're making them look bad. And they can never be made to look bad. they will manipulate, manipulate to let you back in. Let's say you let them in. You train them. That manipulation gets you to change the boundary. They mess up again, you kick them out. And they manipulate their way back. What you taught them was this. Your no doesn't mean no. It means try harder. now you really are determined to get rid of them. you've trained them for years to keep manipulating. you have to be ready for a long battle of sticking to your guns. Don't open the door a crack. It has to remain sealed shut. Before they get the message that there's no future here. And that is hard to do. let me just end with some of the tough parts in ending a relationship. If you have kids together, there's always the concern about the kids. Let me say this. For you to stay together, you hurt the kids. For you to split, you hurt the kids. There's no win-lose option. They're both bad options. What you're trying to decide is what's the best of the bad options. And usually, it's the splitting up.",

And I just smile when they tell me that. Because what they mean is, could we still go out for coffee once a week as friends. And for many of them, what that means is, can we go out once a week and we're back on. Then it'll be twice a week, then I'll be texting every day, and then it's serious again. some people, not many, some people are able to say, it's done, I'll let you be friends, here's the boundaries. Some are able to keep it that way, and some are able to keep it there, but not many. And for many people, it's done and not even friends. Because they're not strong enough to handle coffee once a week. It will suck them back in, because the emotions will all start up again, and before it, it's back on. Third thing is, what I find in dealing with people is they want to end the relationship, but really they're afraid to end it. the reason they don't end it is fear. All kinds of fears. Number one, fear of being judged. If you get a divorce, oh, what will all the people think. there's that fear. Many are afraid of being alone. They can't stand being alone, but many are afraid that this is another failure in my relationship, my relationship life. I may never get a relationship that's healthy. That's scary. And there's a fear of never ending up in a healthy relationship. And then many people say, I can't break up because I'll hurt their feelings. their concern is hurting the feelings of the other person. what I say to them, you would rather hurt your feelings about yourself than to hurt their feelings. That is out of balance. , you might hurt their feelings. They'll get over it. But if you stay, you hurt yourself for months and years.",

What I find interesting, if you were to follow my life as a counselor, is probably 75 of the time when couples come to see me, I say, I don't see any hope here. Probably be a good idea to just talk about ending it. Now it's bad when a counselor, 75 of his advice say it's post. Get over it. There's very few times when I say, keep working.

Otherwise, free will means nothing if I only have one option. created us with the ability to love or to hurt.

He is not a that comes and stops every person who's about to do something wrong and say I'm going to take away your free will for a while and I'm going to make you a robot again because you can't hurt.

And we're told that they start singing. Now, you would be singing the blues. We don't know what Paul's saying, but the point is this. Paul is saying, I don't understand what you're doing here in my life. I don't understand why you've led me here. But I choose to trust you. And how I will show that I'm trusting you is I'm going to sing thanks to you. I'm going to praise you through song. he's singing along, trusting. And then this earthquake hits out of the blue. The earthquake is severe that it starts popping all the doors of the prison cells open. There's much movement happening. Basically, all the prisoners could go free. Now, here's where it gets really fascinating. In that world, the prison master was in charge of the prisoners. And if a prisoner escaped, the prison master had to take the penalty that prisoner had. if that prisoner was waiting to be put to death, the prison master would be put to death. That's the way they did it. the prison master, that was pretty good job motivation. To do a good job and make sure nobody escaped. But now all the prison doors are open. Paul's included. Now, you think Paul would be up there saying, boys, I'll lead the way. Let's get out of here. You want to know what Paul did. And as far as , Paul was a short little bald guy who was a bit hunched over and bowlegged. This little guy is saying, Nobody leave. And he took charge of all the prisoners. I don't know how they ever sat there and said, Yes, sir. Yes, sir. To him. But they did. And the prison master comes down rushing from his house down into the prison, expecting to have all the prisoners gone.",

    "text": "And as soon as he gets in the prison and he sees the doors open and he doesn't see Paul with the prisoners, he goes, It's all over for me. He gets his sword out and he's ready to kill himself. He says, Let's just get it done with. And Paul catches him and says, Stop. Nobody is in the prison. Nobody has escaped. And the prison keeper goes, What kind of man is this. Who does this. And he goes, There's something about this guy I need to know about. And he comes and he falls at Paul's feet. And he says, Please show me how to be with. And Paul has got the perfect opportunity. follow the leading. Let shut doors. Realize that he might lead you to a darker place or a hard place. Trust him in that. Allow him to work circumstances that eventually it all starts to make sense. And that prison guy became the first man follower of in Philippi. And then from that, he got his family listening to Paul, his friends. None of that would happen unless Paul was there. None of that would happen unless Paul ended up in prison and made sure an earthquake happened. Paul wasn't there long in advance saying, I know exactly what's going to happen over the next two months. He just knew the next step. And often it got real confusing. But he kept trusting. He kept following. And brought it all together eventually. you're not going to know the results of 's guidance away. It may be years. Until you look back and go, Wow. I see it now. I couldn't see it then. let me just give you another illustration to end this up. It's a common story that's been told of a beautiful Persian rug. as you looked at it, there was these intricate designs that were all blended together. And it was absolutely breathtaking. And a boy was sitting there with his dad looking at it one day. And he said, Dad, this is stunning. And Dad says, Let me show you something. He turned the carpet over to the other side. And what he saw. All these disjointed threads. There was no pattern. There was knots. There was endings here. It just looked chaotic. And he says, Often in life, you just see the chaos part.",

    "text": "Commitment to you might be defined just as somebody attuned to meeting my needs some other ones that people have is they grew up where parents didn't do anything fun with them and for them commitment is you do fun things together or parents who broke their promises commitment is you keep your promises or parents who didn't set good boundaries or enforce those boundaries or parents who didn't stick together through tough times and for you commitment is sticking together no matter what or you had parents that cheated on each other the emphasis for you is commitment is you're faithful sexually to your partner parents who didn't fulfill their responsibilities or parents who didn't make sacrifices and for you commitment is all about sacrifices and responsibility all of that just to say be aware as you think about this topic of your early definitions of what commitment means now having said that i want to then go to k what does commitment mean what is a full picture that will help us understand commitment because you can't build trust unless there's somebody in your life who's committed to you commitment i want you to understand is the essential part of your relationship the first component is commitmentじゃあ when an enriched when you wanna grow together go out there and spread the and have fun doing them and in that way can you come to that middle point and how you reach those sentiments now when you have someone contacting you for a while there's always there's still grass between to a beyond a certain point and that is important to understand commitment is continuing to do the thing even when you don't feel it's continuing to follow the same priorities principles course of action at all times regardless of the circumstances now in complex trauma it's very important to understand that in light of the limbic brain versus the cortex brain commitment will never get carried out if you live only in your limbic brain because that's your child brain and what does the child brain say I will do something if I feel it but if I don't feel it I'm not going to do it that's not going to carry out a commitment it's going to be a commitment to the child brain and that's what commitment is and that's a commitment if you only do it when you feel it and to maintain commitment you have to go to your cortex that says I'm going to do this on days I feel it but also on days I don't feel it what is involved it's hanging in there when life gets hard and overwhelming it's continuing to do the thing day after day even though you're not seeing immediate results it's the farmer who plants the seed waters it weeds it but is not seeing results yet there's a waiting time but you're still doing the stuff but then with commitment there's an element of exclusivity that you are faithful sexually and emotionally now foreign to have a healthy relationship with my wife I have to be committed to her but if I'm committed to her then that means I can't have that type of relationship with any other women in the world it excludes other people if I'm going to have a healthy relationship with my children I got to be committed to them and that means I can't be using all of my time doing other things and having tons of other relationships with other people because that would take away from my commitment to my children just having a committed relationship means I have to exclude relationships with others and it means I can't say yes to all kinds of activities I have to start saying no to a whole bunch of activity because that will prevent me from carrying out my commitment to my children and I might be saying no to very worthwhile activities but I have to in order to maintain that commitment the next thing that happens in a committed relationship is it's the understanding that your needs are just as important as mine that we are going to work together to make sure both of our needs are being met I'm going to meet some of my own needs but I'm going to need your help with others you're going to meet most of your needs but you're going to need my help with others that then means at times we're going to have to make sacrifices at times we're going to have to give when we're not feeling we're getting anything back away sacrifice becomes part of this but then it also means I'm not going to abandon you now this is really important for people from complex trauma because what happens in complex trauma when you don't feel somebody's there for you to help you through a difficult situation is you feel abandoned but then what happens is you believe that you must be the reason they abandon you must have many flaws you're not worth it you then abandon yourself you don't even yourself and what happens now in being committed to yourself is you're saying to the wounded part of you I won't abandon you again I am committed to working through this stuff with you the next thing that's part of commitment is open honest communication and no secrets we're going to share and talk honestly but then it means accepting the person that you're in the relationship with where they're at their personality you accept them as they are and you form an attachment with them a secure attachment that means you're a Safe person that means you're attuned to how they're doing you're aware of their emotions that means that you care about their pain just as much as you care about your own pain that means you work hard through your challenge through operation and those issues that will have paid off that can be THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING WHEN YOU'VE BEEN SUPPOSED TO 이 מאוד means you work hard to get to understand them that you get them that you get to know them intimately their deepest dreams passions fears wounds you want to understand them that's part of commitment it also involves you desire what is best for them and it means you are all in many people from complex trauma when they go into a relationship they go in with always needing an escape hatch if this gets a little bit tough I'm out of here with commitment is I've got to know you and I'm prepared to commit to you which means I'm all in I am going to give myself to this I'm jumping in with both feet and what that means is not only do I choose you today I'm going to choose you again tomorrow and I'm going to choose you the next day I'm going to choose you over and over and over again more than that commitment means we're going to have problems but we're going to work them out we're going to resolve them and to do that I have to be willing to own my part you have to be willing to own your part we both have to be willing to change that's the only place where commitment will work to produce healthy people as we have problems commitment means we're committed to respect each other even in the problems I am not going to disrespect you further I am going to be willing to go to being vulnerable as we work through problems and that means I'm going to expose weaknesses to you I'm going to be authentic I'm going to share who I really am with you and then when it comes to making decisions I am going to do my thinking not just that the decision benefits me but that it benefits both of us I'm going to think for two when I am thinking about a decision and I want it to benefit you just as much as it benefits me I am going to show up on days that I am tired hurt angry stressed out distracted I'm still choosing to be present and to love even on those difficult days now think of where did commitment begin it began by thinking this person has value this person means a lot to me and what I am going to do moving forward is continue to see you and treat you as somebody is having great value to me that therefore means that yes I will acknowledge weaknesses that you have but I am not going to focus on them with a desire to tear you down because if I focus only on the negatives in you will lose value in my mind which will cause me to have trouble maintaining my commitment to keep my commitment growing I have to continue to choose to treat you with respect to see you as having great value to me and then for people with complex trauma commitment means fighting through fears that are going to be triggered as the relationship deepens as the relationship deepens there's gonna be a fear of oh and I do care but that's not trying drew on my commitments fear every moment I am alwayshuh hear we have to save that need to serve me to see myero OF USE the fear our日本ese care is really about improving the shape and government oh, they're getting to know me better, or are they going to abandon me.",

    "text": "And your natural instinct at that time will be, let's just sabotage this relationship. But commitment says, no, I am going to press through that fear, and I am going to not sabotage this relationship. I am going to continue to be present and to be authentic and work through my fears. That is tough. those are 26 characteristics of commitment. Somebody said this, nothing is sexier than someone who can face temptations and have the level of maturity to say, this isn't worth losing what I have. commitment is multifaceted. Now let's go to trust. you need commitment to build trust. But, once trust is there, it can easily be broken. And what is surprising to many people is that trust is often slowly chipped away at until it's finally gone. And the things that slowly can chip away at trust are often small little things that even seem insignificant. let me just give you some of the things that can slowly chip away, at trust in a relationship. If you are a person who repeatedly says that you're going to be there at a certain time, and you never show up on time, that very slowly can erode trust. Or, if you are in circumstances and you don't make your partner a priority, you put other things ahead of them, that can begin to erode trust. If you're only interested in trust, if you're only interested in your partner when you want something from your partner, sex or something else, that will erode trust. If you're not there for your partner when they're hurting, or when they're sick, that will erode trust. If you don't keep your promises, if you don't contribute to the -being of your family, you're just off in your own little world and the family can do what it wants, that begins to erode trust. That begins to erode trust. That begins to erode trust. That begins to erode trust. Or another way to say that is, if your approach to your family or relationships is me rather than we, that will erode trust. , if you are quite content that your partner take care of 75 of the responsibilities of the family, and you just to spend time with your friends, doing your hobbies, and you just do a little bit with the family, that's going to erode trust big time.",

    "text": "Now they're eating too much, they're sleeping too much they're avoiding things they're procrastinating and it's just starting to happen and they don't know why because they've been disconnected from all of that and if they keep giving into that and letting those old behaviors continue pretty soon they're going to be an even darker place pretty soon they're going to be even more depleted and it's super dangerous for them but then what happens to many people when they finally clue in i'm overeating again and i'm doing all of my old behaviors here what's going on oh i must be depleted all i need is a day at the spa that'll fix everything i just need self-care and they go for a day at the spa and it doesn't help a whole lot it helps a little but it doesn't help a whole lot it helps a little bit but it doesn't help a whole lot it helps a little bit but it doesn't help a whole lot that's what i want us to understand we need self-awareness around when we're depleted the things that deplete us but we also need self-awareness around am i meeting consistently my 12 needs because if i'm not i'm going to become depleted those are crucial let me let me let me develop what depletes us and there's been some amazing research done around this that i find quite fascinating and i'm going to share it with you we all most readily think of being depleted tired or exhausted because of physical labor because of physical work about doing too much i'm just exhausted when we think of depletion we tend to think of it in four ways and we think of it in four ways and we think of it in four ways and we think of it in physical activity terms let me develop that and it's partly but there's a whole bunch more things other than physical that deplete us and that's where we're going to get to but let me give you a bigger context here any time we've got our sympathetic nervous system which is our activity and our parasympathetic nervous system which is our rest they need to be in balance if we are going to keep our gas tanks full to stay healthy not burnout if my sympathetic nervous system is going too much and my parasympathetic nervous system is not allowed to bring in rest and healing and rejuvenation i eventually am going to become depleted and for people from complex trauma this is why we become depleted and depleted easily because we're used to being in our sympathetic nervous system all the time because we're in survival mode and it's easy to slide back into that's been the default setting for years and big picture what we're looking at with depletion is learning when i'm in my sympathetic nervous system when i'm back in survival modes type of stuff and not in my parasympathetic in the balance that is the big picture of what we're looking at now let me just say this when we go into our sympathetic nervous system it actually for many people feels good because we get an adrenaline rush we get more energy we feel more alive we don't feel depleted and we go this is a good thing but what you don't realize is if you don't get to the parasympathetic in the balance being in your sympathetic nervous system you're not going to be in the balance if you're in a parasympathetic too much feels good for now but it's slowly taking its toll and using up gas that you're not replenishing and pretty soon you're going to burn out you're going to be depleted let me give you some of the physical things that they're finding besides just overworking over go go all the time not getting enough sleep what they're finding is a person who loves multitasking and they're always wanting to multitask that takes a lot of energy and it can deplete us more quickly than a person who just does one thing at a time another thing they're finding is people that live in cluttered messy spaces without realizing that's actually depleting them that's taking energy out of them just to live in that space another one is being cooped up inside all alone you don't go out you don't connect you don't interact with people you don't do anything social you just stay cooped up that takes a lot of energy other ones not drinking enough water dehydration another one people who live with chronic physical pain just living with pain take a ton of energy those people get depleted people that are fighting a sickness an infection a virus get depleted because it takes a lot of energy to fight those things people recovering from surgery where their bodies doing a ton of healing physically are very tired and then people who go through a major move or a major change in life job wise moving to a different city a new relationship a child moving away from home a new baby ton of energy required and they can become very depleted because of that those are all physical things but what i want you to realize is that's only a small part of what depletes us one of the things that depletes us probably more than anything is emotions let's talk about that because for people from complex trauma who've suppressed emotions disconnected from emotions they don't realize how much energy emotions take and what we find for many people who take our lift program or react program is after a couple weeks they're just exhausted and they go why i haven't been doing anything and they're still thinking in terms of physical activity is the only thing that makes you tired and i go you're doing human's work when it comes to emotions now and you're exhausted because of all the emotional work that you're doing and that's a new concept for them things that deplete us in the emotional world and it's fascinating to me what they're finding out is when you have a physical activity and you're tired and you're exhausted and you're exhausted and you're you have stuff emotions all the time you've got anger coming up you stuff it down you've got fear coming up you stuff it down that's intense emotional stuff that you're stuffing if you go through loss and you stuff it down it's holding a beach ball underwater it takes a lot of energy to stuff down an intense emotion and you get depleted because of that second one with that is every time you feel an intense emotion anger deep fear huge amount of stress hate deep sense of injustice those are intense emotions and they all involve cortisol any intense emotions that brings about cortisol you will be exhausted afterwards they take a ton of energy to do that you're not going to be exhausted you're not going to be exhausted you're not going to be exhausted and you're not going to be exhausted and that's the key to this and that's the key to this is that you have to have a lot of energy just feeling and expressing very intense emotions requires a lot of energy next one i've already kind of referred to and it's processing old wounds old trauma that you've been suppressing for years but now you're bringing it out and talking about it processing it crying about it healing feeling the emotions of it that's exhausting that is hard work and it is very depleting if you're in a recovery program expect to be tired another one is if you're carrying an intense resentment towards somebody that takes a lot of energy another one if you have a conflict an intense conflict with somebody you can expect you're going to be exhausted afterwards because that intense conflict took a ton of energy next one if you're sitting in an intense emotion that can't quickly be resolved you've just lost somebody you're grieving you just don't magically make that go away you got to sit in it or if you're going through a time of change you're going to be going to a new job going through a move there's a lot of anxiety and insecurity around that living in the unknown that creates emotions you can't magically make it go away you got to sit in them sitting in those emotions takes a lot out of you if you're in a dangerous place you're there's a war going on you're sitting in intense emotions that you can't magically make disappear if you've got financial problems you can't just make disappear those take a lot out of you the emotions that you have to sit in another important one is when you are supporting somebody who's going through a very painful time you're listening to them you're feeling compassion to them you're spending time with them you're going to be exhausted compassion fatigue is going to be there another one is if you get triggered an old wound an old issue gets triggered you feel disrespected you feel hurt you feel disrespected you feel not heard not seen rejected all of that and you lash out you lose it you just fly off the handle and you go on a rampage in your triggered dysregulated state you're going to be exhausted afterwards it giving in to that trigger and going to your limbic brain and just fueling letting it fuel a whole bunch of behaviors takes a lot of energy another one they're finding is if you are constantly just negative in a negative place in your head criticizing everything being negative about everything complaining about everything in your life it takes a lot of energy it depletes you and part of that is because you're not giving your brain the good chemicals it needs the serotonin the dopamine the oxytocin that it needs to feel good to get energy you're depriving it of that by just focusing on negative all the time and it depletes you if you become involved in a cause a very important cause let's say climate related racial related equality of the sexes related injustice at work whatever if you become a in a cause that is passionate to you it's going to stir up a lot of intense emotions and that can be very draining especially if you then spend time on social media on the internet researching the cause listening to what other people say about the cause it keeps stirring up intense emotions and that can be very draining if you are a perfectionist or if you are a bit of a control freak you just always want to control everything in everybody's life that takes a lot of emotional energy it takes a lot of energy and there's going to be a depletion that can come out of that now let me take this a little bit further in the deeper complex trauma territory most people that come out of complex trauma have what i call a default setting it's where their brain naturally just has become used to and is their normal that could be fear that could be shame that could be feeling guilt all of those just that's the way they've lived all their childhood is feeling those emotions and now that's just their normal their default setting if you have a default setting of shame i'm not good enough my life sucks i'm not valuable i'm not lovable that's going to result in a default setting where you're always seeking validation maybe or approval from others that's draining what i want you to see is certain default settings take a lot of energy some of the other default settings is always worrying about what people think an insecurity what do they think of the what do they think of my hair what do they think of my looks what do they think of how i just performed it takes a lot of energy if you have a false guilt that's always been your default setting you need to feel guilty to feel normal that takes a lot of energy if you've always had an anger and you need to feel angry to feel normal that takes a lot of energy if you've got anxiety or negativity that we talk about that takes a lot of energy if that's your default setting and your brain's just naturally keeps gravitating back to wanting to feel negative and anxious some are always living by should say unrealistic expectations for themselves i should be doing this i should be doing that takes a lot of energy if that's your default setting perfectionism controlling we've talked about if you are a person that your default setting is stuffing emotions that's the first thing you do when you feel an emotion is want to stuff it and be stoic that takes a lot of energy if you have a default setting that doesn't want to feel emotions you just have distractions all the time that takes a lot of energy what i want you to see is when you look at the 60 characteristics of complex trauma that we talk about a lot of those 60 characteristics can become a default setting for people from complex trauma and most of those characteristics if you think about it you realize whoa it takes a lot of energy to have that is my normal it's important to begin to realize that people coming out of complex trauma they have come to a place as their default setting that constantly is depleting important to understand that's just the emotional let's go to the third the pleading category and that's the intellectual what they've realized happens when we enter a bigbrahimani society it becomes our tang is again we have our conscious brain and our subconscious brain our subconscious brain is working 95 of the time we're just in autopilot we're just doing all kinds of different things we're not even aware of that doesn't take tons of energy it's our conscious brain and that's the intense cognitive processing reading thinking analyzing problem solving doing calculations memorizing explaining stuff to people where we ought to be in our conscious brain that takes a lot of energy in fact it takes about a third of our calories our inner conscious brain and if you're in a day where you're just doing a lot of intense thinking processing calculating teaching and you're using a lot of calories and that takes a lot of energy and that's whatent Muchas gracias you're doing a lot of talking you're doing a lot of learning you're doing a lot of Forever and growing and building utibilidad and building confidence and building patience analyzing skills and building awareness and building confidence you're going to be tired afterwards.",

    "text": "Some, they go into a victim mentality when they're depleted. Poor me. My life sucks. They feel sorry for themselves. They tell everybody about how hard their life is, about how tired they are. That's what they think is the solution. And that can actually feed something very, very unhealthy. Some, when they start to feel depleted, they go to avoid procrastinating. That's what their brain thinks is self-care. Just start avoiding everything, procrastinating on everything. Some people, when they're feeling depleted, they go, I'm in a crisis. I'm going to go to a professional and get the professional to magically fix me. That's what they think is the answer to being depleted. Some, when they're depleted, they've learned, I'll just go get my friends to do stuff for me. And they start to use their depletion as a way to get attention and manipulate people to do stuff for them that they should be doing for themselves. And it's only crisis management stuff that's not really taking care of the deep needs properly. Other people, when they're depleted, they're not really taking care of their needs properly. They're not really taking care of their needs properly. They just go, I need to medicate myself. I need help to relax. And they self-medicate. Others, their solution when they're depleted is, people are too much, I just need to isolate and withdraw from people and not connect to anybody because that takes too much energy. All of those might make you feel better for a minute in your limbic brain, but they make the difference. They make things worse in the long run. That's what I want you to see. be aware of your unhealthy self-care tools, your unhealthy patterns for when you're depleted. And most of those have happened at a subconscious level. let's go to healthy self-care. And what I want you to realize that there's two levels of healthy self-care. There's that in the moment when I am depleted and I realize it. What do I need to do now to take care of myself, to get some energy. you're basically kind of in a crisis mode or on the verge of crisis and you're needing to fix some things now. that's one level of self-care. But I hope you're seeing there's a deeper level of self-care.",

Do you realize that you can't love others from an empty cup. if you're not filling your own gas tanks, your own cup, you're never going to be able to love others properly. life is loving others but also to love others I have to love myself. And for many people from complex trauma they have to place their needs on a higher priority than they've been placing them. And that's definitely going to feel wrong but it's important. The next thing is part of self-care and media life is to be able to meet my needs. And self-care is meeting my needs is meeting my needs with things that my needs need. I have to figure out my and dislikes. I have to feel out what feeds my soul, what causes me enjoyment. hobbies, things that I can do that just are fulfilling for me. I need to figure out those things. Self-care has to have self-compassion. I need to think through myself. I need to stay depleted. somebody has said it's the golden rule in reverse.

I want to give them a privilege, position, and blessings. And I'm going to take all of that pain and the work it takes to overcome that pain to build into them a character and a giftedness and a skill set that nobody else could ever have. unless they went through that. And that's the skill set I'm going to need to change the world.

    "text": "And I have had many, many hundreds of people say to me, everybody's got a dysfunctional family. We are dysfunctional. And what goes on in their mind is this distinction that goes, the only other option to dysfunction is perfect. nobody's got a perfect family, we're all dysfunctional. And that seems to make sense. But it really. It really misses an important piece. And that is dysfunctional, the opposite isn't perfect, the opposite is functional. But what does that mean. the word dis for dysfunctional actually means in pain. And what we mean when we say a dysfunctional family, it's a family that's in pain and a family that can't resolve pain. let me broaden that for you. All families go through pain. All families have hard times. All families have bad things that happen. A functional family is able to deal with those things, resolve it, and come out the better for it. there are functional families. to be a functional family doesn't mean you never go through hard times. All families do. What makes it. What makes it a dysfunctional family is it can't resolve that pain. And the members of the family live in unresolved pain, which leads to the piling up of pain. And that is the reality of a dysfunctional family. And what we're going to see as we go into this is that children growing up in pain, they are not going to be able to resolve that pain. They begin to go in their mind, what do I need to do. And they have three different priorities in their mind. What do I need to do is in how I relate that I don't get hurt again. Secondly, what can I do as a kid that will help this family in pain. And thirdly, how do I get my needs met in this family that is in a lot of pain. And that's where the roles come into play. Now over the next couple of weeks, we're going to look at a variety of roles that family members adopt. Children, mom, dad, and there's quite a number. Tonight we're going to look at two, but what I want you to understand up front is that you as a child might have tried several different roles before you found one. And that's where the roles come into play.",

And more stuff gets piled on them all the time. Now, a couple other things are happening with the scapegoat. The scapegoat. Becomes the honest expression of how everybody's really feeling but afraid to show. when he rebels and he gets angry and he lashes out and he speaks his mind to mom and dad, he's really giving a voice to everybody. They won't admit it, but that they're almost thankful for. But then what happens with this scapegoat. Is they're really ostracized by the family. The family says you're the problem and they kind of feel a black sheep. They don't fit. They don't belong in this family because they refuse to play by the rules of this family. And they feel an outsider and outcast. And I suspect all of you have been through some of that. that's as a child. Now let me show you what happens as they get older into adult life. I find it interesting in working with scapegoats or problem child people all the time is that most were extremely sensitive children. That's what clued them in that this family's got problems. Because they got hurt much. And they weren't prepared. They weren't prepared to tolerate it or turn a blind eye. But in order to survive they had to rebel. And in order to rebel they had to harden their heart and harden their skin and shut down their sensitivity. And what begins to happen in a problem child as they get into their teens is they try not to feel anything at all. And they shut everything down. Now that will become problems for them later in life. They will have to relearn how to feel emotions. They will have to really enter into scary territory. that's the first problem. The next one, part of their rebellion in their teens is they started getting applause from other kids for being scared. They started getting applause from other kids for being a bad boy. And they said, wow, here's how I get my validation. I can't be validated in my family because the hero gets all the validation. I will get validation from being a bad boy.",

    "text": "And why that ties in with the Beatitudes is because what David is saying, then David was the writer, and he was a shepherd boy when he was a young man. And as he looked at sheep every day, he thought, boy, there, people are a lot sheep. And what he really meant was, children are a lot sheep. And we said last week that children operate out of the limbic part of their brain, the emotional part. They make decisions based on how they feel or will it make me feel good. Complex trauma, people are children that never grew up emotionally. They're still stuck in the limbic part of their brain. And what David is saying is complex trauma people are very much sheep. And that is what I want to show you tonight. And then that ties in with why said, you need to be broken, you need to be surrendered. That's what sheep have to do. Because sheep cannot survive without a shepherd. Do you realize that sheep is the only animal in the world that cannot survive in the wild by itself. Sheep are their own worst enemy. And if left to themselves, they will promptly destroy themselves. let me help you understand a bit about sheep. And then maybe you'll understand yourself as a child and how you might feel today. number one, sheep can't survive in the wild because they are defenseless. you think about it, sheep don't have sharp claws. They can't fight. They're slow. And with all that wool on them, they're even slower. they can't run for their life. They don't have sharp teeth or fangs. And they're not very strong. they're useless when it comes to protecting themselves. They can't do that. Because of that, sheep are creatures controlled by fear. They are afraid of almost everything. If they're in a new situation, unknown to them, they're afraid. Sound you. Fear of the unknown. Fear of change. If there's conflict in the herd, they're full of fear. And a sheep, if they have any fear at all, they can't lie down and relax and they won't eat. They will just sit there in an anxiety state. And they won't be able to lie down or eat until they feel safe. If they see a predator, then they are full of fear. They can't lie down or eat.",

    "text": "In other words, He helps me deal with my fear that I can relax. Now, let me say this. That, David didn't write this the first day of having as a shepherd. He wrote this at the end of his life. After he had gradually learned to trust and now looking back, I think he's saying, I wish I had trusted Him sooner. I wish it hadn't taken me long because He is a good shepherd. And then it says, He leads me beside quiet waters. That's significant. A sheep's fear is great that it won't drink from a rushing stream. If the water's moving, it freaks the sheep out. It thinks it's dangerous. And it won't drink even though it's super thirsty. what does a shepherd do if he doesn't have a to draw from and put it in a trough. Or if there's not a quiet pond, if there's only a stream, he will take the time to get a bunch of rocks and put them across the stream or halfway across to make a little dam that behind the rocks is a quiet stream and behind the rocks is a quiet little pool of water. And the rushing water can go around the outside but the sheep will then drink because He's created some quiet water. this is a shepherd who knows the sheep intimately. He knows how they click. He knows how they're wired. He knows their fears. He knows what they need. And He takes all of that into account. That's what David's wanting to say about his shepherd. Then it says that He guides me in a righteous path. He is a reliable guide. Then the next one I love. It says He restores my soul. That is super significant. Sheep have a problem. They grow all this wool. And farmers love it and they make clothes from it and it's a great source of income. But what happens before the sheep get sheared is in those final weeks before they get a shave, they got much wool that often when they lay down, if it's on a little bit of a slope, they will flop onto their back because the wool weighs much. And then once they're on their back, it's a turtle. They can't get back on their feet. And the shepherd's term for that is that they are cast down.",

    "text": "if you think of a child in a healthy home who's hungry, who's sad, they cry, they talk, the parents come, they assess what is the need here. Once they figure out the need, they meet that need by giving them food, by giving them a hug, by letting the child talk. The need is resolved and the pain goes away. an unmet need equals pain. In complex trauma, a child has a need, they cry, they express that need, and often they get punished for that expression of need. They get told that they're selfish. But that need is not met. And what does that then mean for the child. An unmet need that is not resolved means that you end up with unresolved pain. You sit in pain that you cannot resolve. And at some point, when you cannot resolve a need that is causing you pain, you then have to make decisions internally. the child says, I don't want to live with this pain from this unresolved need, I will harden myself. I will shut down I don't feel that pain anymore. I will act, try to act I don't need that need to be met. Or I will try to go fight, flight, freeze. I will just avoid. Or I will get angry. Or I will try to get that need met in an unhealthy way. I will adapt. And complex trauma is all about unmet needs. Now this can be really subtle. you can have a child that grows up in a home where it looks all their needs are met, but it could be that all their physical needs are met and some of their emotional needs. But if they have one or two needs that are not met and they've expressed it and asked for help, then they live with an unresolved need that is painful. And that will force them to adapt to survive that unmet need and the pain that it causes. let me give you some examples. And these are all that can come out of complex trauma families. The obvious one is a child doesn't feel safe. And if a child doesn't feel safe, they cry, they run to mom and dad.",

And they don't want to keep feeling that fear they can harden themselves and act they don't care and don't need anybody. Or they can do other adaptations to try and feel safe. This could happen to them. This could happen at a subconscious level. And the solutions that they come up with seem to work at the time but don't work overall. Another one, connection. a child tries to connect. It's a powerful need. It drives them. They reach out to connect and they are met with a wall. They are not able to connect. And that hurts. That feels something's wrong with them. what do they do. They adapt. They try to find a way to not feel that pain anymore. Shut down. Isolate. Don't connect. Say, I don't need people. Or start wearing masks and doing things that will enable me to find a pseudo-connection where I feel I'm connecting but I'm not really risking exposing myself. And then being understood. if a family does not understand a child, and we talked about this last week, that hurts a child. That's a huge need to be understood. And they will try to explain themselves. They will try to present who they are. But if it's still not understood or it's made fun of, then what do they do. Adapt. They go find another group where they find other people them where they are understood. Or they go find a group and they say, I will do whatever I have to do to fit in. And I will wear masks. And I'll let them think they understand me. Huge needs not met. Value, validation, we talk about all the time. If a child's not validated, it's such a huge need, then they will adapt rather than sit in the pain of not being validated. they will find other groups to validate them. They will get validation through different ways that maybe aren't healthy. Feeling loved. If a child doesn't feel that, it hurts crazy. It makes them think something is terribly wrong with them. they have to deal with that unresolved need. what you're seeing is need after need after need.",

Here's my personality. Here's my interests. And if that gets rejected or made fun of, then it hurts crazy. And they realize I cannot be authentic. I must wear masks. I must do other things to be acceptable to this family. But deep down at a subconscious level, they think they've resolved that pain of not being able to be authentic and all those other needs. But it still hurts. And they still have pain at a subconscious level. A child needs to gain more and more control as they get older. If that is not true, then they're not going to be able to live. They're not going to be able to live. They're not going to be able to meet. If they're not allowed to have that, then they get angry. Then they rebel. And now they have this unresolved pain inside of them. The need for control. If a child sets boundaries with parents and siblings and they don't respect those boundaries, then they feel pain. They feel that their wishes don't matter. And what do they do. They adapt. But they still feel pain. And they can isolate. They can get angry and drive everybody away. All of those things are unresolved, unmet needs. Then the truth. If bad stuff is happening, the natural instinct of a child is, I want to talk about it. But what happens if they try to talk about the elephant in the room in the family and they get shut down. And they find out you have to keep secrets around here. Nobody's allowed to talk about it. Nobody's allowed to talk about anything. Or if they do talk about it, they distort it and minimize it and justify it. nobody's giving an accurate picture.

Harden yourself again to all of that pain. that's a lot of unmet needs. And I could keep going. But complex trauma is about needs that aren't met. The child tries to get them met. They get punished. they have to sit in the pain of unresolved needs. Now I want you to understand there's more than just the pain emotion that is happening here that they can't resolve. Because of the unmet need, they have now unmet or unresolved emotions. Pain, but they also have unresolved fear. They can't make their fear go away because of the lack of safety. They have unresolved anger now. They can't fix the situation that caused the anger. now they got anger that's unresolved. Then they're in conflict with family members, but they can't resolve that conflict because nobody will allow them. that's unresolved. They are losing things, but they can't resolve their grief because they aren't allowed to. they have unresolved grief. They have false guilt, failure, unresolved stress. All kinds of painful emotions that they are not able to resolve. Now can you imagine the stress at a subconscious level to have much unresolved pain and unresolved emotions and unresolved needs. That's complex trauma. All of those unresolved things. what I want to do in this series is talk a little bit about healing complex trauma in each of the talks. let me start with this. This is a study that was done by a psychologist named Martin Seligman. And what he did was he did shock stuff on dogs. he put dogs in a cage and when they tried to get out, he would shock them. And after a while, they no longer tried to get out because they knew or their brain said to try to get out equals pain. Because of a shock. , after he had trained them that way, he put with them other dogs who had not been shocked in the same cage. And then he opened the door.",

I started to take it off and stopped because it was pulling all the hairs out of my arm. And she came up to me and said, Just yank it off. And that just froze me because I knew that was going to be a lot of pain. That was going to be very intense. But she said it only lasts for a second then it will go away. And what I find with people going back to the pain is they're afraid to open that wound because they think the initial pain will go on forever. And the reality is it's that bandaid illustration. Yes it's going to hurt initially. But it's not going to last very long as you begin to work through it. And what we're going to propose in all of this is the importance to go deep. But also the importance to handle symptoms today using various techniques. the next thing that I think is foundational is the importance of self-awareness. I have clients all the time who say to me, Give us solutions. Why do we got to look at all this understanding how our trauma affected us and where it came from. let me read you what Bessel van der Kolk's mentor said. People can never get better unless they become aware of what they know and feel. And what he means by that is unless they become aware of what they know and feel at a subconscious level. it's important to understand and brain studies have shown this that complex trauma and living in the survival mode that comes out of that operates below the awareness of the conscious brain. it operates at a subconscious level. And many of you can relate to the fact that you were triggered and you went off and did all kinds of things and you weren't even conscious of what was causing you to act that way. What was going on deep inside of you. And what they are saying is this. You cannot change your behavior unless you take what is operating subconsciously and bring it to a conscious level you're aware of the dynamics of what's happening inside of you.",

    "text": "And that's why I spend much time on self-awareness. Because I know that people can't change behaviors in lasting ways unless they begin to bring the subconscious to the conscious level. And understand what's going on they can see what tools to apply and what needs to be fixed and changed. They can see what is unhealthy, what triggers patterns in their behavior they can change it. self-awareness is critical. Secondly, people need to be able to put words to their story. They have to be able to talk about it. Even though it's painful. It's painful initially. what they have found is trauma, especially for younger children, is intense that it gets locked away and they don't even try to put words to it because they don't have the words at that age to describe it. And it sits down there as this black, dark, painful thing that has no description. And I think one of my roles is helping clients put words to their pain. And what I have seen is as I help them find the word to describe their pain, it's a load comes off for them. Now they can define it. Now they can talk about it and present an accurate picture of it. Now that's not the only solution. It's a part of the big solution. But it is an important part of that solution. Now let me give that to you a little differently. When a child from a healthy home goes through a very painful event, they have parents who help them talk about it, put words to it, put words to their emotions. And then they get comforted, they get tools, they get taught. And it turns into a positive growing experience. That child's memories of that event, as they have resolved it, they will go from painful memories to being harmless memories that kind of fade. But in trauma, when nobody helps the child put words to it or resolve it, they are stuck in the pain. And the memories do not fade. The memories continue. And part of what we're doing is giving people the words and the tools to finally look at that pain that now they can resolve it. I don't take people to pain just because I think, oh, it's good that you go to pain and just sit there.",

And what they did was they took mice and broke them into two groups. And the one group stayed with a very loving family in a very structured, organized world. And the others were put in with very chaotic mice. There was abuse, there was neglect, there was a disaster. I don't quite know how they created that, but that's what happened. And then they let both sets of mice out to go and play for an extended period of time. And then once the mice were all playing, they created these very intrusive, loud, scary noises. And watch what the mice did. Guess what the mice did. They scurried back to mom and dad. And what was significant was this. We could understand that mice from a loving family would scurry back to mom and dad, but the mice that had been abused and neglected by mom and dad, they scurried back to them. They didn't care if it would result in more abuse because their triggers said, go back to who should be your rock. And I've seen that happen in many, many clients, is that they get out on their own, and then they get triggered and they scurry back to people who abuse them. And it points to the need to develop a healthy, loving support network made up of loving people. When people can be heartbreaking and deeply anxious in a situation, then they can set up a measure in which that measure would be based on organic, loving people. And if that's what our community seeks to remember us as, their time of ignoring and renouncing andarius practice is to predict.",

    "text": "And what it means is how does a person get past the other person's natural defenses and guards to get that person to them and then trust them and another way to look at this is grooming is really kind of the ultimate sales person they're going to sell ice to an Eskimo and to do that they got to be really good at convincing this guy they're wonderful and getting this person to believe them and trust them and buy their product that's the grooming stage number one is mirroring and again it's a technical term and it goes this I don't know if you've ever been on a date and you say I really country music and the other person says really I do too wow I love and you go what I'm thinking of becoming vegan and they were really am I and before it they exactly what you they're mirroring back they're listening to what you and then mirroring back to you as if they it that you say we have much in common I think we could have a great relationship meanwhile they go home and have a steak and they listen to hardcore rock music but not when they're with you they're mirroring you the early days in the relationship is they are asking questions to find out what you and they're taking notes that they can present a package to you that you go we have much in common next one love bombing in understanding love languages we have you can show love to a person by saying loving things to them by giving them gifts by making acts of sacrifice for them and they're going to be able to do that and that's for them by doing stuff that is a sacrifice by giving them Focus quality time and giving them lots of physical affection what happens in love bombing is the person he says all the nicest things in the world he gives you gifts he makes all kinds of sacrifices what let me pay for that let me come over in the middle of night and help you and all of that and then when you talk they give you focus they you're the most interesting person in the world and they're going to be able to be the person in the world and they give you lots of physical affection they just bomb you with love and what they are counting on is that you will connect with one of those five and when you connect you're going to go I feel loved and you're going to this is wonderful and your oxytocin is going to start spurting in your brain and you're going to just feel great next one offering lots of emotional support they listen but they don't just listen they listen with I'm there for you I want to be supportive of you feel free to text me and you feel free to call me if you're struggling I'll come rushing over and they listen and they support you and say all kinds of encouraging things then they're very charming they're funny they're cute they are always positive they're very sweet considerate thoughtful all of those things and I can't take my eyes off of them these are things that's what they do and they have got that down to an art now let me just stop and say this if you got your notes there just put a little bracket beside them and say red flags if I see a guy that's this charming and is love bombing me this way red flag they really get to the red flags next the next two become kind of the main red flags number one they rush intimacy they want you to open up about everything they want you to tell them lots and lots of stuff they want to know every detail about your day they are pushing you and pushing you for information I tell clients all the time and teaching them the natural development of healthy relationships from an acquaintance to a very close soulmate type friend you're looking at six year six months to a year what you have in a codependent relationship is one day to six days then what they're doing is they're pushing you for sex and then once they get that then they're pushing you to move in together but they're pushing for an established type relationship they don't stuff to remain in this unknown where they're not sure if you've bought their line yet they are looking to conquer you and get you to say move in I think you're Mr perfect they rush that they pressure that leads to the next one and that is a hyper-sexuality and what I mean by this is they put sex before all other types of intimacy because sex they know creates feelings of intimacy and they know that if they can get you to have sex that you're going to start to feel close to them and then sex becomes basically the glue that brings the relationship together and then if you have a conflict They don't try to resolve the conflict.",

    "text": "They just want sex. And sex is basically saying we've resolved the conflict. See, we love each other again. We don't need to talk about that crap because we just had sex. sex is getting pressured now, not just to bring you together, but to solve the problems in the relationship. And it becomes the glue that holds it together. Sex becomes more and more of a necessity to try to make this relationship work. That is putting way too much pressure on sex. But that is what begins to happen. Now let me present it to you this way. Women will often offer sex in order to get what they feel is love. they go, I'll give you sex, just love me. And guys will often give what looks love in order to get what they feel is love. And they'll say, I'll give you sex. And that can work in a way that you think sex is solving the problems in your relationship and creating a very good, healthy relationship. big red flags when it comes to the whole sex thing. Let me just add one thing. , I've talked to many women and it goes this. I say, let's say you start dating with a guy and a guy is not a narcissist. A guy is not codependent. And he's going to respect you and get to know you properly and slowly and carefully. And he's not going to push you for sex. After two weeks without him pushing for sex, after a month without him pushing for sex, what are you going to start to think. And they go, I'm going to think maybe I'm ugly. Maybe he doesn't me. Because you've been trained that sex should come away to fix your shame. To give you sex. To give you an answer that you have value. And that becomes an issue that you have to work through. that's phase one. that's a bit of a fantasy or an idealized state within the relationship. Now what begins to happen is this guy or this girl are looking to you to solve all their problems. To make them happy and you're not doing it. they are becoming increasingly discontent with you. Increasingly dissatisfied with the relationship. And that's part one.",

    "text": "guess what mr hoover just sucked you back in and the vacuum cleaner worked the dosing is basically to get past the current crisis what they see is you saying we're over breaking up they don't see that at the end it's just we're having a few problems we're in a bit of a crisis here i better change my game for a little bit to get us past the crisis that they want to be with me again now a lot of people who haven't realized that they're with a narcissist they keep believing mr hoover and all of his tricks and they get sucked in again and then they get devalued again and discarded again and then another crisis and he hoovers you again and you get sucked in again and it just goes round and round and round until you finally clue in this is a narcissist this is not some little boy who just needs somebody to love him this is a sick person who is refusing to look at his stuff he changes just to get past the crisis and then he goes back to the other thing which is the real him the masks come off again and that is the normal pattern that takes place rule number one is if you've rejected some a narcissist because they continue to devalue you discard you don't take them back as soon as they hoover you and you take them back you've trained them that their hoovering will work the next time you take them back you're training them that your no doesn't mean no and it's only going to be more difficult the next time and what I tell people this all the time don't say no to a narcissist don't say it's over to a narcissist until you have the backbone to stick to it because if you say no but don't have the backbone and he can hoover you back in you are making it worse for yourself But then, here's what I'd you to take into consideration To this very point we do this in our school or more in our college, ever since life started All young men and women go through this complicated process increase in size, see noque, and fear drunk i'm elusive don't move the line in the sand don't say if you hit me one more time I'm done that's my line in the sand and then they hit you again you say I'll give you one more chance don't do that if they don't respect your boundaries they never will understand that here's what I want you to understand shame works on your limbic brain guess what a codependent relationship is about the limbic brain what is a narcissist about the limbic brain you have to go to your cortex brain and say what are the facts about this guy my limbic brain says I'm still in love he's saying I'm changed I'm changing and he's giving me all these gifts nice things and he's making me feel in love my limbic brain is on fire but let's shut that down what are the facts this guy hasn't respected my boundaries this guy continues to disrespect me this little hoovering thing always gets dropped and he goes back to the ways those are the facts I'm going with facts not with my feelings and that is hard to do but very important to do let me make a couple observations about ending a relationship with a narcissist number one you will probably be replaced quickly and it probably won't be done very nicely you will feel humiliated you're going to have your reputation smeared on Facebook and all kinds of things that is painful but that is what happens don't be surprised by that but what can happen in you is it creates a lot of fear because you've seen the true colors now they may have even threatened you as a way to get you back and you're full of fear because you've seen the real them and be prepared for that but more than just fear the next one thing I want you to be prepared for even more you're going to feel a roller coaster of emotions you're going to miss him you're going to love him and hate him you're going to be afraid of him you're going to want him back you're going to just be all over the map be ready for that and don't act impulsively on any of those things you might go into depression and then the next minute I'm glad I got rid of that jerk all up and down you're going to have a hard time explaining to yourself what was wrong because you don't even know yourself yet they've given you nothing but lies and distortions about what was wrong and your brain's going to spin trying to figure out what was wrong and you might not figure that out for a long time and then you're going to be breaking down and crying one minute full of anger another super irritable missing them and you're going to be why am I a basket case now what's going on here you're going to be confused is part of it and then you're going to feel very misunderstood by friends and family they don't get a narcissist they don't get why you're upset they don't get why you didn't leave sooner all of those things are going to hurt and you're going to feel very much alone then that confusion that we talked about but then you're going to see that you've moved on but you're having trouble moving on and that's going to hurt and that's going to be confusing and then you're going to be your shame is going to go to a new level because you're embarrassed why did I get sucked in by this guy why do I always pick jerks what's wrong with me and that's going to take place and then you're going to get -intentioned people do one of two things just get over it or what he was a really nice guy why don't you give him another chance because they never saw anything except the mass and you're going to get all of that and bottom line is you're going to go through a time where you just don't want to be around people you're not feeling understood you're you're gonna you're embarrassed and you're going to want to isolate and cut yourself off that's dangerous because what you're doing is feeding loneliness feeding too much time in your head and that could set you up to let Mr Hoover take you and suck you back in that is a codependent pattern of relationships last week we talked about what I've been doing is some of the things that we're doing from school things for life we're helping pregnant young women who this type of socializing and which are called puts families kind of addressing child care while their planet's not growing it helps them tell their story and it actually takes them strong along to kind of getting an eye on we talked a little bit about this future development because may be a little bit less than a month.",

I thought he was a loving. And that concept of being in control is very confusing. last week I tried to show you that gave humans a free will. And that's the only way that love is meaningful, is if you do it out of choice, out of free will, and given other possible subjects of that love. gave us free will, but then said, if I'm going to give them free will, I can't intervene. I can't interfere. I have to let them make good decisions as bad, and live with the consequences of that. that is painful to begin to understand, is that we do have free will. has restricted his involvement in the world around us. But then I ended by saying, there's a certain mystery to this. And that is that somehow can still bring good out of bad. And I said I'd tell you a story tonight about that. And it's a story, there's a book in the , about halfway, little before halfway, called the book of Esther. It's a very short book. It's a book about a Jewish girl who was an orphan. We don't know how mom and dad died, but we do know she was an orphan. And she lived with her cousin who was much older than her. he became a surrogate father. Why that was important is because they came out of a battle where their country was conquered. she was taken as a hostage from Israel to modern-day Iran, which was then known as Persia. And her parents might have been killed in the war, but she comes as a girl orphaned into a strange country. As a hostage where she doesn't know the language or the customs. And her life in the early days has a lot of pain. Her uncle or our cousin Mordecai is able to get a good job. And he rises as far as a governmental position. And we're going to kind of look into all of that story. there's four main characters, Esther and Mordecai. And then the king of Iran was a guy named Zerubbabel. And his -hand man was a guy named Haman.",

And then the king said, Esther, what is this about your people. And he says, that edict that Haman got you to sign. He says, I can't unsign it because every edict I make is for good. But I'll make a second edict. And it will encourage people not to fight the Jews and it'll give Jews permission to fight back. And the Jewish people were. Now you see in all of that story, there were thousands of individual decisions made by maniacs, by narcissists, all kinds of things that were happening. There were things that weren't even concerned about Israel happening. A guy having a party and getting rid of his wife because she wouldn't do what he wanted. All of that kind of stuff. There was even more of that. And I think that's what's important. And I think that's what's important. And somehow, and I don't have a clue how, all of those individual out of free will decisions somehow got overturned to bring out a different result. I don't know how does that. But what has said is somehow, and you'll never understand it as long as you're on this earth, I can take something that is very bleak and dark and bring some good. But what has said is somehow, and you'll never understand it as long as you're on this earth, I can take something that is very bleak and dark and bring some good. Let me just end by applying that to Esther. Who did use. He used a young woman with a very painful past. He used a young woman who had been orphaned, abandoned, raised in a foreign country, never felt she fit in. A woman that got all this attention because of her external beauty. People didn't care about her soul, they just cared about her body. She had all kinds of things going on inside of her that were not going to let go of her. There was a minute in her life that I wasn't aware of. And there was a second minute in her life that I knew I wasn't helping her to take that normal look, a external human, also life-changing.",

    "text": "And as soon as something begins to trump love, you can become an abuser. And we all have the potential to be abusive because we all struggle every day with competing desires. And sometimes they do trump love. We get selfish. An abuser is the things that consistently trump love are there all the time. And that becomes the main part of love. And that becomes the main part of their life. Love still pokes out once in a while, but other forces are the more powerful forces in their life. let me give you a couple examples. if a person has this sex drive, it can become a lust thing. If it trumps love, guess what you have. I want my sex drive gratified. I don't care if I hurt you. now you get sexual abuse and rape. That is where the sex drive has trumped love. And then sex then becomes abusive. It becomes using of other people. Second one, greed. We all have this desire. I want money. I want position. And what happens if your desire for money trumps love. I will steal from you. But if it's healthy, I will love will always win over you. I will love you. I will love you. But if it's not healthy, I will have a desire for money. And I will never violate you. I will never use you or steal from you. Same as lust for power. Think of image. If you grew up in a home where image was more important than anything else, when you went out in public, you knew that mom and dad weren't really loving you. That was all fake. But you had to keep an image. And if you didn't maintain the image while you were in public, the image while you were out there in public, you got it when you got home. Because what your parents were saying is, my image is more important than loving you. if you don't maintain my image, I will hurt you. it overpowered love. The same is true with resentments. If we let them take over, they will begin to overpower love. I can have a hurt, be hurt by somebody else, and be angry, but if I'm healthy, I will not ever use my anger in a way to hurt you. Love will win. I will be respectful.",

    "text": "I will work my anger out in a loving way. But if I give in to resentment, I want to hurt you. I don't care about love anymore. Then shame. If you think of being with an abusive person who's got lots of shame, what happens is if you ever, if you ever, expose in public their weakness, or make them look bad, you're going to pay for it. Hiding shame is their highest priority. And you can take comfort, ease, control. If those are your priority that overpowers love, you will end up being abusive. if you get all kinds of those things, then you become even more likely to become abusive. , if anything trumps love, and that thing becomes threatened, I become abusive. that's the underlying forces. part of why I want you to think about this in these terms, is some people's response to people who are abusive is, just stop doing it. As if that's supposed to make them just stop doing it. The reality is, they can't stop doing it till they deal with their shame, and they deal with their shame, until they get those other things that have trumped love, to be under love. And that doesn't happen overnight. dealing with abuse, is not just quitting, it is dealing with deep, deep issues that go back a long way. And for most people, dealing with those issues is a gradual, slow process, but it is absolutely essential. The next thing, that I want you to realize, is the more things that you have in your life, that trump love, the more of a narcissist you are. Because what narcissism says, is my needs, my priorities, trump you every time. And that is again, the subject of these competing priorities, and whether we reign them in, or give them power, because as soon as we give them power, over love, we become a narcissist who abuses. those are two key underlying things, as to why a person becomes an abuser. Second thing, what characterizes an abuser. , how can I spot one. Now, let me just say this up front. I can go through this list, and I believe there's 19 things in this list, and you can know this all in your head, and you can go and fall in love with a jerk, and ignore everything I say.",

Next, they use love as a tool and a weapon. in the beginning in the sales job time, they acted they loved you, but it was just really they were using love to use you. It wasn't a genuine love. Now they can withhold love to get you coming running. They can even say that when they punish you, that's them loving you. they try to make pain equals love or hurt equals love. love gets very distorted and it gets very cruel.",

    "text": "We've kind of covered some of it. Why do people stay. I have had many people come to me with bruises on their face saying I'm never going back. They move out, and guess what. Two weeks later, they're back. And I go, what are the dynamics that cause a person who's got bruises all over to go back for more of the same. two categories here. The first for many, and what I want to say, big picture with this, I will not try to oversimplify this and make it look the person who stays is a failure or I'm shaming them in any way. I've been at this long enough to know that it is not easy to leave. There are all kinds of forces at work, and it's a very complicated, complex issue. I hope I can communicate it in a way that you realize you're not being judged, but you're being understood. number one for many people is there's a huge fear of what the abuser will do if they leave. The safety issue. Will he stalk me. Will he come after me. Will he hurt me. And that is a significant fear. Secondly, there's a lot of guilt. If I leave, they'll fall apart because all they have is me. And I'm afraid if I leave, they're going to go into a huge relapse and they're going to mess up their life. They need me. And there's a lot of guilt that a lot of people have. And the abuser can often say to you, you're the only one I have. You're the only one who gets me. You're the only one that understands me. I can't get sober without you. That sounds great, but that's a lie. They can get sober, and there are other resources that they need to tap into. You cannot be their higher power. That will not work. A big practical thing for many people is the children. How will this affect the kids. Let me just say this. If you stay together with an abuser, you hurt the kids. If you separate from an abuser, you hurt the kids. The kids are hurt both ways. The question is, what hurts them the least. And I would say what hurts your kids the most is you staying.",

    "text": "If you stay in your limbic, you set yourself up, to never leave or to leave and keep coming back. Next thing is the shame. I want to give you a different angle on this. What shame is, is others didn't respect me as a child, now I don't respect myself. if somebody abuses me, I think I probably deserve it, or I think I can't do better than this, but I'm never going to stand up for myself. the point is this. Until you respect yourself, you're not going to require anybody else to respect you. If you don't respect yourself and you don't stand up for yourself, why should anybody else respect you. They're just treating you how you feel about yourself. And you're only going to stand up and say no more to an abuser until you respect yourself. Now let me go back to limbic and cortex. Cortex brain says, I don't feel a lot of positive feelings for myself, but I know I have value, I will stand up for myself even though I still feel unimportant. I will treat myself with respect even though I don't feel it. The limbic brain says, I don't feel respect for myself, I don't respect myself. I never will respect myself because I never feel respect for myself. you've got to switch to the cortex and say, I don't feel respect for myself. I don't feel respect for myself. you've got to switch to the cortex and say, I have value. I'm worth fighting for. I'm worth setting boundaries for. I'm worth getting healthy. And I'm going to start standing up for me. Now that initially will feel selfish. But that is not. That is healthy. That is finally giving yourself the respect that you deserve because of the value inherent in you. The longer you stay in an abusive relationship, the worse your shame gets. The lower your self-esteem gets. , a couple more things. Practical guidelines. What I say to clients all the time is this. Don't leave an abusive relationship till you're ready to stay gone. Until you're ready to enforce it. Don't say, I'm out of here and two weeks later you're back. think through a very careful plan about what you need to do in order to stick to that I'm gone.

    "text": "When you come out of complex trauma, you develop ways of relating to survive. And those kept you safe, the ways you learned to relate. But what you find is as you get older, they don't work anymore. But it's important to go back and really understand your relationship style and why you relate the way you relate. When we talk about complex trauma, one of the terms that I use regularly is a dysfunctional family. And I have had many, many hundreds of people say to me, everybody's got a dysfunctional family, we are dysfunctional. And what goes on in their mind is this distinction that goes, the only other option to dysfunction is perfect. nobody's got a perfect family, we're all dysfunctional. And that seems to make sense, but it really misses an important piece. And that is dysfunctional, the opposite isn't perfect, the opposite is functional. But what does that mean. the word dis for dysfunctional actually means in pain. And what we mean when we say a dysfunctional family, it's a family that's in pain. And a family that can't resolve pain. let me broaden that for you. All families go through pain. All families have hard times. All families have bad things that happen. A functional family is able to deal with those things, resolve it, and come out the better for it. there are functional families. to be a functional family doesn't mean you never go through pain. You never go through hard times. All families do. What makes it a dysfunctional family is it can't resolve that pain. And the members of the family live in unresolved pain, which leads to the piling up of pain. And that is the reality of a dysfunctional family. And what we're going to see as we go into this, is that dysfunctional families are not the same. They're not the same people. They're not the same people. to put it in other words, the child's pain is the same as the one that's going through pain. And a dysfunctional family is the one that's going through pain, not the one that's going through pain. But the problem is that children growing up in pain, they begin to go in their mind, what do I need to do. And they have three different priorities in their mind.",

But what happened is they, in order to maintain that role, had to get sicker and sicker themselves. They don't realize how sick they had to become. And now, when they come into adult life, they're going to still find people who pat them on the back for being a bad boy and pushing the envelope. But if they're going to get healthy and have healthy relationships, they got to be able to let that bad boy go. Now here's a challenge that many have. They go, if I let go of the bad boy, then, who am I. I don't want to become a weak, little, mushy, sensitive person again, that's going to get walked all over and hurt. And to give up a role, either the hero or the problem child, the scapegoat, there's a fear, a fear that if I drop this role, will I get hurt again. Will I get my needs met again. What will happen. And for the scapegoat, the hero, yes, there's fear, but you're never going to get healthy unless you walk through it. And that's what we're about, is helping people walk through that and begin to change that they can have meaningful relationships today. Let me say one final thing about the problem child, the bad boy. I find that, let's say you were a bad girl,. Isn't it interesting how bad girls are attracted to bad boys. And guess what happens in recovery. Bad girls, they're prepared to give up being a bad girl, but for some reason, they're still attracted to bad boys. That's a recipe for disaster. if that is your pattern, you're going to have to look at that piece as.",

But then, when you have a need, and you're aware that you have a need, assess, what is my responsibility when it comes to meeting this need. And you might find out I'm 100 responsible to feed myself. I can't go and ask others to feed me. Or, I, what, I need to be a parent to my children. And I, I'm a single mom. And I'm 90. I gotta be there consistently for my kids. But I need a break sometimes. I need people to help me. I can't 100 meet that need without burning out. I need to begin to look for people who could meet that need.

And they get hurt every time. And the children are getting unhealthy stuff passed on to them. But they don't take the time to build new relationships.

And you have to move out of your comfort zone. But then retrain your conscience. that what you've had before is asking others for help. You feel guilty.

    "text": "welcome back we started a couple weeks ago a study of the life of one of my favorite characters Joseph he's known for saving the world and Israel from this famine that took place many years ago but what I want us to understand is Joseph experienced a tremendous amount of trauma both within his family and outside of his family and last two weeks we've been looking at kind of the unhealthy stuff within his family there was a lot of sick stuff going on there today I want you to see the main traumas that came out of his family and it is quite heartbreaking and many of you will have experienced it but let me start with the very first thing as we read about Joseph it says this in Genesis 37 this is the account of Jacob and his family when Joseph was 17 years old he often tended his father's flocks he worked for his half brothers the sons of his father's wives Bella and zilpa but Joseph reported to his father some of the bad things his brothers were doing the very first word we're given of Joseph saying something he's ratting out his brothers he's telling his dad what they're doing when they're way off in the distance taking care of the sheep and it's some very bad stuff now some people look at this and see Joseph in a negative light he's he's a rat a tattletale but I think the reason we're told this about Joseph is to show that no this isn't a weakness in Joseph this is a strength Joseph from a young boy has a character that says I want what is I want to love people I want to treat people properly with respect and when I see my brothers hurting people doing things that are wrong I want to stop that and we see that from a young boy as a matter of fact he grew up in a family where there's all kinds of sexual perversion where there's all kinds of anger hatred hurting each other Joseph as a young boy says I want to live by love I want to do what is and we see this amazing young man developing who's committed to living by 's design to live by a healthy standard it's a beautiful thing to see but then we get this because of what Joseph did and then a couple other things that we're going to see now Jacob loved Joseph more than any of his other children because Joseph had been born to him in his old age his father favors him over the other children one day Jacob had a special gift made for Joseph a beautiful robe for some of you growing up in Sunday school this was referred to as the coat of many colors we don't know for sure what that the Hebrew word means in referring to this robe but there's basically two things that seem clear by Joseph wearing this robe that his father gave him what Jacob was saying was number one Joseph you don't have to work your brothers you don't have to work as hard number two you're going to get the main part of the inheritance even though you're one of the youngest of the children you're going to get special treatment what happens his brothers hated Joseph because their father loved him more than them they respond out of anger and hatred to Joseph this favorite this pet they couldn't say a single kind word to him Joseph is bullied Joseph is constantly having his brothers take shots at him say hurtful things to him beat him up do other hurtful things to him he is constantly being bullied and put down a very difficult thing for a young boy to grow up in and many of you have grown up in it and then we're told this one night Joseph had a dream and when he told his brothers about it they hated him more than ever what is this dream he says listen to this dream he said we were on the field tying up bundles of grain suddenly my bundle stood up and your bundles all gathered around and bowed low before me in other words Joseph is saying one day you guys are going to bow before me now I think what Joseph is trying to do here is say brothers it's that dad's favoring me because I will someday be over you I will someday rule you someday you will admire me and bow before me out of reverence I think he's trying to help them get over their hatred help them to accept his favored positions but we're told his Brothers hated him all the more respond you think you will be our king do you do you actually think you will reign over us and they hated him all the more because of his dreams and he had a second dream and he told them about it and by the way he talked about them soon Joseph had another dream and again he told his brothers and about it and he listened I had another dream and the sun and the moon and the 11 stars bowed low before me.",

    "text": "Joseph is making things worse when he's trying to make them better. Joseph is feeding into his brother's hatred of him. here's what I want you to think about and many of you can relate to what Joseph went through. He didn't just have one sibling that was bullying him that hated him. He had 10. Older brothers who all hated him who bullied him who beat him up who said every hurtful thing they could say he was bombarded with it day after day 24 7 and then he had three other mothers that didn't him three stepmoms who hated him as who shunned him. Can you imagine. Growing up in that not feeling you belong not feeling love living in constant danger and fear. And then more than that his own mother's dead. He can't go to her for comfort. And if he goes to his dad and his dad comforts him that'll just make his brother's anger worse. And why doesn't his dad stop it. Joseph is hurting big time. And this kid who was a big kid is traumatized in mega ways. You can just again feel the depression the sadness the frustration the hurt the pain all that Joseph went through. here again is a young man growing up with a sick family growing up being severely abused by that family but still saying I want to follow. I want to be healthy. I don't want to adopt the same hatred that my brothers have to me. I want to be free of hatred. I want to have love. And in the weeks ahead we're going to look at what enabled Joseph to be this young man and then it continued and he was that as an adult as. And I just hope it encourages you that I can choose a different way. I can choose a different way. I can choose a different way. I can choose to be healthy. I can heal from all of these wounds that are very similar to Joseph's and I can grow to become a healthy person. Let's.",

    "text": "And what often happens is the parents response when they're exasperated with the bed wetting is they start to shame the child. They start to do things that put the child down. Which feed shame. Which sets a child up for addiction. Because addiction medicates the pain of that shame. Families who are very poor. everybody else at school has new clothes. They're always wearing hand-me-downs. They're always wearing hand-me-downs. They're always wearing hand-me-downs. Worn out clothes. They can't do other stuff. It's subtle. The parents may not control it. But the child is perceiving that even in society I'm not good enough. I don't make the mark. Children coming from a different ethnic culture. Who then come into a Canadian culture and they don't fit in. They don't feel understood. They're teased a little bit. That can send all of that. Or back in the day where there were big families. Parents love those kids to death. They just had no time for them because they were worn out from taking care of all the others. the child felt neglected they didn't matter. those are a whole bunch of things that can send the shame message. Self-awareness. Begin to understand what triggers those shame beliefs and feelings. what triggers you to feel shame. Or to start thinking shame lies. Or to start beating yourself up. Understand those triggers. self-awareness. And then understand once you're triggered. How do you behave. How does it affect you. How does it affect your actions. How does it affect your thinking. How does it affect other emotions. As you begin to understand your triggers and your patterns. What's going to happen is the next time you're triggered.",

    "text": "That just gives me the extra motivation to go and deal with this and reach out for help. I want it to be a message of motivation, but a message of hope. That there is help for people who have gone through this. just as again an introduction to understand sex. I talked about it's designed to be kind of the most beautiful thing within a committed relationship to just add beauty to that relationship. it's not the sex that makes the relationship beautiful, it's the commitment of two people who are safe, who are authentic, who are willing to help each other. Who are truly connected at a spiritual, intellectual, emotional level. And then the sex is just the cherry on top. It just adds extra beauty and connection. But understand then that there's other types of sex. the first is that soul intimacy sex. That's the ideal. That's the healthiest form of sex. But then there's a second form of sex. And what about a person who's not in a committed relationship. Who's single. They still have a sex drive. They still have testosterone and estrogen being released in their system. That's creating a desire for sex. And for them I have what I call the sex that is just the release of sexual pressure that's building up. And for some people that can be masturbation. Just to kind of release that pressure. For others that can be friends with benefits or a fuck buddy that just releases that pressure. But that is not as satisfying as the first type. But it's a release of sexual pressure. And then the third type is addiction sex. it's the person that compulsively is engaged in sex where there's not intimacy. There's not safety. It's just it goes beyond just a release of sexual pressure. It is something that they can't break. It's almost an animal sex that satisfies temporarily physically but it doesn't satisfy emotionally. It doesn't satisfy spiritually. And it becomes a prison to them. It becomes something that takes them away. It takes them into greater pain, greater emptiness. Now the problem for people with complex trauma is most have never experienced true connection, unconditional love, authenticity. they've never experienced type A. That beautiful intimate sex. all that they've been left with is kind of other forms of sex that aren't as satisfying.",

    "text": "And of the perpetrators, 75 of the perpetrators were themselves sexually abused as children. those are just sad to look at those statistics, especially when you come to look at them within the world of complex trauma and addiction. I want to go to really as early as I can in this talk to what would I say to a person who's been sexually abused as a child. And I want you to know that I have dealt with hundreds, thousands of people who've been sexually abused. Sadly, it is just way too common in my world that I work in. And I've learned that people who've been sexually abused often have trouble dealing with it because they feel guilty. And the first thing I want people who are sexually abused as children to understand is it was not your fault. Whenever you have somebody in a position of power and a child who's not in a position of power, the fault is always on the person in the position of power because they were able to make the choices. And they took advantage of you. And now, people still struggle. And what I want you to understand is the guilt that you feel is actually false guilt. You were made to feel guilty even though you weren't guilty. And part of your journey is figuring out that all this guilt you feel is actually false guilt. It was put on you by somebody else, and they have the authority to take the guilt off themselves because they are actually the guilty person. And where does the false guilt potentially come from. , the person who sexually abused you may have blamed you. They may have said, you must have wanted it because of the way you dressed. it's your fault. Or you must have wanted it because of how you talked or looked at them. No, you're an innocent child. All the fault is with them. But then, you might feel guilty because part of you enjoyed the intention that you got from them. They gave you special attention. They treated you in a special way. They gave you gifts. They gave you things. And you that. And now you feel maybe, I was wanting the sex because I liked all that attention.",

    "text": "No, you were just learning and trying to be kind, which is built into all of us. Genuine love. They took advantage of that love. And the reason you liked the attention often was because you weren't getting the proper kind of attention you should have been getting from the other people in your life. that is not an area where you have failed. But then some people say, but I feel guilty I must have wanted it because it gave me some pleasure. I liked it, but I didn't it. I didn't part of how it made me feel, but I liked some of how it made me feel. there's an ambivalence inside of you. What I want you to understand is the pleasure part wasn't something that you created by wanting it. It's just the way your body works. That when you stimulate certain parts, there's a pleasure experience. That doesn't mean you wanted it. That means your body was just functioning the way it was designed to function. you shouldn't feel guilt for that. There's another piece around this that's connected to the guilt. And it's important to understand. Usually in childhood sexual abuse, the child is told not to say anything. They are told to carry this secret. That is a terrible burden for a child to carry. Because they're told, you're going to have to carry this secret. Because when you carry a secret, you're made to, you have an internal sense that you're being asked to protect that something is wrong. And what the perpetrator may have done to get you to carry that secret is he may have threatened you that if you don't carry that secret, he'll hurt you or hurt somebody you love. Or if you reveal that secret, you're going to ruin your dad's reputation. You're going to ruin your family. Or nobody will believe you anyways. And you carry this secret and it's a burden. It creates a shame inside of you. The truth is, you are not carrying the secret to protect yourself or your family. You're carrying the secret to protect the perpetrator. Because the perpetrator does not want to have his behavior revealed. But what I want you to understand is that to the sexual abuse, now another weight is being added and that is being threatened. Carrying a secret.",

    "text": ", if men want me because of sex and they have lots of shame where they naturally don't themselves or feel very valuable, then they go, I'll be flirtatious. I'll be good and bad. Because that gets me attention and that makes me feel good. Or for others, what they realize is if they're very sexual and good at that, it gives them power over the other person. The other person is putty in their hands and they that feeling of power. And for them, sex is power. Others can go to the very extreme where now sex is all they think about. Everything is sexualized. Whatever anybody says, it just brings up sexual connotations. Every person they meet, they undress them in their mind. They see them sexualized. Sex just takes over their life. Another thing that can happen for some people is that they develop a distorted view of the opposite sex. if you're sexually abused by a man and you're a woman, sometimes it's very easy to begin to think that all men are dirty, that all men want is sex. And if you've been sexually abused by several different men, it's very easy to begin to think that way. And that can cause you problems in adult life or in a marriage because what happens is you love and hate men at the same time. And that gets in the way of true healthy intimacy. But there's a third distortion that can come out of sexual abuse and that's a distorted view of yourself. you begin to see yourself as dirty, as used good. It has a lot of shame for you. And you go, who would ever want me. I'm used goods. I'm dirty. Or for some, sex is what made you feel you had value, your body. People wanted your body. And sex for you is what gave you value, made you feel worthwhile. And you see yourself primarily as a sexual being. You don't see yourself accurately. You don't see yourself as having value outside of sex. It's all tied up with sex, which is a distorted view of self. And that has tragic consequences. And then another one for many people is trust issues.",

Or you had a parent who was sick or depressed and they couldn't take care of you and you felt a burden to them. Or you had a workaholic parent who was always stressed out all the time and became exasperated whenever some new situation came up. And that included if you were to ask for anything. Or you had a parent who was focused on looking good, their image, that negative emotions a child crying, a child being afraid, a child having a need and expressing it was perceived as weakness. It made them look bad as a parent that they weren't doing their job. they shamed you and made you feel guilty for crying or showing fear. Or you had a parent who was great with all the other kids in the neighborhood and was always spending time doing fun stuff with them but didn't seem to have time for you. Or you had a parent who parentified you, who relied on you for emotional support instead of relying on their spouse. And now you can't have a problem or you have to rely on them. Or when you asked a parent for something, they made it all about them. They then went, don't how busy I am.",

    "text": "Now, it's been important in the research to begin to understand that people go through two times in their life, two periods in their life, where there's major development. And then there's the second period, which is the period of development in the sexual area, which then affects the rest of themselves. four to six-year-old is that kind of the first period where a child is in the discovery of their body. And they're exploring their body. It's just innocent. They're finding out they have a penis, a vagina, all of those things. They're finding out that girls are different than guys. They play doctor. All of those things are there. What I want you to see is to that four to six-year-old. Love is non-sexual. Love is just love. It has no sexual connotations for them. But if a child at four to six in this exploration stage is shamed for exploring, it does tremendous damage. If they are abused sexually at this stage, it can do tremendous damage. this is a very vulnerable stage. The second. The third. The fourth. The sixth. The seventh. The second one is puberty and it's even more vulnerable. the sex drive is awakening, the body is changing, sexual attraction is developing and all of a sudden there's pubic hair, there's growth, development and they become self-conscious. They're extremely vulnerable at this time to being laughed at, to comparing themselves to others. Their whole identity becomes wrapped up in their sexuality. It's an extremely vulnerable time. with that as a background, let's move into what then happens to a child who goes through some way that behavior in their parents and their home that affects them sexually. neglect, abuse, parents that overreact, bad teaching. the first thing that can happen from sexual abuse, from neglect. Is they go to hypersexual drive or no sexual drive. the hypersexual drive, sexual abuse in that four to six year old age, that exploration stage. What can happen when you awake a drive too early is it becomes a hyper drive. And now the child can't get enough sex. Sex becomes a big part of everything that gives them pleasure, that lets them escape, that they want more. More of to get more and more pleasure. it becomes a hyper drive.",

Shame. I don't feel good enough. I don't feel lovable. But all of a sudden, somebody wants sex with me. I feel lovable. Oh, that just solved my shame issue. sex is now the solution to my shame.",

And then by doing that, it's connecting with the child. remember that because we're going to come back to it. then what you have to understand is that when the parent does this for the child, meets the need, connects, soothes, the parent has to be regulated themselves. They have to be in a calm state that the baby, when it connects, it's connecting to calmness. That helps regulate the baby. And what you see then, is the parent is providing external regulation for the baby. But as it does that, the child gradually learns how to regulate itself. It learns the tools, the ingredients of being able to regulate itself when it feels dysregulated. It can meet needs, it can connect with people, it has proper soothing type of things. what you can understand then, or two possible things can happen. The baby's not regulated, it cries. What happens if nobody comes. Then it gets more dysregulated. It cries even more. Or option two, what happens if a parent comes but the parent is not regulated. They're frustrated, they're angry, they're impatient. The child connects and is same-sex on the other side, and the baby is able to come back to its normal state. next to the parent but picks up their mood, their dysregulation, and that dysregulates them even more. And there's different kind of options or things that can happen as far as the response to the baby. And if those two things happen, then the baby is not learning tools to regulate itself. It is finding that being dysregulated only leads to greater dysregulation, because nobody cares enough to come or everybody sees them as a burden and is annoyed with them, and that leads to greater dysregulation. let me take that and give you kind of four components then that help regulate. number one is rhythm. Dr. Perry refers to studies that have been done, and it goes this. what happens when a baby is in the womb, what it hears is the mother's heartbeat, 60 to 80 beats a minute. But it doesn't just hear the mother's heartbeat, that heartbeat causes vibrations in the amniotic fluid, which is pressure changes.",

They're too little to flee. there's no point in having cortisol. There's no point in having oxytocin because nobody cares. what the brain does. The brain then does is prepare itself to freeze. And what that means is the brain prepares itself to get hurt. And this is interesting to understand. Because if a child can't fight or flight, it must freeze. The brain then releases opioids, its own opioids in the system to prepare it to get hurt. the brain then does. It does that to prepare itself to get hurt. it won't feel it badly. But also what happens is the brain slows the heartbeat down. In fight or flight, cortisol sped the heartbeat up. But now on freeze, it slows it down, preparing it to get hurt. The child retreats into itself. It doesn't flee outwardly. It flees inwardly. Into its own fantasy. And the child goes to people pleasing. I'll do whatever you want. Just don't be angry. Don't hurt me. And that happens because of complex trauma. the only way then to regulate the emotions if it can't fight or flight and resolve it is let's release opioids to calm the child down. Let's dissociate. That'll regulate the child. Let's people please. That'll regulate the situation. it's still about regulation. what happens when they get to adult life and there's still nobody in their life that cares that's helping them and they're dysregulated. They need to release opioids in their body. And people will bang their heads against the wall. They will cut. That will release opioids in their body. They will burn themselves and that brings back the regulating feelings again. Or they find drugs and alcohol. They find opioid chemicals out there. And those help them feel regulated again. complex trauma sets people up for cutting, burning their own opioid system, for drugs, synthetic opioid systems. All to help them regulate. let's move on to healing. There's some very important healing phases. And we've talked about this in other talks in a lot of detail. But let me just quickly go through some of the phases.",

    "text": "normally in a healthy fear situation, you experience fear because you're in danger. You go to fight or flight. You resolve the problem. The fear goes away. In complex trauma, the child can't go to fight or flight. The child can't resolve the fear. The fear does not go away. they live in constant fear. Fear now is not a good thing. Fear becomes a negative force in their life. It no longer takes them and pulls them in a direction that is going to rescue them. It begins to take them and pull them in directions that actually hurt them and hurt others. And result in maladaptations that are very harmful in the long run. And when a child can't resolve fear, the child does not want to live with this constant emotional fear. Who wants to live with this very negative, intense emotion that's terrifying. the brain then goes to new approaches to try and deal with the fear. It can't resolve it. what then can it do. a bunch of different options begin to come to the surface that many people in complex trauma try all of the options and then settle on one or two of them. some totally repress their fear. They just harden themselves. They try to act they have no fear. And they will even go to, they will engage in risky behavior to prove to others that they're not afraid. They will not be afraid of anything. The problem is that even though you repress fear, you move it from the conscious level but you put it to the subconscious level. And your subconscious brain is the biggest part of your brain. It's the part that controls you the most. And the fear is still controlling you. The second option that the brain goes to is to dissociate from fear. To disconnect from your fear. To dissociate from your emotions. some, there's different ways that you dissociate. Some, they would escape to a fantasy world. in this world, they don't feel helpless. They don't feel afraid. They don't feel hopeless. They feel powerful. They feel they're Superman. They wear a cape. In this world, there might be no danger or there is danger but it never bothers them because they can handle everything. they're always safe and secure. Now I need to make a note here.",

And the belief is that once they get healthy, they'll be a Superman. Once they get healthy, they'll never experience fear. Fear will not exist in their life. They will be competent to handle every situation. And that is actually a lie. But it comes very naturally and easily out of somebody who's developed a fantasy world in complex trauma to deal with fear. There's a third thing the brain can do. And that is develop numbing activities. Let's engage in activities that numb me out. That just cause me not to feel. And that can be eating. That can be eating to medicate emotions. That can be all kinds of just let's go to zombie land through an activity. Then another thing is let's engage in activities that just keep us too busy to feel emotions. if I'm distracted by constant activity and busyness, then I won't feel my fear. let's be a workaholic. Let's constantly be doing something. We can't sit quietly. We can't sit quietly. Because then we would feel fear. Then another one is let's find things that medicate our fear. some people find drugs and alcohol, sex, other activities that just medicate fear. And the brain is again looking for ways to try and not feel the emotion of fear. There's a third thing that the brain does. When it can't resolve fear and it doesn't know how to get rid of fear, it then becomes hypervigilant. if I'm constantly on alert, I'm hypervigilant, then I will spot danger. And maybe the more I can spot danger, then I will have less fear because I will be able to be proactive to prevent being in dangerous situations. What can happen though with that. Is that they're constantly focusing on the negative. Every time they're in change or in an unknown situation, they then go, oh, oh, something bad is going to happen. I need to just focus on negative. Then they start to obsess on negative. Then they start to anticipate fears. They begin to read danger into situations where there isn't danger because they just want to be prepared for everything. let's read in danger even though it's dangerous.",

Or you're around friends and they're giving all the attention to one of the friends but they're kind of ignoring you. And you feel outside for that encounter with your friends.

You can see easily that some of those triggers are gonna be a lot more intense than others. Some are gonna take you from 0 to 100 in a nanosecond. Some are just gonna mildly annoy you. But there's a greater degree of intensity depending on the trigger and depending on who it is that triggers you. you need to factor that in. The next thing that is important is the intense triggers, they send you in a negative direction in a nanosecond. we often talk about when anger is triggered, you go to 0 to 100 in a nanosecond. Shame can be the same way. And you, can almost find it impossible to catch yourself from going to certain places in your thinking and certain behaviors. And we're gonna get to those in a minute. But I want you to understand the pull, the powerful pull that shame can have when it is triggered in an intense way. I talked about how often it is triggered. The next thing I say to clients is this.

And then Moses had an older sister who was eight years old named Miriam and she hung around there all day to make sure nobody stole it and make sure it didn't float away or a crocodile didn't get it. And for several months this baby got put in the little basket every day and was hidden in the Nile River. Can you imagine how stressful that would be. Every day the mom and the dad are worrying are we going to is somebody going to find the baby today and report it and it will get killed. Will we get punished if it gets found and reported. Will they punish all the slaves are we doing something stupid here. But no we think 's told us to do this. they are just going through all of this. One day Pharaoh's daughter decides to have her bath in that part of the Nile River. And as she's bathing she hears a baby crying and she sends her servants to find out where's that baby crying coming from. And they look around and they narrow it down and finally they find this little basket and they bring it over to the daughter of Pharaoh and they open it up and they know that it's a baby Jew because it's been circumcised. And they go this is a Jewish baby. Now the daughter of Pharaoh knows she should have it killed but she falls in love with this little critter. And she says I want this baby. Miriam at that moment comes out and she acts oh what did you find. We found a baby and we need somebody to nurse it. And Miriam goes I know somebody that could nurse this baby. And the daughter of Pharaoh says please go find it. Miriam goes and gets her mom, Moses' mom and brings her along and says this lady could take care of this baby.

You want to know what's going to happen after a while of doing that. You start doing in recovery, and you go, don't get your hopes up. This will hurt if you blow it again. what, let's just relapse now and get it over with. And what happens for many people coming out of trauma is they desperately long for hope, but their hope's been dashed often they're afraid to hope. And it's a huge dilemma that sets you up for a lot of sabotaging. , the next thing that happens when you come out of trauma is that you are attracted or drawn to chaos and to risky behaviors. That's just kind of epidemic. And what people who don't understand it, they say, if they grew up in chaos, and they grew up in all kinds of pain, why now, when they're trying to stay safe, do they put themselves in chaos and in risky behaviors. That just doesn't make sense. They're going to get hurt. I don't know if you've ever thought about it. But I want to give you kind of three reasons why that happens. If you think of relationships in dysfunction, unhealthy homes, they are great highs, great lows, or bad lows. But it's an extreme swing. Things are going great, great make-up sex, everybody's on a honeymoon, then it crashes, life sucks, everything sucks, and it's straight. , what's going to happen if you get into a healthy relationship where the ups and downs are this. You go, this doesn't feel. Something's missing here. And something in you is drawn back to chaos because it feels normal. That's what you're used to. It kind of feels you're in a normal family again. And there's that attraction. But the second thing, when you're in trauma, and you have fight, flight, and that's not the option, you freeze, and you stuff all your emotions down, and you say, I can't feel because that's pain and that hurts, and you stuff everything away, what happens from that, which you're not prepared for, is that life becomes dead.",

You don't go, the reason life is boring is because I'm a victim of trauma and I've stuffed my emotions. You don't go there. You go, what I need is a little bit of excitement. And people that come out of trauma who've stuffed all their emotions end up needing risky stuff in order to create some feelings because that's how dead they are. And then the next one is, for many people that are dealing with trauma, they've got all kinds of painful emotions happening down there, and their brain is saying, we're not going to run away totally, but we need something to medicate these emotions. We're not going to go to drugs or alcohol. Let's just introduce chaos. Because if I'm feeling chaos and all of the emotions of chaos, I won't feel this pain. And that's another reason. , if you've got six out of six far, you're probably, you feel at home with everybody else that's here. Next thing that comes out of trauma is trust issues. what happens in trauma is the two people in my life that I should be able to rely totally on, mom and dad, aren't meeting my needs consistently. They can't be relied on to do that. And they're doing things that would hurt me. And there's trust issues that are happening. And the conclusion is the only person I can depend on to meet my needs is myself. And I can't trust them. I can't trust anybody else. If you trust anybody else, you get hurt. And what then happens, because you don't trust anybody else, is that you cut yourself off from all kinds of help. If I give you this illustration, if you were a little child and you were on a roof, and dad was on the ground and he said, jump, I'll catch you. And you jump and he doesn't catch you. You're hurt. You're angry. And dad says, get back up on the roof. Jump again, I'll catch you this time. you're a little kid. You get back up on the roof. You jump again, he doesn't catch you.

Some even have experienced where their anger, they quickly go to a black rage. And what I mean by that is they're not, it's almost they lose consciousness of what is happening. They just get consumed by their anger that later they don't even remember what they did. It's they have a blackout regarding what happens in those moments. And that's a scary thing for them because they don't know what they did or who they hurt. It's important to understand up front that anger is probably one of the most intense emotions. And it creates this powerful pull to act in certain ways. What is important to understand, again, up front is that anger was initially designed to pull us in a positive direction. And I'll explain that in a little bit. What happens in complex trauma, what I'll explain in another video is that gets messed up, and now anger pulls us in a negative direction, in a harmful direction, and to stop that pull is hard because anger, part of what makes it intense is cortisol is released to help you fight. And now it's a turbo charged emotion that's got extra chemicals behind it. Ii means a physical force that's relieving that thought and a mechanical force try to control that is even more difficult. Some find that anger becomes their default setting. They become addicted to anger. They need to have anger, feel anger every day to feel normal, to feel alive, to feel energy. And that's a dangerous place for them. they don't need something to trigger them to become angry. They can get themselves angry every morning. They purposely try to get themselves angry because that gives them the energy to get going in the day.

And I call it the lava in the volcano. most people with complex trauma have this simmering lava that has been there for as long as they can remember.

And anger motivates you to try to push the relationship back to healthy. what happens when a relationship, when something violates love, is it steps outside of that boundary of healthy. And anger is saying, no, we got to get back inside healthy boundaries. We got to be respectful. We got to be honest. We got to be faithful to each other. We got to respect each other. anger provides the motivation and the energy to try to get something back to a healthy state. And the brain releases cortisol to help do that. Secondly, if a person is in danger and they don't have the tools to resolve it, then anger, the cortisol gives them extra energy to fight or flight, to get out of danger. anger has two very, very good purposes in protecting a child and keeping stuff loving.

And then what happens with people is as soon as I feel embarrassment, let's switch it to anger quickly. anger becomes a secondary emotion. as soon as I feel anxiety, embarrassment, shame, fear, let's turn it to anger. And they can do that within a nanosecond. they don't even know anymore what the real emotion is. All they know is I'm feeling anger. Another tool that many children used anger for was to create boundaries. they tried to say no to people. People didn't respect their boundary.",

    "text": "And they had only two options left. They could isolate from people and create a boundary. Geographically, they could isolate from people and create a boundary. Or they could blow up and use anger to drive people away. The problem with that is when they blow up and drive people away, usually they feel guilty afterwards. And then they let everybody back in until they feel overwhelmed again. And then they drive them away. anger became part of setting boundaries. Then another thing is they're getting hurt all the time. What they found is when they use their anger in sneaky ways, they're getting hurt all the time. And they learned to use anger in sneaky ways, they can hurt others. anger is a great tool to hurt people. anger now is not about protecting love. Anger is now a tool to hurt people. Then others find, I anger because that cortisol's release, which releases adrenaline, it gives me energy. And if I'm feeling tired, if I'm feeling run down, anger gives me the energy to be productive, to get through the day. Others, anger can be a great tool for protecting people. And anger becomes a bit of a shield, a radar system, a protective guard. the fear is when you live in danger, if I drop my guard, something bad will happen that I didn't see coming. What children learn is if I stay angry, I stay on guard. I don't drop my guard when I'm angry. let's stay angry because then I'll never drop my guard. I'll never get hurt. Then what people find is when they're angry, their natural response is two things. They become self-righteous. They always feel and that feels good. Secondly, they always blame somebody else for their anger. It's their fault that I'm angry. And it gets the attention off of me. It gets the focus on others. It keeps me from having to look at myself honestly, I've always got somebody else to blame. anger is an important tool in denying the real issues and feeling good about myself instead of guilt and shame. I hope what you begin to realize is children coming out of complex trauma, they started with the use of anger. That got shut down. Then they developed all of these unhealthy uses of anger. recovery is going to require a lot of self-reliance.",

Or anytime somebody is unhappy, somebody's in a painful emotion, somebody fails, somehow the child is made to feel it's their fault. They should have done something more. They should have helped more. They should have fixed the problem for the person. The fact that the person's unhappy must be my fault. The fact that the person failed and is struggling must be my fault. Or some children have done something wrong. They should have done something wrong. They should have done something wrong. They should have done something wrong. They should have done something wrong. They should have done something wrong. They should have done something wrong. Kids grew up with parents who were poor. And what the parents often said to the kids is, it's because you kids were poor. Because you cost much. now the kids are feeling guilty all the time that they live in a poor family. Or the child has, their needs are not being met. They're not connecting. They're not being nurtured. They're not being validated. And they go and they try to get those needs met. And their parents say, you're being selfish. now they feel guilty for having a need. That's false guilt. Or they are tired. They know they need to rest. They know they need to do some self-care. They know they need to relax. But as soon as they rest and relax, their parents say, you're lazy. You're selfish. Get to work. now they feel guilty for actually taking care of themselves in a healthy way. all of those things, the parents have been mistraining the child's conscience. they feel guilt when they're actually doing healthy stuff. And that is very common. let me expand on that with the next one. an unmet need in the other person. In complex trauma families, often the child is made to feel responsible for what is happening in another person. let me give you an example. Let's say that dad is beating up mom. The child is made to feel, because of all the trauma, that the child is being beaten up by mom. And the child is being beaten up by mom.",

That's been their default setting. They're normal. They don't even realize when they're at three, four and five, because that's all just in their subconscious. They just live with that all the time. And the problem is, is that when they're getting to five, six, seven, it's not yet on the radar. It's not yet in the red.

Anytime you go through change or transitions, anytime there's a disruption in your daily routine, that adds stress to your system. When you get memories of past events that were painful, that adds stress to your system. be aware of that. Then be aware of the early warning signs that stress is affecting you. physical warning signs. You might start having trouble sleeping or you might just want to sleep all the time.

People with fear of abandonment who conclude that everybody's going to abandon them actually can drive people away. They create abandonment scenarios. They push people to abandon them. they get super needy, super clingy, super demanding. They smother people not wanting to be abandoned.

Because that will then fit their script that everybody's going to abandon me. But then there's another piece to this that happens with those who have been abandoned. They haven't connected with anybody as a child. Anytime they tried to connect, they got hurt. they concluded connection was a bad thing. But more than that, they never got any healthy tools to connect. And now when they come into a relationship, they're afraid to connect. If I connect, I'm going to get hurt. I will try to have pseudo intimacy in a relationship. But the other person goes, no, we need to connect to have a healthy relationship. And the other person keeps trying to connect. But the person who's been abandoned just remains emotionally available. They just remain pseudo intimacy only. And the other person gets tired of trying to connect and not being able to connect. And abandonment gets created. Another thing that happens for people who have been abandoned is they develop unhealthy expectations about what not being abandoned looks. they actually, they come into relationships with all these expectations that you have to do this if you're not going to abandon me. And they set up abandonment again. one of the things is, and this can be very subtle, a very subconscious thing. They might not even say it, but it's there. You must only love me. If you have any other friends, if you're close to your family, that means you don't love me. That means you're going to abandon me. You must never have a flaw. You must never fail me once. If I can find a flaw in you, if you fail me once, then you're going to abandon me. I am going to be looking for flaws. I am going to be giving you careful scrutiny. And what happens is for people who have been abandoned, they will create flaws. Just say, not a safe person. Nope, they're going to abandon me. You must give me constant validation. If you don't constantly praise me, validate me, delight in me, then that means you don't find me attractive. That means you are going to abandon me. You must never set boundaries with me.",

And then when you get to adult life, they end up causing you to be wounded, the other person to be wounded, and they do not work at all. that's what we're going to look at. But let me back up and just give you a little bit of background on this term connection or the technical term is attachment. what do we mean when we talk about connecting or attaching in a healthy way. What I do in thinking about this is what would it be if a child felt sick, safe, that they could drop all their guards, all their masks, all the walls around their heart, they would be able to be able to be emotionally connected to somebody who was emotionally available. Also with that, they would need to have their needs met in order to feel that safety, in order to be able to drop their guard. they would need to feel totally accepted. They would need to feel totally accepted. They would need to feel totally accepted. They would need to feel unconditional love. They would need to feel respected. They would need a relationship that was consistent for them and that was fair and there was honesty. Then they could be authentic. what I've said in the past is this. Children do not lie because they decide it's a good idea. They lie to survive. Children want to be authentic, but in an unsafe environment, they can't survive. They can't survive. They can't survive. They can't survive. They can't be authentic because if you're authentic, you get hurt. And they learn to not be authentic. And the question of connection is, you can't connect in a healthy way unless you live in a safe environment where you can be totally authentic. And I think what you can see up front is that children raised in complex trauma cannot form that connection. Not because they don't want to. But because it's not safe to be authentic. And that's what we're talking about. if I take that a little bit further, children need that connection all the time, but they need it most when they're feeling afraid or when they see danger or when they're feeling unsettled or uncomfortable.",

And again, a child isn't able to form a consistent healthy relationship. And they need to be authentic. And they need to be authentic. And they need to be saliva-cream-only, who 있고 I don't know. but the more than that, they can start a barter of information compacted. Ugh, you water drift. it's really, really close. I'm kind of execute the process before one tire but I am more than happy to hire them at the hospital. The second half. What about now. realize, no, I want connection. And as far back as you can think or remember, you can remembering wanting to feel part of, wanting to belong, wanting to feel a connection with somebody. it is built into us. What is fascinating to me is this. When you look at the effects of drugs and alcohol, do you want to know what emotions they create inside of a person. The emotions of connection. And what happens inside of a person is if they can't connect to a person, they will connect with something. And that will be either an activity or a chemical. Because both of them will give them the feelings of connection without the risk of healthy connection. Now, if you're going to make it in recovery, you can no longer be connecting to a chemical because that no longer works. You have to begin to learn how to connect with safe people in a healthy way. And that's where we're going to get into at the end of our talk tonight. Next thing I want you to think about is the value of connection in times of danger. what happens to a child in a healthy home when they get upset. the term we use is their emotions become dysregulated. they don't regulate their own emotions because they're panicking. They're afraid and they're starting to freak out and all of that and crying and they run to mom or dad.",

    "text": "How does trauma cause people to confuse validation with love. And how do they shift from needing approval to self affirmation. Two wonderful questions. Where I would start with that, Lisa, would be to me, validation and love are two core needs that every child has. But what happens within complex trauma is a child quickly begins to realize they have to earn love. Love isn't just given, they have to somehow earn it by adapting certain ways to conform to the rules, etc. there's not unconditional love, it's conditional love. But then that what they get if they conform is they get validation. And that feels love, it feels , oh, I'm getting recognized, I'm getting a sense of value, I'm appreciated, I'm respected, but they're not seeing it still conditional, it's only if I conform, now I have to perform in order to get validation, which now is starting to get twisted in their mind. That's what love feels. if I get validation, then I feel I'm being loved. it's kind of narrowing what love is to validation. But then it's all dependent on I have to perform. And it's all dependent on others must give it to me if I perform. Because what's happening when initially when a child isn't getting the love unconditionally, and they realize they have to earn love, is they are beginning to believe that something's wrong with me just the way I am. I'm not worthy of love the way I am being authentic. I don't me, I can't validate me because I must not be good enough. they stop self validation and replace it with criticism. they develop a strong internal critic that's always finding fault as to why they're not getting love because you did this because you're not good enough here because you're not good enough here. instead of internal validation, they now have internal criticism as the default. And they're not getting the norm. to change that, what people have to realize it's not just changing a behavior. It's actually changing a core belief system because the belief system is it is my fault. That's why I wasn't validated. That's why I wasn't loved. I must not be good enough. I must not have value.

Their needs, their drives, their desires. We need that to be healthy. Then we need to be nurtured. We need people, that when we are in pain, they show love to us by coming beside us. Comforting us. Nurturing us. Helping us. Having empathy. And then we need encouragement. Because we are going to fail. Because we are weak. Because we are human. We are going to fall down. We are going to get discouraged. We are going to feel quitting. We are going to feel hopeless. And we need people to come beside us and encourage us. That's part of how you love people. As you encourage them. You build them up. But then we also need forgiveness. Because we are going to hurt people. We are going to fail people. And we need to have relationships where they are able to let that go. If we are truly sorry and change. And the relationship can be restored. That is part of love. And then we need lots of tenderness. Lots of gentleness. We need an environment. That has a softness to it. But firmness. But softness to it. That's part of love. And then we realize that if I am going to truly love. I need to learn healthy motives. I can't do the thing for the wrong reasons. I need to develop healthy motives. That's part of love. And then part of love comes out of humility. That you are just as important as me. Your needs matter. Your needs matter just as much as mine. And I need the attitude of humility as part of love. 11 key deep essential needs. That can all come under the umbrella of love. Then we talk about security. As being such a huge need for every individual. But that has a whole bunch of sub needs. first safety. We seek safety. We need protection. Our brain is wired to protect us. It's all about safety and keeping us safe. That is a massive need. Physical safety. Emotional safety. Spiritual safety. Relational safety. But then to have security we need provision. To know that our needs are going to be met. we need money in our culture.",

Otherwise we don't feel secure. boundaries comes under security. And then to feel secure a child needs a routine. They need a consistent life. They need to know that mom is going to be today the same today as she will be tomorrow. That she is not going to be on an emotional roller coaster and all over the map. We need consistency of personality of people around us. Consistency of behavior. We need consistency of routine. All of that creates a sense of security. But then we need guidance if we are going to feel secure. What is the best path to choose. What do I do in this situation. Wise behavior. What is unwise behavior. And then I need emotional regulation if I am going to feel secure. all of those things come under security. And that is a lot of nuances to the topic of security. Then we need a sense of purpose. Such a huge need. Some would put it under the spiritual category. But I am just going to put it separately. But it has sub needs. part of my sense of purpose comes through my career, through my job, through my vocation. And we need a job. We need to work. That is built into us. But more than that. Part of my sense of purpose always involves some type of service. To the environment. To animals. To other people. And part of my sense of purpose might be just volunteering.

Five, I wait until the last minute to complete a task. Six, I struggle to start unenjoyable tasks. Seven, I rarely waste time on nonessential activities. Eight, I often feel unproductive. Nine, I struggle to ask for help on tasks that are very challenging for me. Ten, I tell myself that I will do it later, but end up not doing it at all. Eleven, I struggle with staying focused for extended periods of time. Twelve, I feel anxious when faced with imminent deadlines. Thirteen, I delay tasks because attaining my high standards is tough. Fourteen, I have many incomplete tasks because I have many other things I want to do. Fifteen, I get distracted when I should keep working.

Something we need to pay attention to. number one, if you are exhausted, if you've been pushing yourself too hard, if you have not been doing proper self-care, meeting your 12 needs in a healthy way, you're going to be burning yourself out. now, when you have a new responsibility, your brain is going to go, I can't do this. I don't have the energy to do this. I want to procrastinate. It is trying to send you a warning sign. It is trying to tell you're overwhelmed, you're exhausted, you need to rest. You don't need to be thinking about more responsibilities. You need to be thinking about healthy self-care. And , if you're finding yourself wanting to procrastinate again, ask yourself, is this an unhealthy thing where I'm sliding into old behaviors for the wrong reasons. Or, is this actually my body sending me a healthy message saying you're exhausted, you need self-care. Second thing, is that most of us, when we are faced with a new responsibility, sometimes it would be very difficult, very unhealthy, to just take on that responsibility away without having thought it through carefully. We need to be able to give ourselves time, especially if it's a big responsibility, to go, what steps would be involved to accomplish this. What resources would that require. Will I need to involve others. Do I have the time and the strength now to do all of this stuff. Those are important questions. the danger for many people who've been procrastinating is to think, I just got to start a task away, but they haven't thought it through. They get into the task, they realize, -oh, this is too much, I don't have the time or the energy, and then they quit. Then they beat themselves up for quitting. And , there's a healthy planning stage in most important decisions. That isn't procrastination. That's actually taking the necessary steps and the necessary time to plan carefully. , let's look at dealing with the wounds from the past and the deep fears that those wounds have created as one aspect of healing procrastination. think back, first of all, to your earliest memory you have of when you procrastinated.",

And at some point, you have to say, really, I don't have any viable option except to work. Because nothing else works anymore. I might as buckle down and do it. And hopefully you'll do that. And you'll find it very rewarding. Now I got to add one thing. Let's say you decide I want to change. I put that little diagram up there for you. picture yourself back in addiction. if addiction is a very strong addiction, if addiction never got worse and worse and worse, you'd still be an addict. And what caused you to change as you were going along in your status quo of I'm an addict and I love it, is it got worse. And it got very painful. And pain makes us think, maybe I need to change something. And that's what pain did. And now people make changes and life gets better. And they go, great. This is fantastic. I'm glad I gave up drugs and alcohol and I'm living a clean life. But they're not prepared for what happens next once you start to change. And that's where it starts to feel it's going downhill. It starts to feel your life is getting worse again. let me take you to some of the things that will begin to happen as you start to change. the first thing is, all of a sudden you're entering unknown. Nobody told you how to live in this new way of life. You've never been in this new way of life before. And now you're going into unknown. And what happens when your brain hits unknown. It goes, -oh, something bad's going to happen. It always does. let's just sabotage. Because we're going to screw up anyways. Then the next thing that happens, the more healthy you get, life has less and less chaos and drama. And then you go, this is boring. This recovery is dull. let's have a bit of excitement. let's sabotage that as. And then all of a sudden you're working with people who are 40 and they act 40. You're 40 and you act 10.

You kind of felt in control. But now you're in this brand new life and you feel out of control. Because you don't know exactly what to do. And then I always picture a little kid that's going to go and dress up dad. they go in dad's closet and get out his suit. And then they come out and it's baggy and it's hanging off of them. I think that's what a lot of people feel in recovery. This doesn't feel. This is awkward. This feels it belongs to somebody else. I don't know if it fits. let's quit. All of that happens. And then all of a sudden you don't have your way of medicating all your emotions. And you start feeling guilt and sadness. Some fear. Some anxiety. Wow, if this is what change does, I feel worse. What was the point of changing. And then, now you've got to grow up and be responsible. You mean I've got to get out of bed every morning at 7. And go to work. And pay my bills on time. What's up with that. I want to go back to being that 10 year old again. what you begin to realize is this recovery and change is making more demands of you and calling for deeper commitments and becoming a responsible, reliable person. And that can feel a little bit restrictive. And we don't that. And then you're going to get your family or your friends that say we you the way you used to be. We don't the new you.

Change has many unseen or hidden things that will jump out and bite us. That all of a sudden make us wonder if the change was the decision. what I'm hoping as we go through this series is that you'll realize, I got to change just about everything. When I change, I'm going to feel good, then I'm going to feel worse for a little while, but stick at it because it will begin to be worth it.

In other words, devastation everywhere. Everything is a mess. Everything looks beyond repair. It looks hopeless. And now I want to watch, have you see what Nehemiah did next. Because what you're going to see next is where recovery begins. recovery doesn't begin by doing stuff on the outside. It begins by something happening on the inside. And if you look at the 12 steps of AA or any 12 step group, what you're going to see in these initial things that Nehemiah did, you're going to start to see the first four steps unfolding in his life. the first thing that he does, it says, when I heard this, I sat down and wept. In fact, for days I mourned and fasted. He was brokenhearted, he couldn't even eat. And he cried for days. I suspect some of you have been there. You've been at a bottom. You've seen the mess. And you're brokenhearted. And you just cry. But you cry without a solution. You cry with a sense of overwhelming pain and hopelessness. And that's where Nehemiah begins. By that deep, deep sorrow. But then he turns it into a. And you look at the 12 steps. What's step one. Powerless. That's what Nehemiah was feeling. What's step two. I think I need a power outside of myself greater than myself. I need some help here. And what does he say. He says, I prayed, O of , who keeps his covenant of unfailing love with those who love and obey his commandments, listen to my. Look down. See me night and day for your people Israel. And many of you at your bottom have just begged. You haven't had fancy words. You haven't wrapped it up nice and neat. a neat little churchy.

And you're not sure whether you can trust Him again. here's what he says. Please remember your promise. he's saying, I'm hanging on to something you promised. And your promise was this. If you're unfaithful, which they were to me, I will scatter you. in other words, we're in enemy territory as prisoners of war. But that's because you kept your promise. you were faithful to a promise. But you also said, if we return to you and we repent and obey and live by your commands, then you will bring us back. you've kept part one of your promise. Now I'm trusting you. I'm trusting you to keep part two. We are turning our hearts back to you. Now please help us rebuild our lives and our city. And he's hanging on to that. In Romans 8, says this. That He will take everything in your life. If you surrender to Him, He'll take the bad, all the mess, and He'll turn it into a positive. That's His promise. And what you're doing in recovery is saying, I'm not going to sit on the couch and just say, I trust you. Do all, clean up the mess and rebuild the city. I got to give it 100. I got to work hard. But I can't just work hard without your help. And we're going to work as a team now. And I'm going to trust your promise that if we surrender to you, you're going to help us rebuild this city. And our lives. And that is why I do what I do. Because if it was just me trying to help addicts, I'd be kind of stuck feeling. But has said, if you will surrender, I'll take all the bad stuff that you've done, all the mess you created, and it's going to be painful and it's going to be hard, but I will gradually turn that into positives in your life.

All of those things don't have to be stuff we beat ourselves up for. that is important. Self-compassion also must go to self-care. And that is going to include understanding common humanity. Understanding that all of us suffer. I can have compassion to other people suffering. I need to have the same compassion to myself. I can see a child being treated unjustly and my heart breaks for them. I need to have that same feeling towards myself. And it's not weakness to have that feeling. that becomes important. And then thirdly, self-care. Thirdly, self-compassion includes mindfulness. it's really instead of overreacting to feelings, being curious about feelings. Instead of judging myself, being harsh with myself because I'm feeling certain emotions, I go, I wonder what's going on here. I'm just going to be curious about it. And instead of going to a negative place when I feel certain emotions, I go to curiosity. That is an important part of self-care. Self-compassion. Let me add a couple other things because this is such an important concept. Self-compassion means you practice accepting the person you already are without making yourself jump through hoops to become more acceptable to your inner critic. a lot of people think without realizing it, I will accept myself when I get to this point. I can't accept myself now. part of recovery is there is a sense I don't accept where I'm at now. Just I wouldn't accept a child who's not walking. But I do accept that's all the child is capable of doing now. And that someday they're going to learn to walk. I accept and don't accept at the same time. The same is true in recovery. I accept that, yes, this is where I'm at. I'm not going to beat myself up. That doesn't mean I want to sit down. I'm not going to beat myself up. I'm going to stay there. I don't accept it in a sense because I want to change and grow. But I accept that this is where I'm at now.

Self-care has to have self-compassion. As long as there's that negativity towards myself, I'm going to stay depleted. somebody has said it's the golden rule in reverse. Do to yourself as you would do to others. you're great at taking care of everybody else. now treat yourself the same way. That is an important part. Become aware of that internal self-directed, directed anger at yourself that can be damaging. that can come out as shame. That inner critic that's always criticizing you. False guilt, true guilt. But many people just have this constantly directed anger at themselves. Become aware of that. And then develop rather than that internal critic that's always finding fault and putting you down and saying harsh things to you and judging you. Find a loving internal voice. It's still firm. It's still your cortex. It's a good parent that's pointing out things. But it's a loving, compassionate internal voice. And then allow yourself to be human. We have limitations. We can't do everything. We can't go without sleep, without food. We can't go 24-7. We need breaks. We're human. And part of self-care is learning to accept my humanness. Next one in self-care is don't let your limbic brain be your only guide. you need to listen to your limbic brain and go, oh, I am just feeling irritable. Oh, I am just feeling anxiety and depression. I need to listen to that and go, what's going on. But what my limbic brain then wants to do is if I just listen to my limbic brain, oh, I'm feeling irritable, tired. I just need to sit and do nothing all day today. my limbic brain can identify that something's not.",

    "text": "Welcome to another Friday night. We're looking at life traps or patterns of survival that children developed in early childhood because of the danger of their neglect or abuse, and they allowed them to survive. But now what they have found in adult life is that those very survival skills and tools and the patterns that developed in their thinking and emotions and behavior are now really messing up their adult relationships and their adult life. And they go to change them or they want to change them, but there's something in them that keeps drawing them back to repeat them, and they find that they're prisons. And tonight I want to look at two that I'm going to really combine, and it's approval-seeking and attention-seeking. And they're not identical, but they overlap, and there's similar core issues, and that's why I want to put them together. approval. Approval-seeking is I need you to me. I need you to approve of me. I need you to admire me, to respect me. Attention-seeking is I just need you to see me. Now hopefully when you see me, you're going to approve of me and respect me and admire me, but that's not the top priority. I'm just desperate to be seen. let me give you an example. Take a girl, a very beautiful girl, but she grows up in complex trauma and has never felt totally seen or totally loved. But what she has learned early on in life is that she gets a lot of positive attention from men when she flirts or when she wears something provocative, and she loves that attention. She doesn't get it at home, and it just feels good. And it gives her a feeling of being desirable. It gives her a feeling, a feeling of power, that she can wrap these people around her finger now. It's a wonderful feeling for her. But over time, she begins to realize that all of the attention she gets is people aren't really seeing her. They're just seeing her sexuality, and all the attention is physical, sexual. And she begins to resent that. She begins to feel used. And she, realizes, wow, they still don't see me. They only see a fantasy of me. And she decides, I'm going to quit this. I'm going to quit being provocative. I'm going to quit flirting.",

    "text": "I don't want this kind of attention. But she also sees that she's been manipulating men to try to get them to give her attention, and she's really, really upset with herself about how she's manipulated people all her life. And , she decides to quit. And she's proud of her decision. And she goes for a week without flirting or doing anything provocative. But the problem is, nobody gives her attention. Nobody fawns over her. Nobody gives her that look. And all of a sudden, all of the old feelings of being unseen and unloved and not worth anything and not being desirable, all come flooding down. And she doesn't want to give in to flirting because she knows that leads to sexual, physical desires in others. And she decides, I'm going to just sit in this feeling of being unloved and unseen and not desirable, this loneliness. I'm just going to sit in it. And maybe over time, people will begin to see me for who I am. she sits in it for a week. And she still doesn't get any attention. I'm going to quit. After a while, she goes, I can't live this. This is too much. I need to be desired. I need attention. I love that feeling. And she goes back to flirting and doing provocative things. And she hates it, but she can't stop doing it. She wants to quit doing it, but she has to do it. It's become a prison for her. that's what we're talking about here. Now, when we talk about this attention seeking and this approval seeking, there's really kind of two types. There's the very overt in your face. They don't hide the fact that they're trying to get attention, be the center of attention, be noticed, be approved of, looking for compliments. And then there's the very covert where they drop hints. They fish for compliments without really coming out and saying them. They're fishing for compliments. They put themselves down, but really it's that you'll build them up and say, oh no, you're wonderful. They give you gifts. They do little things for you, hoping that you will approve of them and give them compliments. it's very much covert. some people go to that very overt. Others are very covert. Then what you will notice is it can work itself out in different ways.",

    "text": "And some can have a variety of these ways. Some can only kind of major on one of these ways. But some, their attention seeking and approval seeking is very much in the verbal realm. They're bragging. They're telling stories, sensational stories. They're gossiping in order to get noticed and get approval. it's always kind of with their words. Others, they rely more on their actions. they serve others. They accomplish things and look for rewards and they look for recognition because of that. Others rely on their position. if they get in a position that's prominent, a position that's prestigious, then they're going to get notice. They're going to get approval. it's very much seeking position for them. Others, it's very much they're looking for something. Others, it's very much in social settings. They just impulsively do things to grab the limelight, to get notice, to get approval. it's very much within social settings, certain behaviors. And then others, they don't even try to do things to get kind of direct attention on themselves. They just try to become friends with somebody who gets lots of attention and approval and then just kind of be in their shadow. And hope that, the moon, the glory of the sun will shine on them and people will notice them because they're connected to this superstar. those are different avenues that people have for gaining attention and approval. what's important to understand is the common factor in both of these life traps is that one's identity, sense of self-esteem, is dependent primarily on the reactions of others, not on one's own sense of inherent value. I need others to approve of me in order to feel good about myself. I don't have that feeling good about myself inherently within me. And all of behaviors are trying to get others to keep feeding my need to feel good about myself. And the person doesn't develop a secure sense of self. They continue to depend on others to provide the feelings of self. it often then includes this overemphasis on status, appearance, social acceptance, money, achievement, any kind of thing that will gain them approval, gain them attention. somebody has said this, these children tend to do in school and be behaved because they're seeking approval.",

    "text": "They also tend to be accepted into social groups easily as they are either helpful and accommodating or impressive and high achieving. As such, and this is the key point, having the approval seeking, recognition seeking schema or life trap as a child often goes unnoticed. It often is seen as a positive quality. It is often seen as a good thing. Instead, it is usually within late adult lessons and adulthood that the individual will start feeling the strain of continually acting in a way to gain approval or recognition instead of behaving authentically. In other words, people don't see this life trap as a problem until later on and then they start to realize there's just a constant stress and anxiety that they're feeling and that they never feel they can be their authentic selves. One of the things that happens with this is that people begin also to realize that all of the major decisions in their life start to feel somewhat unsatisfying because it hasn't been a decision based on what you're doing, what they want, who they are. It's always been, I wonder what others will approve of. I wonder what others will. it's almost others are making the major decisions of your life for you and you're not making them based on who you really are. And you begin to really get tired of that and notice I'm feeling very unfulfilled, deep down. But then more than that, everything is dependent on I need others to approve of me constantly. And if I'm not getting constant approval, you begin to feel rejection, rejection, rejection. And rejection more and more begins to be something you struggle with, feelings of rejection when really it's because you didn't get the approval you were wanting that day. And you seek more and more for approval, but then what you find is people get onto you and they get tired of you constantly seeking attention or approval. And now the actual opposite begins to happen. People don't give you attention or approval because that's all you want. And they start sending boundaries with you. And all of a sudden, people are getting tired of you. And the very thing you're craving, you're getting less and less because people refuse to get it.",

    "text": "Somebody has said this, you may experience an excessive compulsion or need to receive approval from others that can influence your decisions on what you pursue and how you interact with people. Importantly, when this approval is given, it can make your day seem fantastic. You just are top of the world. Whereas if it is slightly withdrawn, people don't give you much approval that day, things can come crashing down around you emotionally. you're now on an emotional roller coaster based on whether people are giving you lots of approval or not. This can leave our sense of self-esteem on very wobbly legs and highly dependent on the opinions and agendas of other people. When activated, this life's trap may understandably trigger our moods to swing depending on what others say about us or try to build high achievement in areas that are important to us in an attempt to gain approval. As a result, we may experience frustrations and anxiety or a sense of being inauthentic to our true selves. We may also become highly sensitive to any form of criticism or rejection. It can result in confused identities or feelings of emptiness. This schema is particularly problematic as approval is dependent from many factors beyond our control. Yet it dictates how we feel about our self. The true need behind this schema is to feel confident in our core sense of self and worthy or lovable as who we are, independent from the opinion of others. And we'll get to that. let's go to our test. answer one, if it's completely untrue of you. Two, if it's mostly untrue of you. Three, if it's slightly more true than untrue. Four, if it's moderately true. Five, if it's mostly true. And six, if it describes you perfectly. And if you have a five or six answer to any of the questions, then this could be a life trap that is significant for you. question one, I worry a lot about what people think of me. Two, many of my decisions have been based on what other people will think. Three, in social situations I get anxious that people are judging me or don't me. Four, I tend to change how I act and talk depending on who I am with. Five, I don't feel I have a strong sense of identity.",

You seek excessive reassurance from others that you've done or are doing the thing. You feel unconfident about decisions you've made or are making. You reject opportunities and experiences you want because you worry whether others will approve of it. You feel ashamed if someone questions or dislikes something you do or say.

She says, each one of us has a sex life, whether completely internal and wish for or actually lived in real time. the key point is everybody has a sex life. Doesn't have to be just acted out sex. It could be a total internal fantasy world sex, but it's still a sex life. we must take this as a given that everybody has a sex life. Some clients may have. Made their peace with whatever expression is or has been in their sex life, including asexuality. Some of are totally with that, but others haven't made peace with this sex life that they have.

Longing to be touched deprivation or body hatred. Many feel robbed. Many feel cheated. I think that's said. Then she says this beginning my journey towards sex therapy certification. I was surprised to learn just how wide the range is of sexual fantasy, sexual pleasure and sexual behavior. I was much less sexually intelligent than I thought I was. In turn, I learned how narrow and arbitrary the window viewed as normal is. our cultures developed kind of this window of what we consider normal sexual behavior. And what she began to realize is that's quite narrow. And who made up those rules. It seems arbitrary. although the media bombard us with sexual imagery and titillation, we continue to be hard pressed to find and access reliable and useful sexuality information. The subject of sex still appears to be a point of shame or taboo or ignorance. Many of our clients struggle to understand. there's tons of sexual. Images and sexual titillation in our media. But there's not clear talk about sex to help people understand sex. And many of our clients really don't understand their sexuality very is the point.

And it's hard to believe or even think that anger might be a good thing in certain situations. here's how anger was designed to work. In us, we have this built-in, without even realizing it, moral system of what is love. And we know that if you love somebody and want a healthy relationship, you have to be honest, you have to be reliable, you have to be faithful, you have to communicate, you have to respect each other, you have to be consistent and fair. That's built in. It's into our DNA. if somebody lies, what do we do. We get angry. And what the anger is saying is, alert, alert. Alert, something is wrong here that should not continue because if it continues, it will damage this relationship and it will damage each other. anger was designed, number one, to alert you that something was either unloving, disrespectful, unfair, and not true. And then the second thing, it was to give you the motivation to make it again. And it was to give you the motivation to make it again. And it was to give you the motivation to make it again. And it was to give you the motivation to say, we got to talk about this. that it could be resolved that the relationship would go back to honesty and fairness and consistency and reliability. anger was a beautiful system that was designed to protect love and loving relationships. That's important. And secondly, anger was designed to be resolved. that if something's unloving, it will not be resolved. It resolves it, and then the anger goes away. There's no more need for it because it is resolved. that's the original design. And what helps that whole system is that when you are angry, your brain releases a chemical called cortisol. And that chemical is only released with anger and fear, slash stress. Danger. and fear, slash stress. Danger. Corsosol is the chemical that gives you the adrenaline rush. It gives you extra energy. It makes you hyper-focused. And it is saying, this has to get fixed. This has to get resolved. And it's giving you all the help possible to have the energy and the desire to resolve this, to return it to love. what happens in complex trauma.",

    "text": "This is the vacuum effect. A narcissistic family system is a closed pressure system, and the scapegoat serves as its primary pressure release valve. Every unresolved tension, every repressed rage, every ounce of existential dread is vented through them. When that valve is suddenly irrevocably sealed shut, the pressure doesn't just dissipate. It builds and it builds rapidly until the containing walls of the system begin to fracture and burst. The immediate aftermath is a frenzy of desperation. I've seen it manifest in ways that would be darkly comical if they weren't tragic. I had one client, a young man who finally moved across the country to escape a lifetime of being blamed for his mother's unhappiness. Two weeks after he left, his family filed a missing persons report. When the police located him perfectly safe and employed, his mother insisted to the officers that he had been brainwashed and was a danger to himself. This wasn't concern. This was a desperate attempt to reassert control, to pathologize his escape, to drag him back into his designated role as the family's primary problem. In another case, a mother had a full-blown psychotic break when her son, the family scapegoat, refused to answer her calls for a month. Her identity was fused with her role as the long-suffering mother of a difficult child that without him to blame for her misery, her entire psychological structure disintegrated. She had nowhere to project her demons, they turned inward and consumed her. And what happens when these initial frantic attempts to retrieve the scapegoat fail. The system, in its pathological wisdom, understands it cannot function without a blame absorber, and begins the desperate, panicked scramble for a new scapegoat. It's a grim game of musical chairs. The music stops, and the remaining family members look at each other with dawning horror, wondering who will be the next to be cast into the void. Very often, the role falls to the one who is least equipped to handle it, the golden child. The perfect one, who has spent their entire life propped up by the implicit comparison to the bad one, suddenly finds themselves in the crosshairs. For the first time, their minor flaws are magnified into catastrophic failures. Their achievements are no longer good enough.",

    "text": "They are engaging in a perpetual, low-grade ritual sacrifice to maintain their own diseased equilibrium. And here's absolutely devastating. The family members genuinely don't understand why they feel lost without their punching bag. They experience the scapegoat's departure not as the removal of a victim, but as an act of profound betrayal and abandonment. They feel wronged. They feel wounded. Their grief and panic are, in their own minds, completely genuine because they are utterly blind to the role they forced the scapegoat to play. They don't miss the person. They miss the function that person served. They miss the stability that came from having a designated repository for all their darkness. This leads to the most practical and dangerous part of the immediate aftermath, the hoovering. Just a hoover vacuum cleaner, the family will try with all its might to suck the escaped scapegoat back into the system. This can take many forms. There's love bombing sudden, uncharacteristic declarations of affection and remorse. There are manufactured crises, a sudden illness, a financial emergency, a dramatic family fight that only you can solve. And of course, there are the guilt trips deployed with surgical precision. How could you do this to us after everything we've done for you. These are not good faith attempts at reconciliation. They are the desperate, calculated maneuvers of an addict trying to secure their next child. What can we do to help to fix this. Now, if you think that initial chaos is bad, wait until you see what happens when the narcissistic parent realizes their primary source of emotional regulation and narcissistic supply has permanently dried up. The panic then begins to curdle into something far more malevolent. I've seen 60-year-old mothers have complete psychological breakdowns because their scapegoat child blocked them on Facebook. Now stop and think about that for a moment. for a moment. Think about how pathologically, terrifyingly dependent that is. An entire adult identity, a life built over six decades, fragile that it can be shattered by a single click on a social media website. This isn't just a matter of hurt feelings or a family squabble. This is an existential crisis. It's the desperate, flailing panic of an addict whose drug supply has been abruptly and permanently cut off. You have to understand this, and it's a crucial point. Narcissistic parents are not merely seeking attention.",

    "text": "They are addicts, and their drug of choice is something called narcissistic supply. And the scapegoat is their primary, uncut, high-grade source of that supply. What is supply. It's the emotional reaction, any emotional reaction they can provoke from you. It's your anger, your tears, your frantic, attempts to defend yourself, your pained silence, your desperate pleas for fairness. All of it. To the narcissist, these reactions are fuel. They are proof of their power, their relevance, their very existence. They get a neurochemical hit from the drama and conflict. A surge of dopamine and adrenaline that reassures them they are the center of the universe. When they torment their scapegoat, they are not just being cruel, they are self-medicating. what happens when that supply vanishes. What happens when the scapegoat stops reacting, stops pleading, stops fighting back. It triggers a full-blown identity collapse in the narcissistic parent. You have to ask yourself if your entire sense of self, your very identity, is built upon the flimsy foundation of being better than someone else. The long-suffering parent, the righteous martyr, the misunderstood victim of a difficult, child. What happens when that someone else disappears from the stage. Who are you then. The answer is terrifying. You are nothing. The entire edifice of their self worth was a comparative illusion. And when the point of comparison is removed, the illusion dissolves into a terrifying void. I worked with the family of a man, a father who for 30 years had built his local reputation on the story of his failure of a son. Every conversation at the pub, every conversation at the pub, every conversation at the pub, every conversation at the pub, every family gathering was an opportunity for him to lament his son's poor choices, his lack of ambition, his ingratitude. It was his favorite story, the one that defined him as a patient, burdened patriarch. Then the son, a quiet but resilient man, moved away, finished a doctorate, started a wildly successful business, and cut off all contact. The father was absolutely decimated. He couldn't function. People would ask him how his son was doing, and he would stammer and change the subject. His central narrative, the pillar of his identity, had been demolished. He had no story left to tell.",

    "text": "In a very real sense, the scapegoat is the unwitting hero of their own family myth. Their story perfectly parallels Joseph Campbell's monomyth, The Hero's Journey. They receive the call to adventure, the realization that they must leave. They cross the threshold into the unknown. They face the drag and the family trauma and the subsequent smear campaign. And they slay it by surviving and healing. They return to the unknown. Not to their old home, but to the world bearing the elixir of their own hard, one wisdom and integrated self. Now this transformation doesn't happen overnight. And it's not without its challenges. The journey is fraught with grief, with doubt, with the lonely work of rebuilding a life from the ground up. But there's something profound that occurs when the scapegoat finally understands the truth of their own story. A revelation that re-frames them, and that's the end of the entire experience. I want you to imagine something. Imagine discovering that being rejected by your family, the single most painful foundational wound of your life, was actually the greatest gift they could have possibly given you. Now that sounds monstrous, doesn't it. It sounds a perverse justification for abuse. But I want you to set that aside for a moment and really grapple with the idea, because that is the final liberating and terrifyingly profound truth that every escaped scapegoat must eventually confront if they are to be truly free. This is the ultimate reframe. It's the alchemy of the soul, turning the lead of your deepest pain into the gold of your most profound wisdom. To see that being cast out was not a damnation, but a liberation. You weren't exiled from paradise. You were ejected from a gulag. You weren't denied love. You were freed from a pathological, pathological imitation of it that would have poisoned you to the very marrow of your being. Your family, in their blindness and their pathology, in their desperate need to expel the one person who carried the light of truth, gave you the one thing they never intended to a chance to have an actual life. Your life. And you have to understand this pattern, this role you were forced to play, it didn't start with you. What you were carrying was not just your parents' death. It was darkness.",

    "text": "The former scapegoats, the ones who are called too sensitive, develop an empathy that is profound it's almost a superpower. They can see the pain in others because they have mapped its every contour in their own souls. And because of this, they often become the healers. The therapists, the counselors, the advocates, the artists who guide others out of the same darkness they escaped. They take on the responsibility of being the lamplighters. This is the deepest of all existential truths. This is what Viktor Frankl was talking about. It is the ability and indeed the responsibility of the individual to create meaning out of their suffering. Your life was chaos and pain. But by confronting it, by refusing to be defined by it, and by choosing to build something new from its ruins, you engage in the most profound act of meaning creation possible. And this raises the ultimate question, the one that every escaped scapegoat must answer for themselves, what does it mean to be truly free when that freedom comes at the cost of the very family that was supposed to be your foundation. The answer is that you learn that a foundation built on lies is no foundation at all. It's a trapdoor. And true freedom means learning to build your own foundation on solid ground with materials of your own choosing. This is where you create your chosen family. You find the other people who value truth, who practice reciprocity, who have the courage to celebrate your strengths and the compassion to support your weaknesses. You build your own tribe, your own support system, not based on the accident of blood, but on the conscious choice of mutual respect and authentic connection. You build the arc that will carry you and the ones you truly love through the next flood. And you have a solemn duty to do this, not just for yourself, but for your children, for the future. You have to consider the legacy. How do you raise children in a way that ensures they will never know the role of the scapegoat or the golden child. You do it by modeling authenticity, by respecting their individuality, and by taking responsibility for your own damn shadow you never have to project it onto them.",

    "text": "I see the vast majority. What you're telling me here is about your childhood. Because gut feelings are essential for survival. We evolved out there in nature. For millions of years, the humanoid ancestors of our species lived out there in nature, as did our own species live out in nature for most of our existence as a species. out of the 150,000, 200,000 years that Homo sapiens has walked the Earth, if that can be represented in one hour, then until about five minutes ago, we lived out there in nature. How long does any creature in nature survive if they're not in touch with their gut feelings. that being in touch with our bodies and our emotions is essential also. Terrific. But what happens is that for the sake of fitting with the family, or with a culture that doesn't particularly support our authenticity, we have to give up our connection to ourselves, our authenticity, for the sake of attachment. Then, being inauthentic, being out of touch with ourselves, is how we survive. We're afraid to be ourselves because we associate being ourselves with a threat of being rejected. And this means that for the rest of our lives, we're going to be in relationships where we're afraid to be ourselves to really say what it feels for us. Now that has terrific implications. When I say terrific, I mean significant implications. A study I quote in the book, they followed 2,000 women over 10 years. Over a 10-year period, those women who were unhappily married and didn't express their feelings were four times as likely to die as those women who were unhappily married, but they did talk about their feelings. that inauthenticity, which is not a moral judgment on my part, it's something people do in order to survive their childhoods, but that exacts a major cost in terms of physical and mental health. Not to mention your relationships where you're afraid to be yourself, where you're in a relationship and you don't even. Your partner doesn't even know you because you're afraid to be yourself. you feel alone even when you're partnered because if you're not known, you're going to feel alone. It doesn't matter how many people surround you. the price that we pay for inauthenticity is huge, and yet many of us survived our childhoods and when you put your hand up.",

need to take responsibility for their wounds no human being should ever be enlisted into the role of being another person's punching bag or pacifier that is not how life works and there's and the fact of the matter is that the narcissistic person will gobble the other person up alive they don't care i think it's getting your head around that this person actually doesn't care they may even be people say but they're smart they're smart how could they not care i'm why do you think smart and care have anything to do with each other they are smart and they don't care that could be one sentence and i think people struggle with that they'll say they're really good at this or they're such a good cook good they're a good cook and they don't care you can have this as one sentence people are coming up with these strange constructions but i hear you when you say that they do have wounds and people there are many many the vast majority of wounded people out there do the work they go and they face those demons painful as it is and that is something that narcissistic person could do but again they should it's a choice not to and that's the hardest part of all of this but i also know that not everyone can walk away this isn't about walking away that's not the only path forward it's knowing what it is and knowing how to engage in it if somebody never listens to you and you're not talking to them and they're not talking to you and they're not talking to you and they're not talking to you talks over you has no empathy for you has no interest in you laughs and mocks you laughs at you and mocks you when you share an emotion tells you're ridiculous and gas lights you then that really should be a wake-up call that you shouldn't be sharing anything with them you want to talk to them about the weather do it you want to talk to them about the dodger game fine but don't talk to them about anything else i mean it's the equivalent of having a really precious antique in your home and giving it to someone who's drunk and you're not talking to them because you're not doing anything for them what does leaving them drunk mean for us they may not you have gone to work you've lost a job you've got no work you read some wrong stuff but what if someone's there that you can find and you getgraphed to help them come out of that they're why are you feeling this is the thing i don't understand why there is this the mental'm beating me up and waking me up for talking that's might come out it could be anything could be a partner and in those situations one of your big things is don't engage or engage as minimal as possible you just kind of broke it down but i think you have a framework for that it's i say don't go deep don't defend don't defend don't engage don't explain and don't personalize what types of relationships in our life as an example because i'm sure there's some relation that may not work with a spouse true potentially it will absolutely because you're not engaging when they say why don't you ever take out the trash and you're the one taking out the trash every single day three times a day don't defend yourself and say that they're not they're looking for a fight they're not looking for a quantitative breakdown of the number of times you take out the trash they're not interested in the truth they're interested in bashing you when they say why don't you take out the trash more often you're and that's your answer instead of saying but i take out the i took the trash out three times yesterday in fact i know i took it out three times yesterday because it was raining no you don't explain many people won't say but i want them to hear my point of view they're not listening they're not listening and sometimes people say but i want to defend myself i said if you want to then do it then be prepared to be gas lighted or yes an easier way than to become a boozepl over be prepared to be humiliated i'll say do whatever you want but then you need to be prepared for what's going to come back at you and if you don't want those things to happen to you then don't do it and i think people get sad they're saying are you telling me that all there's really left to talk about with my spouse if i don't want to fight with them is the weather and the change of season and that the freeway might be closed this weekend i'm and they'll say i feel really sad and i said let's compare it to what this relationship's been that's been really sad too i think that this don't go deep really shows the relationship for what it is and there's a lot of grief this whole process is riddled with grief people wanted these to be not just marriages that lasted but marriages that were healthy and had depth that they will never have and radical acceptance is you can stay but this is never going to be a deep intimate connected person who stands by your side on tough times relationship it's just not you better start building up the supports who will be your people when you do have your tough days when you need that ride to a chemo appointment when you need someone to talk to you when you get scary medical news when you're going through a dark night of the soul after

    "text": "Listen, you don't need to fight. You don't need to explain yourself. And you sure as hell don't need to waste your energy trying to prove your worth to a narcissist. Stood, because here's the truth. Empaths already hold the most powerful weapon in the room silence. And today I'm gonna break down seven silent moves empaths make. Moves that look simple, but they drive narcissists absolutely insane. Understood. These aren't tricks. These aren't games. These are grounded practical shifts in how you carry yourself. And when you understand them, you stop being controlled and you start taking your power back. buckle up because after today, you'll never look at silence the same way again. Most people misunderstand silence. They think being quiet means you're shy, passive, or maybe even scared. But silence isn't weakness. Silence is one of the strongest strategies you can ever use, misunderstood. Especially when you're dealing with someone who thrives on control drama and chaos. Narcissists feed off reactions. They want the argument. They want the attention. They wanna feel they can pull your strings and make you dance. Misunderstood. The second you engage, the second you try to defend, they win. But when you stay silent, you interrupt their script. You strip away their favorite weapon, your emotional response. Think about it. When someone throws a jab at you, understood, what's your instinct. To clap back. To prove your point. To correct them. To defend yourself. That's exactly what a narcissist is counting on. They bait you. They hook you. And then they reel you into their world of blame and confusion. It's understood. But if you choose silence, you don't take the bait. You're standing in your power without lifting a finger. Silence is not about shutting down. It's about, choosing not to play a game that's rigged against you from the start. Understood. Silence doesn't mean you're ignoring reality. It means you've decided to respond with intention instead of reaction. It's saying, I see what you're doing, but I don't have to give you what you want. That's strategy. Understood. You're not playing small. You're playing smart. And the truth is, silence often speaks louder than anything you could say. When you stop explaining yourself, stop defending yourself. Understood. Stop trying to convince someone who doesn't even wanna understand you. You create a shift.",

    "text": "To detachment is the ability to step back, observe the game, and say, I see what you're doing and I'm not playing. That kind of calm neutrality is toxic to a narcissist. Why. Because it starves them. They need emotional highs and lows. Der stood. They thrive on extremes. They want to make you angry, then real. You back in with charm, then push you away again. It's a cycle designed to keep you hooked. A detachment breaks the cycle. It says, your storm isn't my storm. Sunder stood. I'm standing over here in the calm. And there is nothing more infuriating to someone who wants chaos than realizing you're not participating. One of the clearest signs of detachment is when you stop explaining yourself. Der stood. Narcissists love explanations because explanations give them something to twist, something to argue with, something to use against you. But when you detach, you don't over-explain. You just act. Stood. You don't respond to manipulation with a long speech. You simply let the silence hang. You don't chase down their shifting moods. You let them ride it out while you keep your peace. That's kryptonite to them. Tud. Because they can't work with nothing. Detachment also shows up in your body language, your tone, your energy. Imagine a narcissist throwing a tantrum, yelling, throwing accusations, and instead of matching their energy, you stay calm. Sunder stood. Your voice stays steady. Your face doesn't change. You don't roll your eyes. You don't slam doors. You don't escalate. You just hold your ground. That calmness is unbearable for them because they're expecting chaos. They need the chaos. Stood. And when they can't get it from you, they lose one of their greatest sources of energy. They lose one of their greatest sources of control. For empaths, this kind of detachment can feel unnatural at first. You're used to feeling everything, to absorbing the moods of people around you. Sunder stood. To taking responsibility for their emotions. But here's the truth. Detachment is one of the highest forms of self-care. It's the recognition that someone else's chaos doesn't belong to you. Stood. You can love people and still detach from their dysfunction. You can care about someone and still refuse to be controlled. That balance is what keeps your empathy powerful instead of draining.

You're choosing peace over chaos. Clarity over confusion. Understood. Self-respect over control. And once you detach, they can't touch you in the same way because nothing they throw at you lands the way it used to. Energy is everything. It's not just how awake you feel in the morning or how tired you are at night. Sunder stood. It's the life force you carry into every conversation, every decision, every relationship. And if you're an empath, it's magnetic. People feel it. People feed off it. And narcissists, more than anyone else, understood, will drain it dry if you let them. That's why protecting your energy is not optional. It's power. Because the moment you stop handing it over freely, you reclaim control of your life. Narcissists operate energy vampires. Sunder stood. They thrive on pulling you into arguments, making you defend yourself, getting you to overthink every word, every action. Every time you spin in circles trying to figure them out, Sunder stood. You're spending energy that you could be using to build your own peace, your own goals, your own joy. They count on the fact that you won't notice how much they're draining you. Sunder stood. But the second you realize your energy is the most valuable currency you have, everything changes. You stop giving it away to people who haven't earned it. Protecting your energy doesn't always mean cutting people out completely. Sunder stood. Sometimes it means setting limits. Maybe you shorten the time you spend with someone. Maybe you answer fewer texts. Maybe you take longer to respond. Maybe you pause before engaging with someone's negativity. Sunder stood. These aren't small acts. They're huge. Because every time you choose to withhold your energy, you're choosing yourself over the chaos. And that choice sends a message louder than any words. Sunder stood. I matter more than your manipulation. Narcissists hate this because they're used to having unlimited access to your attention. They're used to being able to snap their fingers and pull you into their drama. Sunder stood. When you start protecting your energy, that access is cut off. Suddenly, they can't drain you the way they used to.",

You feel other people's emotions as if they were your own. But here's the truth. Constantly pouring yourself out doesn't help anyone, least of all you. When your energy is depleted, you can't show up as your best self. You can't create. Sunder stood. You can't focus. You can't even enjoy the things that make you happy. Protecting your energy is how you make sure you stay full enough to give in healthy, intentional ways instead of being blood dry. Dur stood. One of the most powerful ways to protect your energy is through awareness. Pay attention to how you feel around people. Notice who leaves you feeling drained and who leaves you feeling uplifted. That awareness alone is a game changer. Sunder stood. Because once you see the patterns, you can make different choices. Protecting your energy doesn't have to be dramatic or confrontational. Sometimes it's as simple as choosing silence instead of engaging, choosing space instead of proximity. Stood. Choosing rest instead of overextending. And the best part, protecting your energy doesn't just weaken a narcissist's grip on you. It strengthens your grip on yourself. You start to feel stronger, calmer, clearer. Stood. You stop being reactive and start being intentional. You realize you don't have to fight every battle. You don't have to prove every point. You don't have to waste your energy trying to change someone who doesn't want to change. Dur stood. That's freedom. That's power. Protecting your energy gives you.

Narcissists in particular thrive on chaos because chaos means they're in control. If they can trigger you, Dur stood. They know they've got you. That's why a calm response is such a powerful disruptor. It's the exact opposite of what they're counting on. Instead of handing them the drama they crave, you give them nothing but composure.",

It doesn't mean you're letting them win. Sundar stood. It means you've decided to take the wheel of your own reactions. And that control over yourself is something a narcissist can never handle. They want to dictate how you feel, how you react, how you see yourself. But when you remain calm, Dur stood, you show them that you are not a puppet. You are not at the mercy of their manipulation. You're the one who decides what energy you bring into the moment. Imagine a narcissist throwing accusations at you. You never do anything. Sundar stood. You're selfish. You don't care about me. Most people's instinct is to fight back. That's not true. Look at all the things I've done for you. And suddenly, Dur stood, your knee deep in a defensive argument that was designed to trap you from the start. But a calm response shuts it down. You don't raise your voice. You don't start listing proof. You keep your tone steady, maybe even neutral. Sundar stood. And you say something simple , I see that's how you feel. No defense, no fuel, just calm acknowledgement. And then you move on. That's infuriating for them because they're weapons. Your reaction is gone. Calm doesn't mean weak, Sundar stood. Calm is strength under control. It takes more discipline to stay composed in the face of provocation than it does to lash out. Anyone can yell. Anyone can throw a tantrum. It takes real power to stay grounded. And narcissists know this, Sundar stood. When you stay calm, they realize they can't rattle you the way they want to. They may try harder. They may escalate. But the more consistent you are, the more powerless they become. For empaths, misunderstood. Calm responses are especially powerful because you naturally feel the urge to defend yourself, to explain, to smooth things over. But explanations feed the cycle. A calm response, on the other hand, ends it, understood. It communicates that you're not available for manipulation. It draws a line without raising your voice.

You want to fix things. You want to believe people can change. But the truth is staying in a toxic dynamic doesn't help anyone. It doesn't heal them, and it only drains you. Understood, walking away isn't about abandoning your empathy. It's about directing it where it belongs, back to yourself. It's self-respect and action. It's choosing to pour your love and compassion into a space where it can actually grow, understood, instead of into a relationship that only consumes it. Walking away doesn't always mean cutting ties forever. Sometimes it means stepping back for an hour a day, a week to regain your clarity. It's understood. Sometimes it means leaving the room when the conversation turns toxic. Sometimes it means cutting contact completely when you realize nothing will ever change, stood. Every version of walking away carries the same power because it communicates the same truth. You won't be controlled. And that message hits harder than any counter-argument ever could.

Picture this. A narcissist throws one of their usual fits. They're yelling, accusing, throwing blame everywhere. In the past, you'd stay and fight, try to defend yourself or smooth things over. But this time, you don't take the bait. You stand up. You calmly walk out and you don't look back. That's silence. That exit. That calm refusal to engage. That is what hits them the hardest.

They want to reset the cycle. They want to know that even in silence, they still have a grip on your mind. And every single day you don't react, you take that power back. When a narcissist loses access to you, suddenly develop self-awareness or remorse. What they do instead is twist the silence into a mirror, hoping you'll look into it and start questioning yourself. They want your guilt, your self-doubt, your second guessing. Narcissists know that guilt is a powerful hook. And if they can't reach you physically, they'll do everything they can to help you. And they'll do everything they can to help you. And they'll do everything they can to manipulate your mind. No contact isn't just a boundary to them. It's a blow to their ego. But instead of admitting fault, they flip the narrative. Suddenly, you become the problem. Cold. You gave up on them. All of this is designed to make you feel you're the one who caused the damage.

Even in silence, even with no contact, they still want to dominate your mental and emotional space. They want your obsession. Not the kind of obsession where you run after them, but the subtle, subtle, where you can't stop thinking about what happened, what you could have done differently, what they might be doing now. That's the goal. If they can no longer get your attention in real time, they'll settle for controlling your thoughts from a distance. Because for a narcissist, being remembered, being felt is almost as satisfying as being physically present. When you're in a situation where you're in a situation where you're in a situation where you're obsessing, you're emotionally activated. You might be reliving old arguments, analyzing their behavior, decoding their mixed signals, or constantly refreshing social media to see if they've posted something new. That obsession is energy. It's focus. And they love knowing they still have that kind of power over you without even having to say a word. It means the bond isn't really broken. It's just shifted. They don't need a conversation when they've already set up shop in your mind. This is why narcissists leave relationships in a cloud of confusion. They rarely give you closure. They won't admit fault. They won't clarify intentions. And they definitely won't validate your pain. Instead, they'll ghost you, discard you, or go cold with zero explanation, because they know that confusion is the fastest way to create obsession. Your brain hates unfinished stories. It craves answers. when someone suddenly disappears or flips the script without warning, your mind kicks into overdrive, trying to make sense of it. And that's exactly what they want. The more you obsess, the more control they still have. They might even plant false hope before going south. Maybe they hinted at a future together. Maybe they apologized just enough to keep you hanging.",

Because they've conditioned you through cycles of love, bombing, devaluation, and emotional chaos. They've trained your nervous system to crave their attention, to fear abandonment. And. To seek their approval, even when it hurts. when you go a no contact, they're not panicking. They're waiting. They expect you to break first. Believe they have a kind of hold over you.

They want the last word, even if it's a lie. When a narcissist loses direct access to you, they don't suddenly stop trying to take from you. They just switch methods. If they can't get your attention, your affection, or your physical presence, they'll go after your energy, quietly, subtly, from afar. Narcissists are energy thieves.

Because the gut is connected to the brain, in fact, the gut sends many more connections than vice versa. When the gut receives messages from the brain, it reads them and it magnifies them and sends them back up to the brain. the gut feelings tell you the whole picture. Your thoughts only tell you a small part of the picture. people who had a stroke in the part of the brain where language is processed, these are called aphasiacs, they're better able to tell when somebody's lying than the average person who can understand speech. Why do you suppose. Since they don't understand the words, what are they paying attention to. The gut feelings, which read the body language of the person. The facial expression. The congruity of the mouth and the eyes. When the person is smiling, is it just the mouth all smiling. Have you seen the parliamentary debate on CBC. When the politicians stand up and they smile. They're grinning here, there's nothing up here. It makes you uncomfortable to look at it. Anybody with gut feelings would turn the TV off. Now, there's another large group of people, another large group of human beings who read gut feelings accurately and respond to them. And what do we call those people. Children. Small children. Young babies don't listen to words, they don't even understand them. But they react unerringly and intuitively to gut feelings. Now, guess what. When you put your hand up and told me that you've had stronger feelings that you've ignored and you were sure afterwards because you believed your intellect rather than your guts, you told me the story of your childhood. And the story of your childhood is that you were born with the gut feelings intact and connected completely. But at some point something happened to you. At some point you got the message that in order to survive and to be acceptable you have to suppress your gut feelings. Because here's how it works. Children have two needs. Infants. Anybody. Any human being. We have two basic needs. And the more immature we are the more important the first need becomes. And that's for attachment.",

    "text": "And attachment means that connection with another human being for the purpose of being taken care of. That's an absolute need of the small child. Can't live without it. Impossible. that's one large need. Another need, however, we have to function as fully human beings is to be authentic. Authentic means that we know who we are, what we feel are able to express it and able to honor it in our behavior. we have the need for attachment and we have the need for authenticity. far good. But what happens if in order to attach we have to suppress our authenticity. Because our parents can't handle who we are. Because they can't handle our anger because they can't handle our two year olds because they can't handle our expression of our needs because they are too stressed they are too needy my mother was in that terrible situation. Then we suppress who we are we suppress our authenticity and we suppress our awareness of our gut feelings because the expression of them would bring us into conflict with our caregivers and threaten our attachments. And our problem as adults is that we a lot of our behaviors are still coming out of our need to attach we are still behaving little kids who need to attach and need to be liked and need to be accepted and approved of at the expense of our authenticity. And that people is what makes us sick. Now a fourth connection I didn't even know about but has been described since I wrote my book is the heart brain connection. It turns out that the heart itself has a nervous system and the pericardium which is the fibrous membrane that surrounds the heart there is a network of nerves which have predictive capacities when people say especially for negative things when you say oh I knew it in my heart you did and that brain in the heart whatever happens emotionally and how we live our lives has a huge impact on our physiology because these systems are not separate they are just one system. let's look at the question of how the repression of anger then might suppress our immune system.",

    "text": "what it is it's a it's a build up of tension and an urgent release that it's a way of actually self created it's a way of releasing tension and there's that relief addiction I define as any behavior that you crave that has a sense of relief associated with it and which has negative consequences and you don't give it up despite the negative consequences that's what addiction is bulimia is an addiction the best way to understand it is a form of addiction and the causes of it go back to exactly the same factors that would underlie addiction see there's only one story there's only one story you treat kids they grow up to be healthy adults you don't treat them they're going to act out their unwellness in a number of ways and all the illnesses that we have and all these diagnoses are just different forms of people manifesting early trauma and early distress that's all it's very simple yes I was just taking up on the question about bulimia how do you see anorexia is related do you see that as being addictive or is that more in the suppressing it's let me just formulate it for you anorexia is an attempt to be in control of something and when you don't feel your life is in control that's one way to be in control because that's something nobody can control you with you're going to be totally in charge it's it's an emotional or it's an attempt to deal with severe emotional loss that leaves you completely helpless but in this one area of your life you're totally in charge that's how I understand it and invariably it has to do with relationships with caregivers particularly mothers I don't blame mothers because the mother is just acting out what happened to them as kids but with the kids with anorexia there's always issues and I know that the singer Anne Murray I think her daughter was anorexic and what I read about them it is a self suppression on the part of the daughter I think there's a lot of anger there that's being suppressed in anorexia and that anger is being taken out on the self that's how I understand it there was a hand somewhere else yes please what about what do you think about the idea of somebody getting cancer if they've experienced repeated physical traumas that have been accidental somebody who's had a series of accidents throughout their life that have been potentially less threatening accidents than getting cancer at a very young age and dying from it first of all I would say that nobody has a series of accidents accidentally that for example if you have if you constantly get into accidents I mean statistically it might happen sometimes purely randomly that you always happen to be where the lightning strikes but overall people that are accident prone it doesn't come from the outside there's something about them where they ignore risk or they're unaware of their environment or something and that has to do with early defense mechanisms I'll say more about that in my talk on ADHD which is to say that they're stressed it would not be unusual then for them to get cancer but I don't think it's the physical injury directly that causes the cancer I think it's more the stress and even if I had a physical injury you see if you had a physical injury that's not the stress what the stress is let me ask you this question here some of you may wish to answer if you don't that's perfectly but is anybody here willing to acknowledge and you don't have to there's no pressure here that you were sexually abused as a child if that's true for you just put your hand up very good thank you at the very back how old were you when that happened 4 and for how long about a year and in that year who did you tell about it nobody thank you how old were you when it happened not very long a few weeks a few days even in those few days who did you tell about it nobody that's what the stress is because stress is not just what happens to us it's how we process it what you should have had to been able to do was to scream and yell as soon as anybody touched you the wrong way that's what you should have been able to do too it's just to scream and yell scream and run and ask for help the fact that you didn't is not your fault by the time you were 4 and by the time you were 11 you had already learned that you were alone in the world and that there's nobody there to listen to you it's not that you made a mistake you just simply did what any child would which is to assess the situation unconsciously and you already knew that nobody there was there to support you and there when there's no support there then you can't express how you feel it's that suppression of the feeling and the non-expression of the stress response that actually creates the long term chronic stress even if it's somebody with chronic accidents first of all there's reasons why they had them in the first place and in the second place they may not have had the environment where they could actually talk about their feelings and be listened to and understood and that's what creates the long term stress it's the suppression that's the issue here this is how we do stress and that's what creates the long term stress it's the suppression that's the issue here and that's how we respond without knowing anything about the particular case but this would be a general answer to your question yes now you have to really yell or come to the mic I have two things do you have any suggestions when we work with individuals and we know that they have tools because they use words self-education or they know what is wrong with them but they say why bother I think that's a good question do you have any suggestions on how we can work with them first of all let me ask you a question all of you again I ask with a show of hands how many of you made new year's resolutions this year how many of you made new year's resolutions can I see the hands how many of you still kept them how many of what it takes to have a really good life in terms of nutrition and exercise and emotional balance and all that how many of what it takes how many of you are living it first of all thank you first of all the person you are talking about is not that unique are they are just the rest of us what I would say to that person is what listen to them what are they saying to you they are saying that they are discouraged they are saying that they are discouraged just hear their instead of talking them out of it listen to them you sound really discouraged wonder what that's about for you must feel really hopeless sometimes what even me I know how to live a good life but I don't do it's just very hard really listen to them make sure that they feel validated and understood by you then they can get past it if you try to talk them out of it you can't and again a bit louder please second point is I'm on an immunosuppressive drug now and I kind of think maybe it's time to change my feel I mean I used to be a yes person but I'm wondering when I had trauma about 5 years ago it was a major trauma that happened in our family is that and then this past year is when I started getting this immunosuppressive issue and ulcers on my leg and is that is there a timeline when it finally starts to really affect your body I'll talk to my staff about self care how important it is and I've been doing that myself learning to say no I have to create new boundaries wanting to help people and that made me feel better but then I realized that I wasn't taking care of me is there any suggestions on really on how to take back some of that and become more stronger with yourself that you're not getting stage I am trying to get off these drugs that I'm taking today let me tell you about a friend of mine who lives in Calgary her name is Shannon Duke and Shannon is 48 years old now and when she was 37 she was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer stage 4 meant that the cancer was already in her bones by the time it was diagnosed at that time she had 2 young children aged 1 and 3 and married to a -dressed -to-do businessman she herself was a very high functioning executive for Microsoft in Calgary and then she's diagnosed she had the perfect life, perfect marriage, perfect home of course and then she's diagnosed and healthy, physically fit always ate and then she's diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer and she has a transformation now she gets the best medical advice she can get anywhere in North America and she traveled to New York and elsewhere she got the best medical treatment and with that she was given one year to live because that's the prognosis stage 4 despite the medical treatment chances are you'll be dead in one year now a year ago in February, just a year ago now Shannon traveled to the Napa Valley of California with some of her friends and they celebrated her 10th year survival and her 47th birth and the transformation that she experienced was when she was diagnosed and started paying attention she realized that her life had not been her life because she was sexually abused as a child and her response to the abuse was of course as many children will experience it can't be about the adults, it's about me if this terrible thing happened to me I must be a very bad person I have to be very good to compensate and I have to be a good daughter who doesn't talk about it who doesn't disturb the waters the good employee, the good student, the good wife who doesn't talk about the husband's addiction issues because that would again disturb the waters and when she's diagnosed and she decides she wants to live she says to hell with all this perfection and goodness and she confronts her family over the abuse that she had endured and she confronts her husband and she starts leaving an authentic and she leaves the job by the way and she starts leaving the job by the way wasn't really expressing who she was 11 years later the cancer is still in her bones but it's completely inactive but she knows that if she wants to stay alive she needs to stay authentic that I believe that many of these issues are reversible I'm not promising a cure here to anybody but Shannon really underwent a major self journey and continues every day to work at it and she practices her spiritual ways which she ignored all those years and she pays attention to herself and she keeps clearing this stuff out and she is the picture of health her and I give workshops together sometimes that there's ways to get there but it's a commitment and of course it might threaten the attachment relationships that's always your call I'm curious about any correlation with the endocrine system with a person that is either living with alcohol related birth defects and trauma when we look at what you're presenting here about mind and body connection and the immune system you're speaking about a lot of hormones my question is about if the endocrine system is not developed fully because of alcohol related birth defects I don't know the effect of I'm not expert enough to tell you if there's any correlation between alcohol effects and the hormonal apparatus, the endocrine system I do know that there's a correlation between trauma and the endocrine system that's what I've been talking about but I don't know the specific answer about alcohol, it's a good question I may need to look it up as long as it's finished we've got five minutes rather than take another question let me ask you to take a couple of minutes and answer the following question for yourself in what area of your life are you not saying no I'm talking about where there's a no that wants to be said but you're not saying it those areas are usually work or personal relationships and I suggest you just talk to each other just tell each other at your table or a partner if you don't want to talk, write it but have a conversation with yourself or somebody else at your table about where you're not saying no in your life, that would be a personal relationship or on your job, just have that conversation.",

    "text": "Life is kind of a lot of work and if I'm being completely honest with you guys some days I just don't really feel up to it. Getting up, taking a shower, eating, doing all the things, getting dressed, driving to work. there are days when that just feels much and that's really frustrating because then there's other days where I wake up and I'm I got this today no problem but some days it just feels such a burden to do the basic stuff that I have to do to stay operational for lack of a better term. And that's just the body too. I mean if you get into what our brains need to stay healthy and functional that's a hundred times more complicated and I probably just triggered every physician who watches this channel and they're now gonna unsubscribe. But as a psychologist brains are a giant fiend in the butt to deal with. They're just inconsistent, they're unpredictable, they're illogical. That's the worst part. The is logic literally comes from our brains yet our brains are illogical. Make that make sense to me. In all seriousness sometimes being alive feels more burden than a gift and I hate that I feel that way. I say those words out loud and I hate that I say them because I don't want that to be true because I don't actually believe that is true but I feel that way sometimes and having your thoughts and your feelings on a completely different page of life is a really difficult thing to figure out what to do with. I thankfully don't feel that way nearly as often as I used to and I think for the most part that is because I have discovered and continue to use a series of strategies that makes existence a lot more tolerable for me.",

    "text": "Now these strategies are specifically designed for people who experience things depression, anxiety, or other mood or anxiety disorders because those add some layers of complexity to what it takes to take care of ourselves and that's much of what we talked about on this channel on this podcast is essentially how to take care of yourself as a person living with one or more mental illnesses because it is more important but also more difficult to take excellent care of yourself if you have a chronic mental health condition or multiple chronic mental health conditions. more important being at heart which means we are probably going to need a special set of strategies a different rule book than what most of humanity has to play by in order to kind of make it to the end of the day and make ends meet in order to be single in order to live in a way that we can get up and do it tomorrow the day after and the day after. Before we get into the three strategies I want to define for you today I want to make sure we're clear what it is I am talking about because this is a little bit different than just oh I'm tired oh I'm unmotivated this is I don't completely care to be alive today I'm indifferent to existence now. I'll give you a silly example of this it's not silly it's the subject matter is kind of silly but it's a very serious feeling. One of the biggest I guess I would say fights that I ever got into with my mom and there were more of them than there should have been sorry mom one of the biggest fights I ever got into with my mom was of all things over a parking brake.",

    "text": "We live they still live they kind of live on a hill and once multiple children in the home had vehicles a lot of us had to park on the street which means we were parked on the hill with our cars just pointing downhill and my mom noticed that I didn't set my parking brake and one I think it was breakfast one morning at breakfast she assumed I didn't know how which I don't think I did that's not the point she was giving me instructions on how to set the parking brake and I'm 17 or something in the story. I said something along the lines of mom I don't care. She thought I meant I don't care how to learn the parking brake and she was trying to explain it to me she's not a good student. you have to get the car into a parking brake and then you have to go to the parking brake and then you have to drive to the parking brake on the same day. And she was trying to explain to me, , if you don't set the parking brake, your car might roll down the hill and trash and become not operational. you should care because bad things will happen to you and your belongings if you don't do this thing. And she didn't understand. And I don't blame her because this doesn't make a lot of sense if you never experienced it. She didn't understand what I meant when I said I don't care. I didn't mean I don't care because I don't understand that if I don't do this, I might not have a car. What I meant was I don't care about anything that happens in my life. I don't care if I have a car because pretty much the only things that I use my car for are if I go to work and go to school. I don't care about any of that. I don't care what happens to me. I don't care what my future is. I don't care if this works out or not. , I am not enjoying life and I'm not having a good time.

    "text": "it out I am probably the most likely candidate I need to focus on myself to figure those things out and you're telling me I shouldn't do the only thing that I think might get me out of this and not saying you shouldn't think about yourself I'm not saying you shouldn't care about yourself I'm not saying you shouldn't live in a way that helps you and in fact I absolutely believe you should do all of those things but you shouldn't do only those things and there are many reasons for that perhaps the biggest one is if you have a cyclical mood disorder no matter what you do how hard you try how disciplined you are you are gonna hit times when you don't matter to you that's that's part of depression and that's part of anhedonia is you don't care how good your life is you don't care how much stuff you have you don't care how many people love you because if your ability to emerge is to be able to live in a way that helps you and that's part of the biggest problem is that you don't have the ability to emotionally connect with all of those things outside of yourself and vanish at least temporarily at a moment's notice and you cannot solve this problem by stacking as much of those things as possible those things will help you during a better phase of life when you're feeling relatively good when you're not in the midst of a crippling severe depressive episode they don't think they're great they're wonderful and they give you motivation and they give you joy and they make you want to keep going but what about the times when you can't what about the time the times when throwing all your time and energy only into yourself basically feels you're throwing coins into a black hole rather than a wishing fountain that was a weird metaphor hope you guys know what I mean sometimes inside we just become this black hole and no matter what you put into it nothing good happens it just disappears it just gets sucked into the void and if that's where everything you have is going there's many times when that does nothing for you if that's all you have you're gonna need to expand that what should you expand it to that's not really my business to tell you and that's not me being boy that's me not knowing all the details of your life or who you are as a person but that could be spirituality that could be career that could be a partner that could be children that could be volunteer opportunities it could be pets it could be the environment it could be politics it could be creativity I mean the options are basically endless here and this is just these are super broad ideas that are just scratching the surface but if it's all just staying inside there's gonna be times when you feel completely hollow and empty if you are also investing in things outside of yourself living for more than just you may still not connect with those purposes emotionally during severe depressive episodes you may still not connect with those purposes emotionally during severe depressive episodes you may still not connect with those purposes emotionally during severe depressive episodes but you will at least logically be able to say I know that I'm making some wise choices here I know that some of my resources are being allocated towards something that does matter for some reason I don't know why this is I would love for someone to explain this to me maybe you guys know if you have any theories let me know in the comments some reason it seems our ability to care about and for ourselves is hit much more severely by depression than our ability to care for other things or people I don't know if there's a scientific reason for that but I can have periods of time where I just do not care one single bit about myself but I have never been depressed that I didn't care about my kids for example I don't know why that is and I didn't realize that question was going to enter my mind before I started filming this episode if you guys have any thoughts on that let's make this a little conversation in the comments let me know what you think super curious about that one but again bullet point summary number one find something ideally multiple things because if you if it's just one thing depending on what it is there might be periods of time where it's not available to you but try to have something in this world that matters to you other than just you because when you have a chronic mental health condition you are unpredictable again I don't mean that judgmentally I just mean your inner emotional world is one of turmoil it's one's of all it's one of a lot of ups and downs and it's one that you can't always count on if you have things outside of yourself that you can count on to be more stable or more predictable than your feelings that can be an inference storm to speak something that keeps you grounded keeps you on the track when you're all over the place and I know that I've needed that and I suspect most people who have felt how I felt probably also need that second rule I try to live by that helps me get through these patches when I just don't really care is I have trained myself to operate for an extended period of time in the absence of an emotional reward that is really what's at the core of all three of these is during these periods of time when we get that black hole void empty feeling we have to figure out ways to continue to live and continue to do things when we aren't feeling what we would normally feel under those circumstances we're mammals there's no getting out of that fact mammals are reward based creatures we really only do things for one of two reasons to move towards a desired outcome or to move away from an undesired outcome that those two principles basically explain all of human behavior that's if you look at your day and what you spend time and energy on almost everything is for one of those two reasons and those reasons get very disrupted when the reward part kind of goes bye-bye for a while but it doesn't have to because if you have learned that this is just a thing that happens to me sometimes I just don't feel what I know I should be able to feel from the things that I have from the things that I'm doing from the fill in the blank with whatever matters to you in life it won't disappear forever if we're talking about anhedonia which is what I'm referring to in this episode if you're experiencing anhedonia from a depressive episode it doesn't last forever when you have those empty periods try not to panic try not to flip your entire life upside down try not to stop doing the things that you logically know are beneficial for you to continue doing just because you no longer connect with them emotionally because it will come back these are episodes that occur as a component of an episodic mood disorder and by definition every episode will lift at some point that doesn't mean you'll feel amazing it doesn't mean all your problems will be solved it means you'll feel better at some point in the future it's essentially I'm talking about delayed gratification here because if we can't feel an immediate reward we can predict and trust hard word I know trust is tricky when you're unpredictable internally but if you can trust don't feel this now but I believe that if I keep doing these things I'll get there this feeling will come to me eventually as long as I don't stop as long as I don't stop taking care of myself as long as I don't stop doing the things that I believe are important as long as I don't stop using my tools using my coping skills as long as I don't stop spending time with my loved ones again fill in the blank with whatever your thing is it'll come back unless you stop doing it won't that's what gets us into much trouble I've talked about this in another episode and this is just my phrasing and I'm trying to think of a less judgy way to say it sounds judgy but I legitimately believe that there are two types of depressive episodes there are medical depressive episodes where your internal brain chemistry and physiology shifts and you feel and function differently because of that shift and then there's what I call false depression I don't mean that you're faking it I mean when a depressive episode hits you especially a severe one you often stop doing all the things that make you not feel depressed because if you don't feel any different when you do them it's hard to operate in the absence of reward but if you stop doing those things eventually that depressive episode ends but if you are no longer doing anything that makes you feel good or gives you a sense of meaning or purpose and you're still living a severely depressed person even after the episode has ended you will continue to feel a severely depressed person you will continue to feel a severely depressed person even after the episode is ending.",

    "text": "The difference is it's now not a reflection of your inner biology and neurology. It's a reflection of your actual life that you're living because you're living a depressed person. And if you live a depressed person, even if you don't actually experience depression, you will eventually experience depression. And a lot of the people who tell me , no, I have eternal depression. it does not lift. There's no episodes. It's just always this. This might be the reason. And I say this with all the love, respect, and empathy in the world. Please know that. You've got to shift out of that mode of functioning when you're able to, or it will last forever, but it doesn't have to. Sometimes it's going on and on and on because you weren't doing anything to change how you feel. And I know that it's easier said than done. But if you can train yourself to at least maintain that bare minimum level of functioning, and even when you feel absolutely nothing from it, that will decrease the frequency, the duration, probably even the severity of these episodes. It can flip the ratio upside down. This can be the thing that makes you go from, I am almost always depressed other than when the stars align and I have basically a perfect day to the complete opposite. Almost always. Other than when everything falls apart all at once. We all have those days. I'll have those days. You'll have those days. But if the only times you really get brought down to those depths, are on those days where you just, where it's just all the stuff. It's everything, you guys know what I'm talking about. Everything that could have gone wrong today did. Those days are going to suck. There's nothing you can do about it. But if those are the only days you feel that way, that's a night and day difference. And being able to sustain functioning with delayed gratification is crucial to keeping those ratios around. The third rule I try to live by, and this might sound very similar to the second one. Again, they're all on the same, they're all based on the same foundation. there's some common DNA with all three of these, but I do believe they're worth separating because they kind of land differently, at least in my brain.",

    "text": "The third is do not function on emotion alone. There is a DDT, dialectical behavior therapy concept called wise mind. And it's a Venn diagram. a Venn diagram is just the two circles and then they overlap in the middle,. the two independent circles are reason mind and emotion mind. Person functions on emotional alone. the two independent circles are reason mind and emotion mind. Person functioning on reason mind would use only, , logic and statistics and objective data to make their decisions. That's not necessarily good either. Person living in emotion mind, but was just based on how things feel in the moment. Both of those extremes can lead us astray at times. And a good example is a job. let's say you're picking between two different jobs. you have two job offers. Person, you think reason mind would just be a job. You just look at the salary, the benefits, the hours, the commute, and basically turn this into a math equation, which job is superior numerically. The emotion minded person would go based on, , what vibe did I get while I was there. How did the environment feel. Did I enjoy talking to the coworkers. And isn't going to look at the numbers at all. Both of those approaches can end up putting you in a really tough spot. But wise mind is the area in the middle where they overlap. The tricky thing with depression and anxiety is our emotions often either they go to both extremes. Sometimes our emotions get bigger, stronger, scarier than what most people experience. Sometimes they're gone. sometimes they're just absent completely. It's relatively easy not to make decisions based on emotions when you don't have them, or you might think, but in a weird way, the absence of emotion still kind of is emotion. And I hope this makes sense because it's kind of metaphysical ish. But I think it's a really good way to think about it. But also don't make decisions based on the absence of emotion. extreme example, let's say that you hit a severe depressive episode that includes complete total anhedonia. I don't feel anything good from any stimuli in my life. And let's say, let's say that you're me, you're a 40 year old married man.",
