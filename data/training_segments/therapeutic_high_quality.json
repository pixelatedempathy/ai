    "text": "And I guess to take this one step further, I've heard you talk about that one of the main problems with society today is that a lot of people who have mental health struggles and they're struggling with situations this where they feel stuck and they can't get out of their own way at times. They feel people are against them. They're dealing with trauma. And then they might go see somebody who's not trained in trauma. They don't have the experience. How can somebody begin to take that path and make sure that they're finding somebody that is trained in that and then also that they're able to self-regulate themselves. When needed. , that's a huge question because unfortunately, look, I've been through medical training. I'm a physician. And the average physician never hears any of the stuff I just talked about. The average psychiatrist doesn't get any training in trauma. Not in. They learn something about PTSD, which is a specific form of trauma. But they don't learn about the traumatic basis of depression and anxiety and ADHD. And they learn nothing about it. it's very difficult to find good help within the medical system. Now, many therapists also don't get any such training. There's a lot of therapists that are designed only to change your beliefs and your behaviors, but not to address the fundamental reasons for those behaviors. a lot of psychologists trained in CBT, cognitive behavioral therapy, or dialectical behavioral therapy. A lot of them are not really. And I know this. Believe me, I know this. They just don't know much about or anything about trauma. Then they can't help you with the fundamental wound that you're carrying. They can help you with the manifestations. And that's not useless. But they can't help you heal at your core. then there are therapies that are deeper than that. There is body-based therapies such as somatic experiencing developed by my friend and teacher, Dr. Peter Levine. There's sensory motor psychotherapy developed by Pact Ogden. There's EMDR that works for some people. There's internal family systems. There's a lot of different therapies that are developed by my friend and colleague, Dr. Richard Schwartz. There's compassionate inquiry, which is based on my work. And I train therapists in that method. There are others, other names I could mention.",

These are people who at times can be charming, charismatic, the sex can be good. You'll just be , oh my gosh, this relationship is toxic. And then boom, one of those moments will come. I cannot wait for you to hear this conversation with Dr. Ramani Dharvasala, clinical psychologist, best-selling author, and quite honestly, the internet's most trusted truth teller when it comes to toxic relationships. People shrink to stay in these relationships and basically live their lives in service to appeasing, pleasing, walking on eggshells. It's definitely taking a psychological toll on people. Her book, It's Not You, is a lifeline. And she's giving us the tools that we need to spot narcissistic behavior, shut down gaslighting, and get out with our sanity and our self-worth intact. People say, if you were to say one thing that could hedge against getting too deep into a narcissistic relationship, here's a therapist hack. Let's get into it. Dr. Ramani, I am excited you're here today. Oh, I'm happy to be here, Tamsyn. I really, I love what you're doing for women, with women, and having this conversation. Again, I think maybe 25 years ago, I'd be , oh, whatever. And now, honey, I'm on the perimenopause downslope here. , we've got you, not to worry. We're going to make it an upslope, though. It'll be good. I love it. It'll be good. Your book has just been game-changing and fascinating. And I know. many women have brought it up to me. And I knew I had to have you on this podcast. Thank you. For this reason, though, is because a lot of women in midlife are looking around and saying, what is going on when it comes to my relationships, when it comes to my health, when it comes to my career. And we talked about it a little bit, but I want to dive in because you discuss narcissism in such a way that I don't realize that it goes into many different areas of our lives. I just had no idea. can you define first, what is a narcissist. Just. Just to get down to basics of what is that.",

Being betrayed by the one you've trusted most causes your brain to essentially have to split into two, split into this impossible idea that the person that you have loved and trusted the most and made yourself most vulnerable to is now the person that has harmed you the most, is the person that is least trustworthy. And you're not really sure if you're ever going to feel safe or be able to trust anyone, not just this person, but anyone ever again. And even if the trauma of discovering this particular betrayal, this addiction or infidelity or uncovering some kind of big unknown thing, even if that incident has passed, it has come and gone, and maybe you're in a repair state, the trauma, the betrayal can become imprinted into your body. And it can wreak havoc on everything about your lifestyle, everything about how you show up and operate physically, emotionally. It can show up as unwelcome flashbacks, bursts of anger or sadness that just kind of feel out of nowhere, constant hypervigilance, just this fear and anxiety perseverating around your partner, the betrayal. And much, much more feelings of hopelessness. It can feel an emotional and physical roller coaster that causes actual physical harm to your body. And most importantly, it makes you feel powerless or out of control. you have no agency. You've been thrown on this roller coaster and you don't get to decide when you get off. And it is really important for trauma or betrayal trauma therapists to help you feel you're in a state of hopelessness. And it's really important for trauma therapists to help you unwire that or change that framework in your body, the mentality that I don't get choice here. Trauma recovery is all about returning choice back to you. that's what one of these, that's what polyvagal can help you with. the cause of these post trauma symptoms come from our brains, learning and survival system.",

Use sensory and auditory stimuli, visual auditory stimuli, temperature regulation. warm baths, cold packs. Someone's talking about how they use sauna and cold plunge and it works really for them. It helps really heal or just re-stabilize their nervous system. Self-talk, self-soothing, self-touching. I find this to be helpful. Sometimes people just do this. They hold and hug pillows. Doing the eye, stimulation. There's also the bi-tappers. I'm trying to find my bi-tappers. But they buzz in each hand. Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz. Or listening, auditory stimulation. Those can all be helpful stimulation. Let's see what else. Therapy. Obviously, you can go to a -trained therapist who knows how to use trauma-informed therapy such as EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing, somatic experiencing, internal family systems. And collaboration and supportive approach. Remember, social engagement with safe, non-judgmental people is very, very important to the healing process. try to identify. Don't lock yourself up or isolate yourself. Go out to these betrayed partners groups. Maybe the first one doesn't work. Maybe the second one doesn't work. But you have to find a group of people. I've been really fortunate. All of my groups, I run into people who are really, really, phenomenal men and women who show such strength and courage. I admire them all deeply. And one of my greatest joys is watching them all find each other under such sad, heartbreaking circumstances. But it's incredible to see them support one another, validate each other, and make meaning from this tragedy. And that they've been able to reach out across the country or across the world and share their stories and comfort others who've struggled in a way that they've never been able to. That is healing, in my opinion. And I would really encourage you all to do that. And just I'm going to remind you, look at that menu of self-care options.

Now obviously everybody's different but the effects of abuse and neglect in childhood tend to follow very common patterns, they're common that I think you'll find it comforting really that know a lot of your challenges and mistakes. are not some kind of personal failure and when you learn the common effects of trauma, this is something I teach in all my courses, you're gonna find how many of your problems are normal. You can totally let go of all the blame because it's not your fault and you don't have some kind of crazy preference for drama, you're not seeking out people who hurt you and you're not trying to recreate your childhood. Have you ever been told these things. I mean really the common symptoms of CPTSD from childhood are normal responses to abnormal circumstances during your developmental years, you did not do this to yourself. Yes there are psychological elements and those can in turn into self sabotaging behaviors and I deal with that a lot too in my courses and coaching programs, but at its root CPTSD is a neurological injury that disrupts brain energy. CPTSD is a neurological injury that disrupts brain energy and also disrupts the brain activity. And that's what we call CPTSD, it's a neurological injury that disrupts brain and body systems and then that in turn affects your health, it definitely affects your health, it can cause chronic disease, it can cause learning problems, relationship problems which you've noticed, financial problems, depression, anxiety, addiction and this is a big one that gets overlooked for example, it can make it impossible to make clear-headed decisions when you need to make a clear-headed decision when you're stressed. Now there's a lot of wrong information out there, you see it on tv it just drives me crazy in movies and tv a traumatized person finally just talks about it to some therapist or friend and just because they talked about it everything magically goes away and they're better and I just I wish it were that easy and it's a little different than that but of course it looks it should work from the outside, it looks we just aren't seeing that we're traumatized or we're just not getting something.",

    "text": "If you're going to heal from the effects of trauma in your childhood, you're going to be entering a battle between good and evil. And I'm not saying that as a metaphor for anything else. I mean it literally. I am someone who in my life, I've at times felt the presence of evil. And I felt it in places, I felt it around certain people, and I felt exposed to it in dreams. Really, really bad dreams, starting when I was a kid. Dreams that, , shook me. And without a doubt, evil is involved when a parent abuses a child, or neglects them, or when people are bullied, or when someone intentionally harms or destroys another person. Would you agree that's evil. Because the definition of evil matches. Now according to Merriam-Webster, the word evil describes a person who is pro-evil, profoundly immoral and wicked. They cause harm. They are marked by misfortune. That sounds abuse and neglect of children to me. Now as a noun, the dictionary says evil is the fact of suffering, of misfortune, and wrongdoing. Evil is something that brings sorrow, distress, calamity. And very significantly, especially in terms of how I see evil, it is considered a cosmic force. Now I call it the nefarious force, because I just noticed that evil seems to have a life of its own. It's widespread. You can't ever stamp it out entirely. When you try, it comes back a weed. And in particular, evil is contagious. Now once you get hurt by an evil action, it can function a seed that sprouts later in your life. And this is, I believe, this is why we have generational trauma. A parent harms a kid, the kid suffers, but later that little tiny seed starts to grow and the kid grows up potentially to harm more people, including their own kids. Trauma can generate illness and depression, addiction, a loss of mental clarity, a loss of mental health, financial failure, damaged relationships. Trauma is a very destructive thing. And unfortunately, if trauma isn't healed, it is very likely to cause trauma. Trauma is a very destructive thing.

    "text": "There's a core symptom of trauma that most people don't know about. It's very strong and it can be very limiting for your life. It's not only associated with trauma, but it's almost universal in people who are traumatized as children. And it drives virtually every other trauma symptom. Meaning, until you've learned to identify and heal it, it's hard to change the other symptoms. And yet, you may never have heard of this. It's called neurological dysregulation. And when about it, the possibility of healing and changing your life go way up. Not knowing about it is a big reason why people who grew up with neglect and abuse struggle to progress in their healing. Now this is because what everyone used to believe is that trauma wounds were largely psychological. The problem was emotional, behavioral, maybe cultural. And trauma wounds are definitely partly traumatized. And we all know that trauma wounds are usually caused by a lack of physical activity. But we now know that the primary injury is neurological. That means it's in your nervous system. how does that work. Early trauma dysregulates the brain and nervous system, potentially triggering a whole range of problems. From obesity to ADHD to heart disease to addiction. And those are problems that could happen to anyone, but they're much more common in traumatized people. It's more than that. For people with childhood PTSD, just being dysregulated is a problem. And it makes ordinary things in your life ridiculously hard. Things reading a book, spending time alone, getting somewhere on time, expressing an opinion, or dealing with feeling left out. All these things can set off dysregulation. If you could see an MRI image of a brain in this dysregulated state, you'd see the front left cortex. Go dim and inactive. And that hampers the ability to reason and pay attention. You'd see the front cortex flaring wildly. And that's a flood of emotions. you have suppressed reasoning, overreactive emotions, and then it gets hard to process emotions and thoughts. what happens is you start to feel overwhelmed. It is just building up in there. Do you ever experience that. It's not just an emotional reaction, it turns out. It's in your brain. there's this change of activity. Brain waves are irregular. Breathing and heart rate become irregular and out of sync. And there may be numbness in your hands.",

    "text": "Hey everybody. My name's Dr. Scott Giacomucci. I'm the director and founder of the Phoenix Center for Experiential Trauma Therapy and Media, Pennsylvania. Today, I wanted to highlight the American Psychological Association's new guidelines for treating complex PTSD and complex trauma. I was really excited to see that these guidelines were created and posted just a couple of months ago at this point in August, 2024, and that they really validate and emphasize that the treatment and recovery of complex trauma and complex PTSD is uniquely different than the treatment and recovery for regular PTSD. if you're a professional that works with complex trauma, these new APA guidelines are really important. They're not just a must know. They finally reflect the complexity of what many of our clients have lived through and are experiencing related to complex post-traumatic stress disorder. these guidelines were created by one of APA's divisions, along with the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation. And these are professional practice guidelines. They're not just, it's not just a publication explaining a diagnosis, but helping us better understand. What complex trauma is. But these are actually guidelines to guide us in best practices for treating complex trauma and complex PTSD in and across the entire treatment continuum, every level of care and across all treatment modalities. with these best practice standards for complex PTSD and complex trauma, the goal is really to move beyond checklists of symptoms or symptom reduction towards a more contextual, relational, and person-centered care. in talking about guidelines for complex PTSD and complex trauma, we first need to consider the differences. PTSD involves four main symptom clusters, which I cover in detail in other videos. But as a quick refresher, we've got the intrusions and re-experiencing the nightmares and the flashbacks. We've got the arousal and reactivity, the hypervigilance, the hyperarousal, the difficulty concentrating, the irritability. We've got avoidance and numbing, dissociation. We've got negative beliefs and negative moods, distorted beliefs about ourselves, about others, and feeling we're stuck in one emotion all the time. these are the four symptom clusters of PTSD. On top of that, we've got three symptom clusters for complex PTSD, and these are a difficulty with emotional regulation, feeling overwhelmed or emotionally shut down, difficulty with relationships, really feeling we want to be close to people, but we don't feel safe in relationships.",

    "text": "We feel distant from others. And a negative self-concept, feeling who we are is a failure or worthless. these are the three add-on symptom clusters for complex PTSD. And these best practice guidelines really orient around these three add-on symptom clusters for CPTSD in that, I talk about in another video. These three add-on symptom clusters can really interfere with one's ability to engage in traditional treatment and especially traditional trauma treatments because they make it hard for clients to be in a therapeutic relationship or be in a group setting. They make it harder for an individual to manage their emotions when talking about trauma, and they make it harder for an individual to make sense of their experience when they have a really distorted negative self-concept. And these are the three add-on symptoms for CPTSD. complex trauma is different than other types of trauma in that it's complex. It's chronic. It's repeated. It happens again and again and again and again. It's often interpersonal or relational. And many times the trauma is intentional. Complex trauma often happens at the hands of another adult, a human that intentionally engages in violence or manipulation or abuse. Whereas many other types of trauma are actually intentional. a natural disaster or a car crash. These things are accidents. And there's a different way we experience harm when it's accidental than when it's at the hands of someone that was intentionally trying to hurt us. Especially when that person is someone who was a family member or a caregiver whose job inherently was to nurture and protect us. Complex trauma is also different than other types of trauma in the timing of it, in that it's developmentally. It happens early on in our lives most of the time. And it often can be transgenerational or systemic in that it's trauma that gets passed down from generation to generation. That it's built within the system of a family or within larger systems of oppression. complex trauma is uniquely different than other types of trauma in these specific ways. And complex PTSD, which results from complex trauma, is often missed or misdiagnosed at the end of the day. And it's often seen as other things borderline personality disorder or depression or anxiety or other personality disorders or mood disorders or ADHD. Or sometimes it's just labeled as treatment resistant.",

The sixth area of the six guideline APA articulates for treating CPTSD and complex trauma is that it's got to be relational, that the therapeutic relationship is often the core avenue that healing is experienced when it comes to trauma therapy, that many trauma survivors never had a safe or attuned relationship in their life, someone that protected them or nurtured them or cared about them without taking advantage of them. And the therapeutic relationship has got to be really core to our treatment for complex trauma and relational trauma, that therapy is a chance for clients to rebuild a sense of trust, to repair any relational ruptures, to model healthy boundaries and vulnerability and safety, and connection. This means that as therapists, we've got to be really careful about trauma reenactments in the therapeutic relationship and the presence of transference and counter transference. We've got to really handle these with care and with ethical clarity. And this really highlights the importance of group therapy, I would argue, that relationships can be even more centered in a group therapy approach than in individual therapy. And the seventh key guideline for treating CPTSD is that it's a challenge for the therapist to be able to handle the trauma reenactment. And the key guideline for treating complex trauma and complex PTSD outlined by APA is the why. Why did the trauma happen. Why me. Why did nobody help. it's really exploring all of the whys, exploring meaning making and the questions, the confusion, the more existential experience that accompanies trauma and accompanies PTSD, helping clients reframe a sense of self-blame for maybe transforming it into a sense of accountability.",

    "text": "And I think that's a really important piece of the book is really understanding that the trauma is a result of the client's responsibility for the perpetrator and the client's accountability for the perpetrator or renegotiating their sense of moral injury into a sense of moral repair or, or strong sense of moral character or moral values, or transforming a sense of hopelessness or helplessness into a sense of empowerment or autonomy, essentially helping the client transform posttraumatic stress into post-traumatic growth. That within our treatment approaches for trauma, there's gotta be a space for exploring the spiritual and emotional parts of the trauma that we're dealing with and the emotional the spiritual and existential domains of experience. those are the seven key guidelines APA articulates for treating complex trauma and complex PTSD in their new guidelines that were published at the end of 2024. Now, there's some additional considerations that are outlined in the guidelines, one of which is about equity and inclusion. And APA highlights that trauma really intersects with race and gender and class and disability and other forms of systemic oppression, and that many experiences of racism or oppression or discrimination are experiences of complex trauma. That just reoccurring experiences of abuse is complex trauma, reoccurring experiences of racism or discrimination is also complex trauma. And we've got to take this into consideration throughout our treatment. Now, we also have to be really thoughtful about self-care. As a therapist working with complex trauma and complex PTSD, we're more prone to experiencing vicarious trauma. And this means for anyone working with complex trauma, that supervision, peer support, training, self-care become that much more important. And a third consideration outlined by APA is the importance of training. That just because we get a master's degree or a license to provide therapy doesn't mean that we're not going to be able to do it. , I think that's a really important point. That just because we get a master's degree or a license to provide therapy doesn't mean that we're equipped to competently, ethically, and safely treat trauma and complex PTSD. That treating C-PTSD really requires specialized training and specialized approaches to trauma and dissociation and moral injury. And that it's important that we engage in thorough training and ongoing training. , these are the cliff notes, the key aspects of the new treatment guidelines for treating C-PTSD.",

    "text": "But in my view, that's a great point. And that's the essence of the book, Framing, and I think that betrayal blindness may be basically an element of every single narcissistic relationship. Framing. not. And I think that blindness to me fits this because a narcissistic relationship is a relationship with somebody whose personality organization is such that they cannot be in a healthy, balanced, equitable relationship. And they are going to betray to get their needs met,. using that as a framework, do you think betrayal blindness is what would make somebody vulnerable to getting stuck in a relationship characterized by these dynamics of gaslighting, manipulation, invalidation, chronic lying, could be cheating, could be financial abuse. Do you think that is then connected to people either staying in these relationships or getting sucked back in even when they try to step away from them. Yes, I do. And if I'm correct, then helping people not respond with betrayal blindness will help them not stay in such relationships and protect themselves and have healthy boundaries that they're not being mistreated in this way. And I think one of the things you're saying that I think is really important is that abuse can occur in the emotional and psychological sphere. And it's easier for us to identify abuse when it's physical or sexual. But for emotional and psychological abuse, which are powerful, in some ways, at the heart of all abuse, are not always as easy to identify and to label and to know. And part of that is the way we're taught. And , we don't necessarily have those skills. But part of it is that emotional and psychological abuse really occurs over time in a relationship context. It's not usually in the moment, whereas, , physical and sexual abuse, there is no time for that. And I think that's a really important part of the question. There is in the moment sense of it. But everybody can have a bad , if you're in a long term relationship with somebody, you're going to say something harmful. Sometimes, I mean, that's human. what makes it abusive is this pattern over time. And I think that's just harder to recognize. And , I think it's harder for people to say this is abusive to understand it's abusive, whether you're the victim, or even watching a relationship.",

I think that in narcissistically abusive relationships to from the world at large, you said, these are long term relationships. And I'm really glad you made that distinction. Because I think what happens is that there's a real risk of , everybody has a bad day, , it's not that big a deal. This isn't about a bad day. These are bad lifetimes. these are 30, 40, 50, 50, or marriages. These are relationships that have been characterized by this kind of emotional and psychological hijacking since pretty much infancy. this is the only reality that this person really, really knows. But the pushback from the world, and honestly, even I think the psychological community is sometimes , oh, that's just someone who's a jerk. It's a larger scale, psychological issue that is actually doing significant harm to an individual. going back then, to betrayal blindness, is that I want to connect it to a really common phenomenon we see in survivors is that people in these relationships blame themselves. This has got to be me, I've got to be doing something wrong. How do you see betrayal blindness connecting to the self blame we see that people experience when they're in emotionally abusive relationships. , I think they're quite connected. And another sort of related concept here, I think is shame. If you can take some or even all of the blame of what's not working onto yourself, it actually supports the betrayal blindness,. Because you are no longer going to see the other person as responsible. you're not going to see that they're betraying you. And, , one way people take on the blame is through the emotion of shame, where they get mistreated by somebody else, and then they feel shamed. And that shame has sort of implicit in it that there's something I've done or could do differently to have prevented or in the future prevent this mistreatment. And therefore, it's not the fault of the person who's doing it. It's something about me. And therefore, I can stay in relationship with this person, because I'm the one who's the problem. it's part of that very dynamic of betrayal blindness,.",

    "text": "And that what's not happening though, Dr. Freyd, is that there is not this secondary attention to the toll it's taking on the person who remains in the relationship. The focus becomes heavily on the attachment, on the status quo, on not rocking the boat, that what's getting missed is that inherent harm that is just happening under the radar and often then contributing to anxiety, mood symptoms depression, helplessness, hopelessness, powerlessness, confusion, self-blame, self-doubt. the person is psychologically getting destabilized and there's almost a false sense of safety. Status quo remains, but I'm falling apart. And that to wit is the struggle of every survivor of narcissism. And that's why I think that the most important thing is to maintain the status quo and not just to be a victim of narcissistic abuse. Maintain the status quo as I psychologically erode. You put that. And I think what's a really important factor there is what happens if they don't maintain the status quo. And that then is partly on the rest of us,. It's what happens depends on the social context the person finds themselves in. It's what happens if they don't maintain the status quo. And that's where it comes down to the safety net. And that's where it's at. And that's where it's at. And that's where it's at. And I think that the risk of losing the boat on that relationship means they lose everything, truly. They lose their home. They lose all their other relationships. That's an untenable risk. But if they're in a situation where there's a safety net out there, there's going to be people that say, here, come stay at my house. Or here's something for you. We will hold you through this period. And then, , we'll say, , here's what we're going to do next, and we'll say, , this is what we're going to do next. And then that's where the safety net comes down. And that's where the risk of losing the boat comes down, because the safety net is higher than the cost and risk of leaving. But which way that equation works out depends on this larger context a person is in. Absolutely. Have you looked at betrayal blindness as sort of a cultural phenomenon as.",

    "text": ", we often think , , there may be innuendo, there may be suspicion, but this was really happening in her face. One of the pieces that struck me about Julie's story was also that she went on into another relationship where this kind of betrayal happened again. I mean, betrayal blindness is a mechanism that stays within us. when it does happen again, it will, we're likely to experience it again and repeat this in relational cycles. In her case though, and this is where it really coalesces with what we know about narcissistic abuse, Dr. Frey, is this idea that as she became more autonomous, she actually came into her own as an attorney. She cultivated sources of support that actually was the path to healing and growth for her, which is exactly what we tell survivors of narcissistic abuse. And it makes sense that once somebody has, used betrayal blindness to survive a situation, they'd be vulnerable to it again, because there's an ability to detect betrayal that develops, , in childhood, when the child's in a situation in a context where they're allowed to develop that. And it's a very healthy ability. It lets the child know when the person that they're interacting with is safe or not safe. But if you have to suppress that to preserve a relationship, when you meet somebody new, and they are, they're not safe, they're a betrayer, you don't have the same ability as a person who's been allowed to freely develop it. one of the things that, , happens when people heal is to redevelop that skill, to learn how to make good decisions about who to trust, how to hone in on the red flags and to know when it's time to leave a relationship. , I, I often call it the privilege of not having healing. I mean, I've never even had a betraying childhood because it is a privilege. If you have a childhood that is not emotionally abusive, it's a privilege that cuts across anyone, even if they're unprivileged or underprivileged in other areas, it's a huge privilege because it allows you to maintain that critical intuition that you can take into adult relations. blessed are those who are not betrayed because they really, really do get to hold on to something , important.",

    "text": "Estrogen and progesterone interact with dopamine and other neurotransmitters implicated in ADHD. Hormonal shifts across menstrual cycles, pregnancy and menopause can worsen ADHD symptoms, particularly emotional ability. Many women report greater ADHD related emotional challenges during PMS, postpartum and perimenopause. Again, much of this is true even for women without ADHD. Hormones can be a real drag sometimes. You can stop the emotions from coming, but you can learn to ride the wave. I'm going to make a lot of broad statements about the types of treatments that are effective here and leave you with a couple of strategies that you can use on your own. When we look at research and what treatments have broad evidence support for helping with ADHD and emotional regulation, the number one is cognitive behavioral therapy or CBT. CBT is one of the most established treatments for emotional dysregulation and ADHD. It helps individuals to identify and challenge unhelpful thought patterns that often drive emotional overreactions. CBT improves both ADHD's core symptoms and emotional regulation, especially in adults. Number two is dialectical behavior therapy or DBT. Though originally developed for borderline personality disorder, DBT has been adapted for ADHD, especially for managing intense emotions. There are lots of core DBT skills that help. The first is distress tolerance, which is basically how to cope when you're in a crisis or you're triggered. Also in DBT, there's an entire module called emotional regulation, which is all about learning how to identify emotions, increase positive emotions, and reduce unwanted emotions. There's also a module on mindfulness, and I'll say more about the benefits of mindfulness in a second. Lastly, interpersonal effectiveness. there are skills around assertiveness, boundary setting, ways to communicate to improve relationships, or also resolve conflict. DBT based interventions have been shown to significantly reduce emotional dysregulation in adolescents and adults with ADHD. At my practice, we have a full fidelity, comprehensive DBT program and provide a variety of CBT treatments, all virtual. Our DBT classes are available in 43 states. We take some insurances, and we have a sliding scale as low as 25. You can visit our website at kindmindpsych. com to reach out or for more information. Number three are mindfulness based interventions. Some of the known benefits of mindfulness are improved attention to internal states, decreased emotional reactivity, and increased psychological flexibility.",

When they do that, then a lot of times they start telling themselves these dysfunctional thoughts that have to do with control, such as, I must need to try harder to make this work, or it's my fault that this is not working. And those thinking styles start to become more and more extreme as the dysfunctional other's behavior becomes more and more extreme. When the dysfunctional relationship occurs in childhood, it prevents the child from developing secure attachment, there's a treatment target, safety in their own skin as in their house, self-awareness and self-esteem, emotional awareness and emotion management skills, boundaries and communication skills. understanding the, the symptoms, how they could have developed to help a child or a person survive a very chaotic dysfunctional relationship, and then identifying alternative ways to help them cope with life in the present is essentially what we're talking about in the recovery process for codependency.",

They're not sleeping. They're not eating. Because of the stress, their immune system is often out of whack. They have high levels of cortisol, which ends up throwing them the immune system out of whack. It can trigger autoimmune issues. It triggers pain. There's a lot of physiological stuff that happens when people are under constant or chronic stress. Affectively, people who are codependent often have emotions that are all over the place. They have this underlying current of anxiety that they're going to be abandoned. But they're not going to be abandoned. They're going to be in a state of mental health. They're going to be in a state of mental health that is punctuated by bursts of anger when the person doesn't do what they're supposed to do. Or depression, when they feel they can't control the other person. They can't fix it. They feel helpless. There's very rarely time for feelings of happiness and contentment and those things that we want to feel. Cognitively, the person with codependency, because they are in this negative mood state, often, because they are not sleeping , which impairs our cognitive functioning in and of itself, they often probably have difficulty with problem solving. And they tend to focus, and this is what our brain does when we're in a negative mood state, we tend to focus on the threats in the environment and interpret things in a negative light. we see the glass as half empty. If somebody does something, we see the, or we expect the most nefarious interpretation of it as opposed to the most benign. And interpersonally, when people are in codependent relationships, there's almost always a power struggle between them and the person that they are rescuing, but it also impairs other relationships because their friends, their family, may be able to see how unhealthy this person is. that's one of the things that we see in the relationship, that they can't see how healthy this relationship is. But the person who is, who's codependent is afraid to let it go, doesn't trust these other people. they end up pushing others away because they're trying to maintain this relationship as maintain the facade that everything's perfect.",

Until they can provide self-validation and self-comfort, all relationships can potentially become codependent. People with codependency issues generally get in relationships with others who need to be rescued. They don't feel worthy or lovable for themselves because they were harshly criticized or neglected and ignored often as children, not always, but often this starts in childhood. And as a result, they need somebody to validate them. helping them repair that broken attachment method is going to be a huge step towards helping them start forming healthy, non-codependent relationships. Recovery involves developing a sense of self-worth, identifying the function of the behaviors, addressing the depression, guilt, resentment, and anxiety, and what triggers those things, and then developing skills to deal with those feelings, and learning about and creating a network of healthy relationships.

    "text": "Have you ever wondered if there's a quick and reliable way to check if someone's a narcissist. Whether it's a boss, a co-worker, someone you've just met, or someone you've cared about for years. When you're dealing with a narcissist, the goal is to spot them early and repel them fast. That one move can save you years of stress, manipulation, and emotional abuse. If you're empathetic, giving, and care deeply about people, this test is crucial because you're exactly the kind of person they're looking for. I've spent the last 20 years researching the connection between self-worth and narcissistic relationships. As a coach, author, and someone who's lived it, I know how much damage they can do. In this video, I'll share a simple behavioral test you can use anytime, anywhere, plus real-life examples and strategies to protect yourself in any situation. let's start with what drives their behavior. Narcissists don't show up with a warning label. They show up with charm, or confidence, or with a crisis that pulls you in. Imagine you're at a dinner party, a work event, or a family function. You might be looking for connection, hoping to feel seen, or safe, or included. You might feel a little unsure of yourself or drawn to the person who seems easygoing and magnetic. Now, flip the lens. The narcissist isn't looking for any of that. They're on the hunt. They walk into that same room, scanning the crowd with one thing on their mind. Who will give me what I want, and how quickly can I get it. What they want is to be seen. They are cider-maker- But man, are youê³ sy are you se dis society are you every person is a potential source. They're not resting, they're not connecting, they're watching for openings, small signs that you'll hand over your time, your attention, or your energy. And they'll find out fast by pressing on one of three specific boundaries, because to them, these aren't yours. They're resources and you're just the delivery system. For our purposes here, let's think of boundaries in a super, super simple way. A boundary is something that you can draw a line around, something that you own, a fence around your yard. Inside the fence is yours, and outside the fence is not yours.",

    "text": "But confusing awareness for actual healing might look having major epiphanies about your family or your family life or your parents or your abuse and something gets unlocked. It's actually pretty cool. Reading self-help books that feel they're. Telling your story and you finally feel you've got a name or a grasp on why your family is that and why you're that or why you have messy reactions or issues. Another is researching and having a near PhD level in personality disorders for having spent years online in the thick of that world. Another is the awareness thing is social media posts that become really near and dear to you because you finally got the answer for why you might do things. , but now what though. After you see those posts sharing ideas is actually just a tiny, tiny portion of what therapy actually is. awareness is actually incredible. It can clear up confusion. It can make you feel you're part of a movement of survivors. It can bring immense relief to you. But the pitfall here is walking away with all that knowledge, thinking it's all you need when we really need a lot more. We need someone to witness our grief. We need someone to. Witness our rage or hear our story out or help us not behave from a place of trauma responses. Actually, the healing of being able to tell your story in front of a safe person who can take it all in childhood trauma is really relational abuse that requires relational healing. I know that's not going to feel good for many of you. A really tricky part to this pitfall is that as childhood trauma survivors, we can be highly independent and we grew up in a vacuum where it was. It's all on us. it can feel good to just try to do your own research and get all your answers that way. , you're probably a million times better off, but the psycho education or ideas probably won't make you trigger free or maybe even a better partner, the partner that you want to be, or to stop your inner child from running your life from a place of trauma. The pitfall here is that I see people believing that because say, for example, they fully understand their toxic family or how trauma is stored in the body.",

    "text": "Maybe the responsibility for the need for psychological therapy, perhaps we all feel the frustration of knowing we need to have a surgery and all that's being done is talking about how the wound got there or the effects of the wound or that the wound, regardless of how much we talk about it and diagnosis or whatever we still need surgery. I want to kind of leave you with that on that one. Moving on to number two, is this concept that the abuse won't affect me anymore as a pitfall in therapy. had this going on, but many of them did. One client I remember, years, lovely client, years into therapy, they joked with me how in a kind of confession that they said the reason why they came into therapy is to see if they can work on themselves in order to better handle their mom, better handle their mother. Their mother was an abusive, toxic nightmare. And sometimes our inner child can have strong fantasies about things not affecting them anymore. That's not really a new fantasy. I think that's old from childhood. when we start healing or working on ourselves, we might think we can go back into the fold with abusive people and not be affected after we do a bunch of work. There is a paradox with this one. The more healing that we do, it's actually the less we should be able to tolerate abuse because we're now healthier. It hits us on a deeper level. That weekend with your family, if they're toxic or abusive, might be intolerable to you after you start to unpack and work on something. You're becoming more real and more in your body, it hits harder, I think. You can be less affected, less triggered after a lot of time in therapy, but family toxicity usually doesn't change unless they're working on themselves, which is highly unlikely,. Also, I think after a lot of significant healing work is done, you're way less interested into making yourself the sacrificial lamb and spending a week with your family just because. Where I think after a lot of healing, we're , what. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

I can get my adult in place about it. , if you've heard the term newly sober, this applies. It refers to someone who's been sober for a long time. I know this in context of being an AA or 12-star work, being relieved and inspired about not drinking that they're full-on, a thousand percent dedicated. It becomes their whole life, and they want to tell you about it. Boy, do they want to tell you about it. They might be a little intoxicated on a little bit of healing on the program. They might get a little bit preachy about it being the only way. That's the cringe part. It harkens back to this old thing called the idea of being a little sober, and that's the thing that's important. , when we start therapy, and if you're wired to get a lot out of it, where you're inspired by it, you might want to even become a therapist, which is a beautiful thing. I'm not trying to take that too far. I would encourage a therapist to be a little sober or a collective or even a surrogate healthy family for the first time.

What isn't good about this pitfall is that it usually doesn't work out to try to inspire people to work on their own childhood trauma.

But I generally think of it as taking action towards reducing pain, anxiety, depression, beliefs, stuck places, examining therapy roles, taking action on reclaiming a sense of self, sense of identity, reclaiming the ability to be intimate with others in various ways. And I love this one about having some mastery over our triggers or having things not be such a trigger anymore and taking on kind of a least, not such a grim outlook on life. Not saying super positive, but not dark. And it would be nice to have peace, to know that your abusers were wrong about you is another part to this.

    "text": "as a parent and a clinician and actually a former child care worker, in my private practice, I kept noticing similarities in my adult clients who went through childhood trauma really get stuck in very normal developmental stages that children are going through and sort of in terms of milestones. And , if those kids are actually sort of safe with healthy parents and they're assisted to go through those changes. And what that looks is for adult childhood trauma survivors tend to really struggle compared to certain milestones in our adult lives with that of our peers, that they don't seem to struggle with things as much as maybe we do. And I think that everyone has issues in some ways, but some more than others, especially if they were raised in neglect and abusive parenting. There are just basic things that usually got skipped and missed in a childhood trauma survivor's life that they may need to overcome later on. And I think that's a really good way to look at it. And when we do not grow up in safety with healthy parents who are focused on our development in a good enough way, we get stuck and stop developing until something shifts in our hearing work later on. Many survivors, including myself, had felt really behind compared with our peers in terms of things career, relationships, functioning, basic functioning, self-care. And I personally felt that in my own life all the way from first grade through college. I just did not feel I got the handbook in life. And noticing these differences with our peers can really make us want to hide or overly compensate in our adult lives or feel really lonely in seeing the differences with our peers. And it's really important for you to not go to that shame place when we're discussing this stuff and looking at that stuff or in general. I liken developmental delays if you've ever started a new job where management just expects you to perform flawlessly without giving you any training or a process of learning the ropes. you're just thrown to the wolves. that could have been our childhood. And that's really about management's failure, not yours. Same with being neglected growing up, which is a form of abuse.",

Believing that there was a special bond or a fantasy with their partner which doesn't match the reality of what it is. that's not real intimacy. And some survivors have a parent who actually lived in fantasies with an abusive co-parent, if you can think of that. Another example is struggling with going too fast in dating life, which can really create problems. The delay is that children don't a process of getting to know someone slowly and they want things to be more immediate. Another is not liking to mix partners with friends for fear of losing the partner, an insecurity thing. we didn't have full access to say the caregiver that we were attached to, you can see the security issue and projection of childhood trauma stuff happening in the present from an insecure place. Another example is not caring if our partners are actually abusive for fear of being wrong, or being in a relationship we're not a good match for. I mean maybe we stay out of fear of being alone. It's another example of the codependency delay here. Another example is a level of need from our partners that goes beyond appropriate partnership stuff. And again, this is strongly related to the next issue of security where the delay here is not really being secure to ourselves. Another is taking normative bumps in the relationship as extreme evidence that you're not safe. The delay going on here is that this all or nothing kind of thinking that children can often go to. It's , I'm never talking to you again kind of stuff. That one is tricky because sometimes we actually are in an abusive relationship and we'll need some outside help kind of figuring that out. We really don't it if someone is trying to tell us to just chill, especially if we're in the middle of a big trigger. To get unstuck in this developmental delay, survivors can actively educate themselves on codependency and work a program of recovery around it, such as with Al-Anon or CODA. And doing some inner child based work is highly beneficial. It's also very powerful to do inner child based work. I think that's one of the things that we're really looking at in our work.",

And it's hard to admit that we don't really know how to write a check, or we get anxious around writing a check, or that we can't ask for directions, which is also a security thing. But if we hold our neglectful parents accountable, we can sidestep a lot of that shame, because the accountability is definitely warranted. And sidestepping that shame helps us to be able to learn things on a deeper level. We really can't learn things if we're overwhelmed with shame. Working with our inner child on the functioning delay is really letting them know that they didn't get what they wanted. And that's what I mean by resources. They didn't get what they needed growing up to be successful. And to help them with that level of shame, as your inner adult actually working on the functioning piece, which is where the resources come in. I would recommend starting small on something before tackling bigger stuff, smaller functioning stuff. Reminding yourself that, of course, you struggle with these things due to what happened to you growing up is going to, again, help combat that shame. Last one here is negative coping strategies delay. While it might be hard to see addictive behaviors as developmental delays, I see them as really closely related. As children growing up in abuse, we often found things before and after puberty that would help us to address pain. As adults, we can be developmentally stuck in needing to be soothed from behaviors. Instead of having internal resources to manage them, we should be getting that from a healthy system. Here are some examples. A teen can find that looking physically perfect or attractive as a way to deal with their own mental health is a very difficult thing to do. , if you're a teen, you can find that eating is a way to help them feel and battle insecurity. A teen can also find drugs and alcohol I did to manage some horrific stuff going on at their home life or in their parental relationships. A child can discover that eating is always a good way to distract from their emotions. This is all not really conscious at the same time, too, when it's going on.",

If it's substances, you'll need a specific addiction resource that works for you. If it's workaholism, same thing. the others, getting out of these delays are kind of twofold. Finding the resources about the thing you soothe with, as the piece of working with the inner child about discussing where it comes from and what can be offered to your inner child to replace what the inner child came up with. Remember that branch analogy from earlier. And if you're curious about how to reparent the inner child, you can look at the book, The Reborn of the Inner Child, which is a course available that I'll put in the video description of this video. I reference it. Inner child work is something very specific that I do on paper between your non-dominant hand and your dominant hand. lots of good inner child parenting can be done around this stuff. And again, access to therapy with someone supportive is ideal. And I know that there's a whole bunch of barriers to that, which we all know about. some final thoughts. Try to avoid seeing these delays as forever stuck places. These are fixable over time with some help. And I think good enough healing brings maturing and catching up in good enough ways. Also, try not to see this as a shameful immaturity that happens, but instead as places where we often get stuck and when we don't grow up in a developmentally safe household or environment or have safe relationships with caregivers. Here are some not really connected thoughts here. A toxic family loves to point out your functioning delays while not understanding that they cause them. When you think about the parenting and the caregiving, you're not really thinking about neglect. In other words, we can often be kind of entertainment for the toxic family about our anxiety about writing a check and all that stuff. If ,. you can also become stunted when the family indirectly says that this is the best it's ever going to get. get used to it because of what they modeled.",

Allow for more process. Such as getting better at something over time, which doesn't exist in a toxic family. In the five delays that I discussed here, our family can indirectly say that you're on your own, sink or swim. You either got it or you don't. There's no process in any of that. The ability to get good at something and have some mastery over something. Getting ready to give up a negative coping strategy or to move on to another level of living is a process that one gradually becomes prepared for, whether that's quitting smoking, or getting into therapy. It's a process of moving towards something development. The childhood development that got stunted due to the abuse is moving towards something that is more significant, that is kind of exciting, a new level of achieving or a new level of maturity. Healthy parents are working to help their child function and navigate life, not struggle through it without having a sense of the handbook that other people seem to have gotten.

I'll put it in there. another example is being raised in interpersonal abuse with a narcissistic parent. If you're a parent and you are a narcissistic or mentally off parent who used your lovability and your worth or your value as a weapon and this is intense emotional abuse. Another example is being forgotten about because of say your gender or your needs or that you were sensitive or that a sibling was more valuable than you were to your parents in some awful way. here are some potential healing ideas and specific interventions about self-worth. notice that the issues here involve things lovability, value, and worth. These are the issues that we're going to talk about today. These interventions are conceptually broad and they're not tips or they're not hacks. They're really healing concepts. Healing this stuff is going to be process oriented as deeply emotional and grief oriented and cerebral interventions or tips quick therapies quick ideas those things just stay cerebral. The first intervention about self-worth is what I call holding childhood trauma perpetrators accountable. This is the concept of shifting shame and blame about our poor self-worth on the side of the self-worth that we're garden our love ones are not hurt Wholeheartedly if he res Kazuya 18 repeatedly never time or glory is if you who historically if you've lived advocates and icons and much-needed fallen apart try to avoid Psychopathy e norming temporary it's always kind question. But kind eager to acknowledge that love to the parents is one th. confinh and do care and love is what that means. Shifting into a stronger self-worth starts with the story about what happened to us and actually what could have been is a thought exercise. Could your relationships and career have been less problemed in your life had you not experienced ongoing severe neglect or verbal abuse about being named as stupid by one of your parents, that kind of stuff. Grieving what happened is in the other part of this intervention about what you had to believe about yourself without getting any help as a little kid.",

The most important piece to healing and growing out of the feedback issues is having a healthy person in our life a therapist in your life to bounce things off of having a sounding board. A partner can do that for you, but it's actually not good if they are the therapist in your life because that might get old for them for the partner to always be talking their loved ones upset down all the time or having to confirm things for them. I mean we do that naturally in relationships. But again, the issue is how much for a sounding board back in the day. I was extremely lucky to go be able to go to a therapist with my triggers who could give me feedback literally about how my trauma might be amping up what I was feeling in a safe way. , also, validating what I was experiencing in the presence the help I got about the real or imagine stuff was invaluable for my security and my emotional security and recovery. Just in childhood. We need a lot of help about what is happening in our conflict and in our relationships and having that sounding board person is really having a healthy need finally being met. But eventually the goal is to not actually depend on a sounding board much and to eventually get to a. Place where there isn't much doubt or confusion about how we respond to feedback. Incidentally, there's a free resource online and usually shows up in Reddit forums of the AITA. Am I the a-hole forums that you see on Reddit and they're pretty great because it stands for am I the a-hole in a situation that people are kind of struggling with and they present a situation guys.

Kind of usually something small and not super kind of consequential something sometimes they don't brush their teeth. I don't mean that you're dating someone and you kind of gradually find out that they don't want children when you do that's different from what I'm kind of talking about. This one is really about how a wounded inner child can actually start to pick their partner apart. Gradually kind of subconsciously build a case against them because you feel that the romance and the newness of it is dissipating and it's moving into a more mundane thing which could be a trigger to your own parents relationships growing up. It might feel boring or it might feel scary or whatever. If you don't resonate with that, you might have been on the receiving end of someone doing that to you at some point. How the romantic attachment issues can come from childhood. One example is being parentified or being an emotional support for a parent where the worth is wrapped up in doing for them or helping. And security is actually for somebody else. Another example is narcissistic abuse where we're bound to a caretaker that isn't safe and highly damaging and security is wrapped up in getting things with them. But that game changes every day. Another is witnessing parents live in a miserable marriage. For kids there is no security if our parents really aren't secure. Another is witnessing a parent model poor romantic relationships or choices where security has to be attained through other people. Another is receiving incredibly off messages about sex or partnerships or ourselves. Because we are receiving those messages from a parent who is really poor mental health and our security becomes really confusing and it feels we have to shoot in the dark a lot in romantic relationships. Another is being raised by caretakers who behave they barely tolerate their children, we don't deserve security. Here are some potential healing and specific interventions about romantic attachment. The first is inner child work. And I think childhood trauma survivors are usually caught seeking attunement from others romantically due to having never received it during childhood because of the abuse.",

You might feel intense shame if you say no to someone in that last example if you had an uncaring or unempathic parent who was all about themselves. You might feel intense shame if you forgot your wallet at lunch and a friend covers you and that shame might be about having a parent who was entitled and took advantage of others. And being taken care of by a friend in that moment is intensely shaming or uncomfortable for you. You might feel some shame if things get a little bit messy in your apartment. Or if you feel emotionally messy if you had a parent who struggle with things hoarding or having extremely poor mental health. we can overly compensate in different ways to not seem an abusive unempathic toxic parent.

The are we goods can assimilate into people's lives for want of being kind of adopted and to be accepted. They can also have a very good chameleon ability to blend with different groups. They will not initiate conflict in any way, and they tend to avoid potential tension at all cost. All goods when in conflict usually take it a sentencing trial for their crimes. When they are in conflict, they tend to take it they're being sentenced to jail, they really can go to a shame place about something that they did, rather than not even knowing that someone might be projecting on them. The are we good can have a lot of magical thinking in that they don't really recognize abuse up front, and they will sort of have to take some time to learn that what their partner or what their parent is doing to them is really abusive. They don't really have a concept of that, kind of with the others. The are we good will have a marked tendency to chase relief in relationships. They're really relieved that you text them back. They're really relieved that your mood changed.

Speaking to that, here are some examples. This is just what I see from my clients. Hostiles can have touchers of doers in them or darkness to them. But they don't really go underground or isolate consistently a ghost. The are we goods can have touches of doers in them. And in minor ways they can also have touches of ghosts in them. All goods are never really hostiles. Those two things don't really kind of go together. In my mind I think. The darkness can have touches of hostility and ghosts. , and again some of these are fluid depending on where you are in your relationship.

And in healing childhood trauma we can shift into the opposites before we come to center and really kind of find who we were, that original spark that I mentioned in the beginning of the video. For treatment of all of these I would encourage any of these personalities to become more real about their childhood and find some anger about what happened to them and hold abusive parents accountable. you were sort of set up to both kind of adapt this personality and kind of miss out on developing what you were sort of born with.

It's possible to catch these dynamics and step out of them, which is kind of what every childhood trauma survivor kind of wants, whether it's with a male you maybe work with, a male you're dating, or a male you're dating with, or a male you're dating with, and you're caught up with issues with your own father now in the middle of this video. if you identify as queer or you don't date men, this video will be applicable and hopefully helpful to you as. If you're a male and you wanna understand your female partner better and yourself better and possibly your own father, the info here can also help you too. All childhood trauma survivors have men in their story. And if you didn't know your biological father, he affected you. When I got to therapy, I didn't really think I had much work to do around my father because I had already psychologically written him off.",

    "text": "And I didn't get at that time how much unfinished psychological business I had with my own father. And maybe you relate to that, writing him off perhaps early in your life, because that is actually a common thing with childhood trauma. Despite my language here, this video is not about bashing men or making sweeping anti-male statements. We are specifically talking about a highly abusive and or, toxic types of fathers in this video, and they are not universal to every single man. And there will most likely be a counterpart video about what happens to men in toxic relationships with their mothers or with their fathers as. Today, we're going to be exploring those specific types of toxic fathers and their impact on daughters specifically. If we can understand that, then maybe we can fix patterns that we're having with men in general. And if you don't know me, I'm Patrick Tian, I'm an MSW, and this channel, is all about childhood trauma, specifically coming from our family of origin, as a system, as discovering ways for our recovery and for our better mental health. Before I start, while any childhood trauma survivor can be exposed to toxicity in childhood by a parent, it's not what that child would have chosen. when I say toxic father and daughter dynamics, I'm not saying it's your fault, nor is a daughter responsible for the father's mess or his legacy with his own children. I am saying that because of unfinished unconscious business from our fathers, we can get caught up in toxic dynamics with them or with people in our present lives, which leads us to the first lasting problem. What we need to address is that we can end up in toxic adult relationships in our present lives due to having a toxic parent. That's the part that we really need to get real about and kind of step out of. And also, I'm listing what I've seen in 14 years of private practice as a group therapist, an individual therapist, as a couples therapist, as a therapist, and also with nearly 30 years of my own recovery in general. But I want you to really take this in. You're the expert about your relationship and your reactions in context of your father. This is your process. I'm listing patterns that I've seen.",

How might the culture that you grew up in, both inside and outside of your home, how might have all of that has kind of supported the abuse from a father. Just kind of a thought around that. I would say the type of men in my home, my father, were similar to the men on the baseball field for coaches. Not all men. Some men were very, very helpful in that way, but the town that I grew up in was aggro. that's what I mean. And those two things had an impact. And in another way, the outside stuff was supporting the inside stuff and vice versa, is what I'm trying to say. , here are the types of toxic fathers and the impact on their daughters. let's look at the types, and the types of dynamics with a toxic father and how they impact their daughters. I'm going to give a trigger warning here as some of these are intense. I'm going to structure each type along with the impact on a daughter in the following ways. I'm going to talk about the impact on a daughter's sense of self. I'm going to talk about the impact on a daughter's mental health. I'm going to talk about the impact of a daughter's sense of men, the blueprint of men, what is modeled inside and outside the home, and the impact on a daughter's replication of childhood dynamics and projection. After I'll talk about healing goals to kind of achieve with each type and what might be good to specifically do or work on if you identify with these types of fathers. I've isolated the five types of fathers that contribute to toxic dynamics as the unsafe perpetrator or the monster, the absent father or the untouchable father, the enmesher who kind of creates special relationships, the tragic codependent who's also an abused person too, and the crazy maker who creates a lot of chaos. let's start. Here is the unsafe perpetrator. Or the monster trigger warning with this type getting the most damaging type of toxic father out of the way. First, the unsafe perpetrator can be physically, sexually and emotionally abusive and unsafe. They are ruled by anger, manipulation and cycles of mood escalation.",

They tend to not really have relationships. They usually take hostages. They can have a serious mental health diagnosis. They can have substance abuse or they can have CPTSD. A daughter of a monster experiences them as terrifying very powerful. It's a very extremely tenuous relationship. It's hot and cold and it's also unpredictable. Here is the impact on a daughter her sense of self a daughter. Of an unsafe perpetrator can always feel she's in trouble and her real self is bad and unwanted and it's highly dangerous and confusing to be the real you the impact on her mental health as you can struggle here with intense general hyper vigilance anxiety dissociation shame and fear along with the fawning trauma response as some consistent dread the impact on our sense of men is the blueprint is men dominate by weaponized mood and you need to comply to be safe or hide the real you men are dangerous and not to be trusted or dealt with because they're time bombs and the dynamic is you might have to walk on eggshells regardless of the type of man that it is and the impact on the replication and projection with the monster is a daughter can find herself in very similar relationships with partners who are unsafe or a daughter can project that perpetrating father on to other people who are actually safe. That looks interpreting a partner's frustration as violence instead of seeing the frustration as normal. more on that later moving on to the next type of father is the absent stranger or the untouchable father the absent father is a range from never knowing one's biological father to having a father or stepfather in your entire childhood, but he is a stranger to you and vice versa. He doesn't intervene in any way in your life growing up or even now he doesn't protect you from siblings or an abusive mother. He doesn't know. Your birthday or what you do for a living.",

It's still neglectful somehow or feels off and he can show up at times if it's easy or beneficial to him. The absent stranger fathers can be any of these they can be totally physically absent and you don't know him they can be present but a stranger they can be totally self-consumed. They can be emotionally immature. They can be emotional. They can be emotionally limited shut down and preoccupied with anything but his daughter. He can be disinterested or profoundly blocked in not knowing how to connect which is another version of it. What makes him an untouchable could be his childhood could be substance abuse could be a mental health diagnosis or he can range from being really narcissistic to really being limited and shut down and not knowing how to connect with a daughter or connecting with anyone else not even knowing himself. It often feels sadly. That a pet would be more important to him than his own daughter. The absent stranger can also be more connecting with a son, but not a daughter. That's another dynamic there. Here's the impact on a daughter the her inner child can assume that a father this just doesn't think you're maybe worth it enough, which actually wasn't true. The impact on her mental health is that she can have core beliefs that contribute to depression and anxiety that can often be about not feeling good enough and some shame. There can also be hyper vigilance about being forgotten. Or abandoned her sense of men can be men can become icky people to avoid as if they were aliens because they were aliens or that you have to work a million times more to convince a man to be interested in you, which is really too much on anyone to put in that amount of work the replication and projection dynamic a daughter here can get caught up in chasing being known by men. And since there wasn't protection a daughter can also project that their partner is aloof or disinterested over normal stuff.",

While I don't see them as common as the last two. It is an issue with a father when the father over shares crosses boundaries is more a high school kind of messy friend than an actual father. The in measure is looking for camaraderie and care and validation from you. The in measure can seek out from you what he does not get. In his other relationships with adult women. He struggles with maturity and his daughters tend to have to parent him. He might be actually be very fun and feel safer, but he isn't a father. It's about him.

The replication and projection issue is a daughter of an in measure can find themselves with men who are the focus. And possibly projecting feelings of being used or rage about things disclosure rage about trust an important side note about replication and projection in all these is I don't believe that childhood trauma survivors attract monsters or measures or absent people are crazy makers childhood trauma survivors were never protected from such people and it got normalized. There's a difference to that moving on to the fourth one. The tragic codependent. Or the safer parent the abused to the tragic codependent father behaves as a selfless punching bag. He models to take it from the abusive person. The other abusive adult in the family. He never uses his parental power to protect or his personal power to say is enough is enough to the abusive spouse.",

I think that those are good qualities in men. But if it's coming from your inner child about what they should be a daughter can feel discussed with anyone who isn't those things. The replication projection is a daughter of a tragic codependent can experience unconscious rage or disgust with codependent men or feel compelled to support men no matter what perhaps protecting them from other women if that makes sense daughters can replicate trying to save or awaken a male due to this type of father and also this type of toxic father is greatly contributes to a distrust of other women in general on top of what the mother modeled moving on to the last one the crazy maker. The crazy making her father can range from having substance abuse issues to hoarding to general immaturity. He is a big kid and he can be seen mature in some places maybe his job, but he was really a mess in relationships. The crazy maker toxic father behaves in contradictions. They can tell you they love you, but they never show up their relationships with women are often codependent or highly dysfunctional they can make poor choices in our oblivious to the emotional impact on their children or even anyone else. else. They can be impulsive financially and vocationally and romantically.

But they can get nasty, however, if you push them about their dysfunction due to their profound immaturity. this really falls under the emotionally immature parent. The crazy maker no-shows to your graduation after just telling you that they will be there and then act it was fate's fault about not showing up. Not something that they dropped the ball on or made a conscious choice about. They are incapable of accountability. He is incredibly hard to pin down or even get answers out of.",

Projection As a daughter can find herself again with similar romantic partners or they can find a good enough partner, but still project onto them feelings that partner is a loose cannon and you can't trust them. Daughters can also project onto anyone that they're a loose cannon and possibly might need to kind of be a bit controlling around them. Or they can project rage when others are either incompetent or feel they're manipulative because that crazy make your father was both. Those are the five types and the types of impact that a father has on a daughter. Leave a comment about what really stood out for you. If I name something important to you and also many of those traits will overlap and it's common, which I'll talk more about later. What really jumped out at you. And if you're a male watching this, how is your experience similar with a father or how does your pattern of struggles with relationship. How is that kind of similar. Here are some general healing goals and ideas with each type of toxic father. In all of these, if you're still in these toxic dynamics with your own father, seek out resources. Such as therapy or codependence anonymous or codependent no more. That's a book by Melody Beattie on getting some skills together about how to detach from them instead of doing the same old battle with a father this or trying to get them to see you and still getting abused and let down space boundaries and resources. Maybe taking a break, withdrawing things no contact or low contact are all things you can look into. here are the healing goals for each of the five types. Let's start with the unsafe perpetrator, the monster. Try to stop trying to figure out the monster's behaviors and their motives. They aren't safe and figuring out why they do something abusive doesn't change that they're abusive. Our inner child wants to know why they do certain things as if that's going to really help something. They think the why will have everything makes sense when it doesn't.",

And the third kind of piece of good news is that we can learn to prioritize our own emotional being. The one thing that you really shouldn't hide out there before we startpl Geddy V WILSON and trying to figure out how you can be a scallop on the Internet instead of coaching you just hear you trying to dig through the webinar chat below. A general rule of thumb is that if our inner child is going to keep trying with or reacting to difficult people, but with the toxic father, it doesn't go anywhere and you had nothing to work with. that inner child needs an inner adult to step in and protect them from continuously trying with our actual fathers or chasing partners or chasing the wrong ones or reacting to them. And that is the blueprint and something I'll talk about in a minute called the trauma bias as. some final thoughts and some loose ends. Some loose ends to kind of get these out of the way. These are patterns that I've seen in my practice of childhood trauma. Some will feel pretty accurate to you. Others won't. I can't realistically name all the nuanced situations. Some of these may feel generalized to you or overly simplistic or maybe even too specific to you. And I hope you're able to eventually find someone safe. Who can hear your story with your father and be seen in that way. We all need that safe person to process our fathers. Another loose end is there are many fathers these types of fathers. And there are many fathers who are not these at all. There are fathers refusing to look at their trauma. There are fathers putting everything they have into raising healthy daughters. Don't just look for the toxic fathers. You'll get stuck in your own trauma. Another loose end and this needs to be named is that women are shifting. And they're voicing more dissatisfaction about their relationships with men. About equality. About hetero roles. That's an important present piece going on. It's not just a past piece to be explained through toxic fathers. Hopefully that is clear.",

As a man I might have triggered you in this video. Explore if I've actually triggered you about being too casual about these big issues. Or seemed insensitive about something or thoughtless about the topic. In some way to you that might feel really big. In this video did it feel I didn't understand things toxic masturbation. Or masculinity. Or that I was potentially mansplaining to you. That's what I mean about projection or replication. Who might I have taken you back to if I did trigger you. Maybe to your own father. What are some things that I actually got in the video. How might I be different. That is the reason to explore the projection kind of issues. Or I could have sucked too. could have been that. another thing to name is that projection is tricky. Your partner can be your father. Or they can be the opposite. Projection is about what our inner child puts onto another person. That actually belongs to the abusive father. Or another version of is that we can give up all of our power to someone. When we are projecting that they have all the power. And it's not safe to have some power. It's nuanced. It may sound it's always your fault. If you have any feelings in general. That's not what I'm saying. You might be in an abusive relationship. Or you might have been in one. And I'm not saying oh you're just projecting. But what if it's not abusive.

    "text": "As a side note, this is an example of the parents' codependency and encouraging of having no self going on. A children's personhood here is diminished and buried and kind of shamed. In this case it's other people always come first, you come last. Another example is healthy parents behave in authentic ways and they model being true to oneself. They display good boundaries, they display good choices, and they display healthy self-care and self-investment. Unhealthy parents can be shut down and overly sad. They can be selfless from a codependent place or parents can have a very inflated, grandiose sense of self where self-advocacy is always aggressive and kind of icky. To have a self here means to manipulate. Another example is healthy parents make it for their children to push back on the parental power dynamic allowing for expression but the parents are still parenting. a child can express that they don't something and there's still good enough parental discretion. Unhealthy parents overpower. They use authoritarianism or terror or they create unspoken dynamics and rules that push back from a child having really horrific consequences on the child or cause the parent to maybe fall apart if a child does push back. In this case voice and personhood are not options and are lost. Another example is healthy parents allow for emotional struggles and developmental challenges without shame or judgment. There's an understanding of a child's goals and their humanity and most importantly allowing a child to have a process. Unhealthy parents are often not child-centric and demand suppression of self and do not allow space or milestones kids kind of have to perform above their developmental stage or become little adults for the adults which isn't really real. The process of becoming a self is skipped and lost here. Lastly is unhealthy parents provide unconditional love and children still feel safe. In the inconvenient kind of balance between the two, there's a lot of messiness that is parenting. Even when the child is going through messy emotions or issues, it's something that will pass instead of it being named as who they are. I hope that makes sense. Unhealthy parents will flip the script of basic parenting into their children being problems. Which sticks to our insides and becomes our false sense of self and our self rooted in shame.",

    "text": "the idea here is it's not that you're a child it's that you're the problem. let's recap on those fundamental messages in the unhealthy parenting examples. the unhealthy parenting messages about self remember one was to have a self means to manipulate. Another is to be someone means to burden others. Another is voice and personhood are not options and are lost. Another is the process of building a self is skipped and lost. And lastly, it's not that you're a child, it's that you're a problem. And we can gather from that list that neglect and shame are major factors of not being able to develop a sense of self and safety. And as a side note, healthy parents because they're healthy, they're not projecting their own trauma in a good enough way or putting their child into roles. Healthy parents are simply not insane and apathetic. All of these things are going to also affect our sense of self if we really have a parent who's high intensity high abuse.

And I greatly appreciate your viewership and I have a hard ask which is that about 69 of my viewers who watch and comment and take in the videos are not subscribed yet. Subscribing to the channel greatly supports me in being able to get this content out to you. if you just take a second and hit the subscribe button, it really helps. given all that, how does one rebuild, jumpstart, embrace a healthy sense of self that's again rooted in power and goodness. I'm going to discuss three ways in order of what you can do here. The first one is what specifically has been missing for you when it comes to sense of self. qualities of self. Thinking over the course of your life and even if some of these things have changed, what sense of self qualities have been missing for you. Let's start here and get a sense of what needs to be jumpstarted. we have to kind of figure out what's missing. these things can look not being able to say no, not being able to take some risk, not being able to disagree with others, again struggling with things decisions, struggling with being single. Another is embracing your own.",

I know that therapy is loaded for many people or that it's not accessible as it should be. It's really where we can gradually get help in processing and uncovering. Therapy is a really good place to start and I really advocate that people try to find a trauma therapist who gets this stuff as best as you can. And I totally get it if that's really not available. Everyone has to have their own starting point and you might be more in tune with those feelings that fill your sense of self and maybe you just need to kind of need a little bit of help connecting the dots. You can get that kind of help with the membership that I offer on childhood trauma which is really up here. But again, I really advocate that you try to do your best and find a therapist. Lastly on this, and this is super important, a byproduct of good therapy or good work and grief is to try to get that emotional connection back to the body. , the first part of this is really important. It's really important to really get that emotional connection back to the body. And , what I'm really believing with getting some help around what happened to us is to come back more into our body. That we're home again in our body. If we're numb or if we live in our trauma responses or we're really dissociative or super anxious from a place of self doubt, that means we're not really in a place of self-conceit. , we need that emotional connection and feedback to develop self. The last and most important tool to rebuild a sense of self after childhood trauma is something that many people aren't really that into, which I get. But having some kind of community and getting feedback from healthy people are just really crucial to our recovery. I was able to get that in a group therapy model that I did when I started therapy. And if we're supposed to develop a sense of self as infants and toddlers from sane, healthy caregivers who can help and see us, we don't need that kind of community connection in some good enough way.",

My money story was tied to stress and chaos because my parents frequently, they were stressed out, screaming at each other, slamming doors, and it just seemed to tie into a sense of lack. Most people wanna make easy money, but they don't know how to make money easy. And my vision was to go and interview some of the world's most financially successful individuals who also have inner peace and abundance around money and also understand the dynamics of trauma around money, the wounds around money, our belief system around money. You gotta heal the money story to create a new belief system for yourself that something is possible. Lewis Howes is a New York Times bestselling author, keynote speaker, and host of one of the biggest podcasts in the world with over a billion downloads, The School of Greatness. Lewis is a former two-sport All-American athlete and former professional football player. And now he's focused on teaching people to transform their relationship with money. Struggles with our finances have a huge impact on our mental health, our physical health, our relationships, the list goes on and on. And in fact, I pulled this up because I knew you were coming in here. A study cited in the Journal of Family and Economic Issues found that financial worries are a leading cause of psychological distress. And I'm gonna talk about that in a minute. But I'm gonna talk about the psychological distress in our society today, which you already know. A meta-analysis, and this was published just in 2022 in PLOS One, determined that financial stress and depression are intimately linked. All , this is something that is impacting our lives, whether we understand it, whether we realize it, whether we it or not. And yet we are not educated about this. And I'm curious what inspired you to make this, your topic of focus, with all the things that you've done, and what inspired you to make this your topic of focus, with all the things that you've done, and what inspired you to make this your topic of focus, to have expertise in. This is something very unique. Why did you choose to get people educated on this.",

When I feel safe within my nervous system, then I can respond differently to these triggers. for me, when I felt someone was taking advantage of me, it felt abuse because I was sexually abused as a kid, talked about that on the show. And that could show up in any little thing. If someone's cutting me off in a car, it's , I could feel I'm being abused. there's little triggers where if I feel someone's trying to overcharge for something, I'm , huh, they're trying to take advantage of me. It's unfair. And I could feel this trigger. Connected to that wound. Exactly.

    "text": "While Fritzl disappeared behind bars, Elisabeth and her children had to learn what it means to be free. The first steps into freedom took place under strict protection in a psychiatric clinic. The family's reunification was an emotional earthquake. The three children from the upper world, Lisa, Monika and Alexander, had to digest the shocking truth, that their mother had never left them, but had been held captive for 24 years, and that the man they knew as their grandfather was in fact their father. For the three cellar children, Kerstin, Stefan and Felix, every experience was new. The sight of the moon, the feeling of rain on their skin, the taste of fresh air. Their world had enlarged from 60 to an infinite square meter. The physiological and psychological challenges were enormous. Years without sunlight had made the skin of the cellar children pale and sensitive. Their muscles had underdeveloped, their immune system weakened. The psychological scars were even deeper. They had to learn basic social skills, with fear and fear of death. They had to deal with it and build a completely new understanding of reality. The therapy focused on creating a coherent family identity from two radically different worlds. Elisabeth Fritzl was at the center of this healing process. The woman who had been deposed for 24 years now took on the role of the guardian and emotional anchor of her children. Her resilience was remarkable. She led her family through the traumatic transition to normality and proved that the human soul itself can overcome the deepest depths. The Austrian state reacted with a decisive measure. It granted the entire family new identities and a secret home. This investment in their safety and privacy was essential for their healing. They were able to live a life apart from media attention and the public interest. They were able to live a life apart from media attention and the public interest.

It's a triggering topic for some people, but I think at the same time, it's important to understand where this stuff really originates and where it comes from and kind of how it manifests. Co-narcissism and narcissism are two ends of the shame spectrum. One who's compensated by saying, I got to be better and superior. The other says I'm inferior. But what then happens to that is the co-narcissist now is I need you to love me to the narcissist. I will enable you to never grow up, to never deal with your issues. I will take your pain away. I will please you. I will fix you just that you love me. The narcissist and the co-narcissist both have a deep fear of abandonment. They are on their best behavior at first. They're doing what they can to meet each other's needs, but they're not getting their own needs met. Their shame is preventing. Them from being authentic.

Part of being attuned to the other person's needs and all of that is that now their emotions have more power over their own personal baggage. And that's the first step. And then the second step is to generate ahouse of rest. And that's an idea of trauma and fantasy.

    "text": "We stop playing. We stop dreaming. Because the body's only mission is to keep us alive. And while that is essential in the midst of real danger, it becomes a prison when the danger is no longer real, but our biology hasn't gotten the message. I've called this phenomenon, the body keeps the score, because no matter how much we try to suppress, ignore, or rationalize our pain, our bodies remember. They store it in tension, in tightness, in shallow breaths, in racing hearts, in digestive problems, in insomnia, and in the inability to feel present. The body does not lie. It tells the truth about what we have endured, whether we consciously remember it or not. This is why traditional talk therapy, while often helpful, is not enough on its own for many trauma survivors. Because trauma is stored not just in language and memory, but in sensation and neurobiology. You can't talk your way out of a body that feels unsafe. You can't think your way into calm. Safety must be experienced, felt, and embodied. The work of healing begins, then, with helping the nervous system shift from defense to connection, from survival to presence, from hypervigilance to regulation. And that means helping people find practices, experiences, and solutions. You can start with healing, and you'll find the healing that will make your body feel safe enough to let go. Because until the body feels safe, the mind will remain trapped in fear. Over the course of this video, we'll explore why safety is not a luxury, but a biological prerequisite for healing. We'll look at the neuroscience of trauma, the survival responses of the nervous system, the connection between trauma and the body, and most importantly, how healing happens. Not just intellectually, but through our daily lives. And don't forget to subscribe if you want to hear more. but somatically through movement, breath, rhythm, connection, and attunement. We'll explore the tools that help trauma survivors come back into their bodies, build resilience, and reclaim their lives. This message is not just for those who have been through extreme abuse or war. Trauma comes in many forms. It can be the result of emotional neglect, chronic stress, racism, poverty, or a thousand small violations of safety and connection.",

    "text": "It's biology. The freeze response is the brain's way of thinking. It's the brain's way of numbing pain, physical or emotional, and dissociating from the unthinkable. People stuck in freeze often feel disconnected, emotionally flat, or chronically fatigued. They may struggle to recall details or feel outside of their body. It's not laziness. It's a nervous system overwhelmed by trauma. Then there's fawn, a response many people don't even recognize as survival. Fawning is when you learn to please, to appease, to abandon your own needs in order to keep others calm. This often develops in childhood trauma, especially in environments with unpredictable caregivers. If love or safety was conditional, you learned to shape-shift, to silence your own discomfort, to put others first no matter the cost. In adulthood, this can manifest as people-pleasing, lack of boundaries, or difficulty asserting your needs. All of these responses serve the same function, survival. But when the trauma ends and your nervous system doesn't reset, these responses become maladaptive. You may find yourself lashing out, running away, shutting down, or over-accommodating, not because you want to, but because your body has never stopped bracing for impact. The tragedy is that most trauma survivors are not aware that they are in survival mode. They blame themselves for being too sensitive, too angry, too needy, too numb. They think something is wrong with them. But what's really happening is that their body is still protecting them long after the danger has passed. The problem isn't that they're broken. The problem is that their system hasn't felt safe enough to let go. And this brings us to something profoundly important. You can't heal if your body isn't safe enough to let go. Your body is still bracing for danger. Healing requires presence, curiosity, and self-compassion, none of which are accessible when your nervous system is in a constant state of alarm. Before we can process the trauma cognitively, we have to help the body come out of defense. We must create the conditions for safety. This is why trauma treatment that ignores the body is incomplete. Talk therapy alone often isn't enough. It can help you understand your patterns, but it can't always shift them. That's because the trauma isn't only in your thoughts. It's in your reflexes, in your breath, in the way your shoulders hunch when someone raises their voice.",

    "text": "You don't have to retell the story again and again. What you need is to feel safe not just in your mind but in your body. You need to gently guide your nervous system out of survival mode and into a space where connection, play, rest, and growth are possible again. The body is not the enemy. It's the doorway. The pain you carry is not proof that something is wrong with you. It's evidence that something happened to you, something that overwhelmed your ability to cope, to make sense of it, to integrate it. But you are not that moment. You are not that pain. You are the one who survived it. And your body, with time and compassion, can learn to feel safe again. when your heart races for no reason, when you startle at loud noises, when you can't sleep or focus or feel connected to others, don't ask, what's wrong with me. Ask, what happened to me. And how did my body learn to protect me from it. That question opens the door, not just to understanding, but to healing. And that's what we'll explore next, how safety is not just a feeling. It is a requirement for recovery. Because no one can heal while their body still believes it's in a war zone. Healing begins the moment your body feels it has finally come home. Safety. First, why talking alone isn't enough. If I could offer just one truth to every trauma survivor, it would be this. You cannot heal if your body still believes it's unsafe. We live in a culture that overvalues words. We believe that if we can talk about something enough, we can think our way out of it. We assume that healing happens in the head, in conversation, in cognition, in understanding. But trauma isn't stored in the thinking. It's stored in the thinking brain. It's stored in the emotional brain, the survival brain, and most importantly, in the body. And if the body doesn't feel safe, the mind can't truly relax. Many of my patients have already told their story in therapy, to friends, sometimes over and over again, and yet they still don't feel better. Why. Because no amount of talking can override a nervous system that's stuck in fight, flight, or freeze.",

    "text": "You can understand your trauma intellectually and still be triggered by a sound, a smell, or a facial expression. You can know, rationally, that you're not in danger, but your body will respond as if you are, because that's where the trauma lives. healing doesn't begin with words. It begins with safety. Not just external safety, but felt safety. That means your body needs to experience, moment by moment, that it is no longer in danger, that the war is over, that you don't need to brace, hide, or shut down anymore. This is why trauma recovery is fundamentally a process of retraining the nervous system. When people are traumatized, they often become disconnected from their own internal cues. They stop feeling hunger or fatigue. They lose the ability to tell whether someone is safe or not. Their body becomes a battlefield they avoid. The first step in healing is gently reconnecting, to feel again, to notice again, to sense again. This doesn't happen through logic. It happens through experience, through practices that invite the body back into the present moment. Breathing exercises that calm the vagus nerve, gentle movement that helps discharge stored tension, rhythmic activities drumming, walking, dancing, all of which regulate the nervous system. Even something as simple as placing your hand over your heart and breathing deeply can be profound. These practices don't just feel good, they rewire the brain. Therapies EMDR and somatic experiencing work because they go beyond talk. They help people access the sensations and memories held in the body, and process them in a way that allows the nervous system to complete what was once interrupted. Trauma freezes us in time. These methods help unfreeze us. It's also why relationship is essential. Safe, safe, safe, safe, safe, safe, safe, safe, safe. The connection with another human being is one of the most powerful tools we have for healing trauma. In fact, trauma often happens in relationships, through betrayal, abuse, neglect. it makes sense that healing must also happen in relationships. But not just any relationship. It has to feel safe, predictable, attuned, consistent. In my practice, I've seen people slowly begin to trust again, not because I gave them advice or solutions, but because I show them that they're not alone. But because I showed up consistently with presence and care.",

    "text": "I created a space where they could finally feel seen without being judged. That's what a safe therapeutic relationship is. A new experience of being held, regulated, and respected. Something many trauma survivors never had. Now, I know that safety can sound abstract. let me make it concrete. Safety in this context looks this. Being able to breathe fully without breaking. Being able to breathe without feeling. Feeling the ground beneath your feet. And knowing you're not about to fall. Being in the presence of another person without scanning for threat. Being able to say no without fear. Having space between a trigger and a reaction. Feeling your body belongs to you. If those things sound foreign to you, I want you to know that's not your fault. Your body adapted. It protected you. And it can learn a new way. The truth is, trauma healing is not about the physical. Trauma healing is not about going back to who you were before. It's about becoming who you were always meant to be. Before the fear. Before the hypervigilance. Before the shutdown. But that process begins always with safety. And you don't have to rush it. The body heals in the present. Slowly, gently, in layers. There is no one-size-fits-all path. Some people begin with movement. Others begin with breath. Others start with therapy. Others with art or animals or nature. But the common thread in all effective healing is this. The nervous system begins to feel safe again. When that happens, everything changes. Your body starts to relax. Your thoughts become clearer. Your emotions feel less overwhelming. You start to notice joy. Real joy. Not just the absence of fear. You can sleep. You can eat. You can love. You can laugh. You can do things. These aren't luxuries. They're signs that your system is coming out of survival. if you've been stuck, if talk therapy hasn't worked for you, it doesn't mean you've failed. It means your body is asking for something deeper. Something more fundamental. Something it never got. Safety. Presence. Regulation. Your body needs to learn that it's to exist. That the danger is gone. That you can rest. And you can. Healing is not linear. Some days will be hard. Some memories will rise when you least expect them.",

    "text": "But every moment of safety, every breath you take with ease, every moment of connection, they all count. They all matter. They are the building blocks of a new life. In the next part, we'll explore why childhood trauma is devastating, and how it shapes your brain, beliefs, and relationships long into adulthood. The power of safe relationships. How connection creates healing. When people ask me, what is the most important factor in healing trauma, they often expect a technical answer. Perhaps a type of therapy, a specific medication, or a novel brain scan. But my answer is always the same. Safe connection. The single most important ingredient in healing from trauma is a feeling of safety in relationship. Trauma, by its very nature, is isolating. It separates you from others, even if you are surrounded by people. You feel alone in your pain. And if your trauma involved betrayal, if those who were supposed to protect you were the source of harm, that isolation becomes even deeper. The world feels unsafe. People feel dangerous. Vulnerability becomes something to avoid at all costs. And yet, it is precisely that vulnerability, in the presence of safety, that opens the door to healing. This isn't just a poetic idea. It's how the human nervous system works. Our brains are wired for connection. We are social creatures. And our biology evolved to regulate itself through relationships. A calm voice, a compassionate gaze, a warm touch. These are not just emotional comforts. They are neurological regulators. They tell our bodies, you are safe now. When a child is scared, the first thing they do is look for a caregiver. Not just for protection, but for regulation. The caregiver's calmness becomes the child's calmness. That's co-regulation. Our ability to use the nervous systems of others to regulate our own. And it doesn't end in childhood. As adults, we still need safe, attuned relationships to bring our systems back into balance. This is why trauma that occurs in the context of relationships, abuse or neglect, must be healed in the context of relationships. You cannot heal relational wounds in isolation. You may find insight alone. You may practice techniques alone. But deep emotional healing requires being seen, heard, and felt by another human being who is safe, present, and non-judgmental. For many trauma survivors, this is the most difficult part of the healing journey.",

    "text": "Trusting another person. Letting someone in. Risking connection. But it is also the most transformative. When a survivor experiences a safe relationship, whether in therapy, friendship, community, or love, their nervous system learns something profound. Not all people are dangerous. Not all closeness leads to pain. I can be connected and still be safe. In therapy, this is called the therapeutic alignment. The relationship between therapist and client. And while many models of therapy exist, the healing power of that relationship is consistent across the board. When the therapist is attuned, accepting, and reliable, the client begins to internalize safety. Their nervous system, once stuck in fight or flight, begins to rest. The body learns it doesn't have to brace for danger all the time. It's important to say that safe connection doesn't mean perfect or flawless. It means consistent, caring, and responsive enough to allow for repair when ruptures happen. Because no relationship is without mistakes, even in therapy. But the key is repair. When a rupture happens, and the other person responds with honesty, care, and accountability, it sends a powerful message to the trauma survivor. You're not too much. You're not broken. We can move through this together. If you've been traumatized, you may have developed what we call relational adaptations. You might keep people at arm's length. You might people-please to stay safe. You might become hypervigilant to others' moods or withdraw completely. These are not flaws. These are survival strategies. But over time, if we want to move from surviving to living, we have to replace these adaptations with something new. Something that allows for connection without fear. This is why group therapy, peer support, and somatic communities can be powerful. They offer repeated, lived experiences of safety in the presence of others. They recondition the nervous system through real-time interaction. They give the body what it never got. The experience of being in relationship without having to disappear, perform, or protect. If you are healing from trauma, I want you to hear this. You are not meant to do it alone. You were hurt in relationship, and you must be healed in relationship. Not because you are weak, but because you are human. Because your body, your brain, your heart, all of them are wired to thrive through connection.",

    "text": "I can feel. I can move. I can exist without fear. One of the most powerful interventions we can offer is not a technique. It's presence. To sit with someone. To breathe with them. To attune to their body. To co-regulate with them until their body begins to move. To be able to feel. To feel. To feel. To feel. To feel. To feel. Until their body begins to believe it is safe again. Because trauma is about terror in isolation. But healing is about safety in connection. And that begins in the body. Why talking isn't enough. The limits of cognitive insight. There is a -meaning but misguided belief in modern mental health treatment. That if you can just talk about it, you'll heal. If you can put your pain into words, explain it, analyze it, understand it, then you'll finally be free of it. But trauma doesn't work that. Not fully. Talking can help. Understanding can help. Language is powerful. It gives shape to what was once unspoken. It gives you a sense of control. Meaning coherence. But insight alone doesn't heal trauma. Why. Because trauma lives in parts of the brain that language doesn't reach. When we experience trauma, the brain shifts. The prefrontal cortex, the part responsible for reasoning, reflection, and verbal expression, shuts down. Meanwhile, the amygdala, the fear center, becomes hyperactive. The body floods with stress hormones. The rational mind goes offline. The emotional and sensory brain takes over. In that moment, you are no longer forming a narrative. You are surviving. Your brain is encoding sensations, images, and feelings. Your trauma is stored in the implicit memory system, not as a story, but as fragments, triggers, bodily responses, flashes of emotion. And these implicit memories are not easily accessed through talk alone. That's why someone can say, I know it wasn't my fault, and still feel deep shame in their body. That's why a veteran can describe a battlefield in perfect detail. That's why a soldier can describe a battlefield in perfect detail. That's why a soldier can describe a battlefield in perfect detail. But still wake up shaking from nightmares. That's why survivors of abuse can explain everything that happened, and still freeze when they hear a certain voice, or smell a certain cologne. Because trauma is not just a story you tell. It's a state your body remembers.",

    "text": "what does this mean for healing. It means we need more than cognitive therapy. We need therapies that work with the body, the senses, and the subconscious. We need methods that can access the non-verbal parts of the brain. The hemisphere, the limbic system, the brain stem. This is why techniques EMDR, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, yoga, neurofeedback, somatic experiencing, art therapy, and rhythmic movement are powerful. They reach the places that words cannot. They speak the language of the body, the language of sensation, rhythm, and movement. The language trauma speaks. I've seen people spend years in talk therapy, gaining insight after insight, and still remain stuck. Still triggered. Still numb. Still unable to relax or connect. Not because they're doing something wrong, but because their therapy is only speaking to the thinking brain. Not the survival brain. Not the body. This is not a criticism of talk therapy. It's a call for expansion. The goal isn't just to understand what happened. It's to experience yourself differently in the present. It's one thing to say, I know I'm safe. It's another to feel it in your chest, your breath, your muscles. It's one thing to say, I'm allowed to set boundaries. It's another to feel empowered in your body when you say no. It's one thing to say, I deserve love. It's another to stay present and regulated when someone offers it. This is what real healing looks. Not just new thoughts, but new experiences. Not just information, but integration. This is why safety matters much. Not just physical safety, but emotional, relational, nervous system safety. Because only in that state can the brain begin to rewire. Can the body begin to release. Can the trauma begin to be processed instead of reenacted. Safety is not the end goal. It is the beginning. The foundation. The soil in which you are. The soil in which healing grows. Without it, therapy can become another performance. Another mask. Another place where you say all the things while your body still lives in a war zone. But with it, with real embodied safety, something miraculous happens. The body begins to feel. The brain begins to integrate. You begin to shift. Not because you're forcing yourself, but because something deep inside is finally letting go. That's when you realize you're not broken. You were protecting yourself.",

They get really angry if you poke at their grandiose or victimized sense of self, and they get really defensive, rageful, and mean. And all that's the stuff I talk about on the narcissistic rage video if you want to check that out. , let's talk about the shame-rage cycle. Theorists such as Lewis, who write about shame and mental health in general, have very much described this cycle in a much more scientific, -articulated way. Basically, when a narcissist gets activated, perhaps someone questions them, or does better than them, or asks for a little more from them, or just simply holds the narcissist accountable. The narcissist experiences two things, kind of in order, shame and then rage. The rage is a manifestation of vindictiveness, retaliation, punishment. In essence, wanting their perceived perpetrator to feel as bad as them. , let's talk about shame. Narcissists are not the only ones who feel shame. We all do. It's a universal emotional state. Shame is a sort of public emotion based on the idea that we will be seen and then subsequently rejected or discarded for our shortcomings, our deficits, our vulnerabilities, and that the uncomfortable parts of ourselves will be exposed to the world. And that's really uncomfortable. And when we don't process our shame, some of which we carry from early childhood, it turns into negative emotional states that can plague us throughout our lives. Negative emotions such as depression, anxiety, hostility, and these appear to be, when they appear, we get triggered, or they get triggered by a shame-inducing event. And why does that happen. Because we're afraid our deficiencies. We're afraid our deficiencies will be seen. Shame harms us from the outside in and the inside out. , narcissists get into a real cycle of anger when their shame is triggered, which actually works for them. Because at that moment, when they're , , I'm not dealing with this, they aren't having to grapple with the really horrible internal feelings that shame evokes. Instead, what they do is, instead of dealing with the feelings, they just get angry at the person who evoked the shame, whether the other person intended to do or not.",

It doesn't mean you have to give up on the friendship or the relationship with the flying monkey, but, you may want to proceed with more firm boundaries and be armed with the recognition that this person, it was a friend that became a flying monkey, that they were able to do that to you. One of the hallmarks of survival from narcissistic abuse is to move cautiously and slowly, but it's important that you learn to not justify and to not get lost in the cognitive dissonance swamp. Sadly, going forward, it may feel a friendship or relationship with this former flying monkey that's less deep. Again, a key mantra of narcissistic abuse survivorship is to protect yourself on the basis of the wisdom of the lessons that you've learned from the narcissistic relationship. And that means caution and boundaries. Number four, not all flying monkeys are created the same. Some are trying to play both sides, being your friend and the narcissistic person's friend.

The struggle that comes up with the term codependency is that this term is nonspecific and poorly defined that it ends up taking in a lot of territory, including a person who is in a search. their associates. every single person you talk to often calls the term codependency, I think it has a different meaning. who's a rescuer, who might be termed dependent or needy or indecisive. In 1986, Tim and Cermak published a list of criteria he wanted to have included in the DSM as a formal diagnosis of codependency as a personality disorder. Now obviously that never happened, but in the article he had laying all this out, he laid out the criteria. Basically he highlighted the dynamic of the codependent person as a person who gets their self-esteem in part through enduring an unhealthy relationship and they keep other people stuck in that relationship too, classically in a family relationship, and they do this even though it is hurting everyone. In Cermak's definition it came down to the following. It came down to putting the needs of other people ahead of the codependent person's own needs. He also highlighted the anxieties that arise from separation in the codependent dynamic. There's also the process of enmeshment that we see in codependent relationships, which is really just a very, very tangled boundaries and an unwillingness to draw appropriate boundaries, especially with people who are on a particular level of certain kinds of psychiatric and psychological disorders, substance use disorders and personality disorders most specifically. Now Cermak also highlighted patterns, including denial, holding back emotions, depression, hypervigilance, which hypervigilance is sort of always being on edge and jumping and chronically monitoring your environment for threats. Other things include compulsive behavior and anxiety.",

By over helping the addict or over giving to them, in essence, enabling the addict's substance abuse by not drawing the painful boundaries. This whole terminology of codependency describes a family system that's often characterized by patterns such as denial, lack of communication, and again going back to Cermak's definition, a restricted expression of emotions. overall. When we look at the range of definitions on codependency, codependent individuals are often observed to deny their own healthy needs. And they attempt to save or rescue the problem person in the family system. For example, the alcoholic. Whether by denying the problem or by repeatedly rescuing them with caregiving or money or other resources. Now definitions of codependency have since broadened beyond addiction to take in other kinds of problematic, difficult relationships including just generally difficult family dynamics. Family dynamics that center around abuse as relationships associated with other mental illnesses and personality dynamics. But the general idea is that one parent. Or other adult family members. Just keep sticking it out with the toxic person despite the harm it is bringing to everyone. Namely, their children. Now in my experience of working with hundreds of people in these family situations, I have to say that I have observed that being raised in an invalidating family can absolutely create the risk of a person's life being affected. And that is the most common dynamic in these families. Because maybe if you were enough, someone in your family system would have had your back. Or maybe the invalidating things you are regularly told were true because no one had your back and advocated for you and they would have if you were enough. Over time a child for no other reason than for survival may also have a very strong sense of self-esteem. And that is the most common dynamic in these families. Some of these children, at the age of 23 through 27 may also participate in denying the problems within the family. what it is, everything is fine. Our family is great. Everything is fine.",

And had she or he not followed the rules at all. He or she has sinned in a sexual or sexual toy. partner. This is all a replay of trying to win over the unwinnable parent. Interestingly, even though a person could grow up in a family system that played out this, again, codependent dynamic, they may actually remain blind to it and not recognize it in their adult relationships. Instead of questioning the unhealthy dynamic, they accept it because it is all they know. And honestly, it would probably be too destabilizing to question it. Becoming educated about the pattern and also being educated about the revelation that these patterns are not likely to change much do rally many people out there out of their blindness to these patterns and can awaken people to make a change. But the risk of just dismissing these patterns in narcissistic relationships as largely codependent and just simply casting the person in a narcissistic relationship in the role of being an enabler or solely as a victim that is complicit in their own abuse, that can often set a precedent that pathologizes a person for simply wanting to make a relationship change.

But the fact is that the dynamic raised by the definitions of codependency that we've put out there definitely have parallels. There are parallels that we cannot ignore, the narcissistic relationship and the codependent relationship. We know that narcissistic relationships are characterized by the denial of your own needs. Because honestly it's protective. At some level that your needs are not going to be met within this relationship. They're also characterized by anxiety when the discarding phase begins. Denial about what is really happening in the relationship. Saying things , but we do have good days. Hyper vigilance because you do not know when that narcissist is going to have that injury and fly into a rage. Stress that can culminate into physical and significant mental health issues. And here is where it gets even more bleak. One of the issues that often comes up in codependent relationships is this idea of constriction of emotions. Meaning that the codependent person does not feel safe or at times even able to share their emotions. And yet we know that sharing those emotions is dangerous and it's invalidating. the question is, does that emotional constriction, that holding back on sharing your emotions, does that happen in other places in the person's life. Some people. Some people who are stuck in narcissistic relationships have learned how to be very judicious and they've learned to not share their emotions with the narcissist in their life but have a full and beautiful range of emotions with other people who are safe and healthy and loving. it's not they're constricted everywhere. We know that codependency is a cycle that can span a person's lifetime. And there are some people who have a very strong emotional connection to their partner, but they don't always have a strong emotional connection to their partner. They may have a codependent family of origin. And that could be due to many issues. That could be due to alcoholism, other addictions, or narcissism and other high conflict personality styles in that codependent family of origin. And what this can do is that this can set up a vulnerability going into adulthood. But that vulnerability is not a destiny. It's not a guarantee. Plenty of people break out of codependency.

No human being should ever have to be a psychological punching bag for another person, to have to be the pacifier or the regulation tool for another human being. Nobody. That's the narcissistic person's damned responsibility to get some therapy, get a grip, take some personal responsibility, and stop using the world as their emotional toilet. And to the scapegoat, remember that you owe the narcissistic person and frankly the people around them nothing. And I'm not saying that you owe the person who's been abused. I'm not saying that you owe the scapegoat. I'm not saying that you owe the person who's been abused. I'm not saying that you owe the themselves for everything. I'm not saying that you owe others for everything. I swear I don't owe any of those people shit. I'm saying that because they know it. I know you owe them for your fun, because they know you made them suffer, but it's also my responsibility to be patient about what you already and how you thank them.

By and large, when survivors of narcissistic abuse are not able to communicate, they are not able to communicate with their children. , if you are not able to communicate with your children, you are not able to communicate with your children. , if you are not able to communicate with your children, you are not able to communicate with your children. engage in no contact. It's very self-protective. It is defeat. It is helplessness. It's a last resort. There's a lot of grief. When a narcissistic person goes no contact, it is often ego. It is punitive. And it's a way to maintain control and power. Show everyone who's boss. And when this is done by a parent, it's also unacceptable. Their role is inherently different than that of a child and was far more developmentally impactful. , then that entitled hypocrisy pops up. They have been doing these fits and spurts of no contact for years and silent treatment when it worked for them they could punish you as part of their adult tantrum. And this hypocrisy feels really unjust. That they're allowed to go silent, that they could disappear and not respond. And yet, when you finally decide to end contact, you're faced with rage and a character assassination. Now it also gets complicated as time goes on. You may go no contact with a parent or a family member or a family system and then life happens. People get sick, people die. For some reason, you may get pulled in and some survivors feel shame, they failed because you might think that you broke no contact, that you failed at that. It's not true, you didn't fail. But rather, that period of no contact was essential and invaluable. To you developing more autonomy, divesting from a system that denied your authenticity, your healing, you've been building up other supports. if and when you do get pulled back into a family system for some reason, you are now stronger.",

All of these reasons highlight the injustice that makes healing from narcissistic abuse difficult. And that healing often means getting with people not being. And that healing often means getting with us. to the end, we want our parents sign off, even if they're not narcissistic parents sign off, we want them to sign off on what we do.

And those of you who do not perceive an issue with your families or actually come from healthy families are probably not watching this video. to those of you who went no contact, I'm gonna ask you a couple of questions. Was that an easy decision. Did you just go no contact after one argument. Did you go no contact because your family did one thing that hurt your feelings. Did you go no contact. Was that because your parent didn't agree with you. My guess is no, you didn't. You went no contact because of an endless accumulation of wounds, hurts, invalidations, and in some cases, frank abuse and trauma that would be re-experienced every time you were with the narcissistic parent or a family system. And ultimately, it became a choice between your identity and mental health and wellbeing and life and continuing to see through some kind of obligation, or guilt, or sense that only people in really bad situations go no contact. To those of you who have not gone no contact, but keep enduring the same abusive patterns, I know the reasons that people stay in these family systems. Some people maintain contact because they feel guilt, obligation, doubt their own perception of the situation, and wonder if maybe they're reading it wrong, or they're being unfair, or they're making too big a deal out of it. Some of you stay in contact with a family because you have financial ties to a family, or because you are interlinked into a family system in which maybe you have children whom you want them to have a relationship with grandparents or extended family, but you still wonder if your parent will do to your kids what they did to you. Some of you have parents who threaten to harm themselves or even harm your other parent. Some of you are afraid to go no contact, if you don't show up, and you can't keep calling 911, it's just easier to show up. Some of you are still trauma bonded and think that it can still change.",

And the subjugation cycle will then shift to how selfish and unforgiving that you are, that you can't just let go of the past junior. And they were just not ready to be a parent, et cetera, et cetera. the drill. Listen, I can say this as a therapist. I have worked with many, many clients where in my heart, my hope was that they would go no contact. Because I could see how different they were. And I could see how different they were. And I could see how different they were. I was devastated. They were every time they had contact with their parents or their family of origin, and they were living their lives in a psychological purgatory with parents who had no capacity for insight. But it wasn't my place to say go no contact. My role was to support their decisions and shore them up for the inevitable disappointment and help them connect the dots. I have also had clients go no contact and doubt that decision every single day. And every often, there was a client who went no contact and blossomed, and they saw that the going no contact is what contributed to their growth. There is one more twist here. And that is if you are a parent who is disengaging from a toxic, narcissistic, manipulative, antagonistic child, it raises similar issues. Now, if the parent who's disengaging is antagonistic and the child is antagonistic, then all bets are off. And I just hope that nobody really gets hurt. But if the parent who's choosing to disengage, is not antagonistic, or perhaps one parent was and the other parent was not, and the non-antagonistic parent is the one who's choosing to disengage, the damage is done where the child's concerned, some parents, after years of being financially abused, lied to, taken advantage of, raged at by their child, will come to this decision as.",

The scapegoated child in the family system is the most likely to have the most significant mental health impacts of childhood. Remember, this is an entire childhood that has been pockmarked by manipulation, rage, emotional abuse, and perhaps also physical and other forms of abuse by being gaslighted and all of this can result in a wide spectrum of issues in adulthood, including patterns that we observe in complex PTSD, anxiety, depression, as a chronic state of living in self-doubt, self-blame, major impacts on self-esteem, difficulties with decision-making, and a daily mantra of feeling not good enough. There can also be long-term decisional or behavioral outcomes and these can include things maladaptive coping, as we call it, and those maladaptive coping is just bad coping, using substances to cope or other dysregulated behaviors using drugs. Using food to cope, using shopping, using gambling, any of that, and most pointedly, having difficulties in adult relationships and choosing partners who replicate the invalidation cycle of childhood. Choosing partners who recapitulate all of your mantras about not being enough. In addition, scapegoats tend to sell themselves short throughout their lives.

    "text": "Because that to me is the most painful legacy the scapegoat often carries, self-blame. Another issue that scapegoated people from narcissistic family systems can face is that in many cases, they may actually get stuck in their family of origin. They may get caught up in the narrative of hope that the family will change, or they will internalize the manipulation and guilt and keep feeling responsible for their family of origin. And they may get fully stuck in the system, never feeling that they can go cast out on their own and find their own path in life and get away from the toxicity. And they may also forever feel responsible for this manipulative system that is all too happy to keep the scapegoat in their place and not allow them to become their full selves. But all is not lost. I really believe the scapegoat has very real gifts and these gifts, if they can be dusted off and really regarded, can be a critical part of healing. Foremost amongst these gifts is that people who are in this scapegoat role are very empathic. Now as a sidebar, I will say that there is unfortunately a small group of scapegoats whose personalities did get badly shaped by their own personal lives. And I think that's a really important part of healing. The post-trauma of the chronic psychological abuse of a narcissistic family. And in those cases, we could see a pattern that looks more covert narcissism. I do think there's a subset of scapegoats who go on to narcissism. But in the vast majority, there is a deep empathy, sometimes too much empathy. Maybe that is because as a child, they had a rich fantasy life around how they had hoped to be treated. Maybe it's inherent in the child who was the scapegoat because they were temperamentally empathic. And that almost made them an easier target for the narcissistic parent because that scapegoated child, being empathic, would be less likely to fight back.",

However, in a healthy relationship, that warmth and that empathy and awareness of others actually can be a gift that scapegoated children may actually develop in adulthood. And there's another gift I really do see that scapegoated people have. Although in order to access this gift, you often need a really good course of therapy with a therapist who actually understands trauma and narcissistic abuse. One day, whether it is to protect the child in themselves who was never protected, or whether it is because they actually enter, a scapegoated person actually enters a healthy relationship in adulthood and recognizes what healthy love looks and experiences it, and even supported by their partner feels safer to set a boundary, or whether it's therapy and a therapist saying, what happened to you. What happened to you. What happened to you. What happened to you. What happened to you. What happened to you. What happened to you. What happened to you in childhood was not , and you were not to blame. Or whether it's that scapegoated person just hits that wall and says enough.

In fact, my goal for scapegoated people is to really understand the dynamics of narcissism, especially in long-term relationships, and to recognize that it does not change.

We're not going to argue verbally anymore. You're welcome to keep arguing, but you have to write it down. they had a notepad and he would write down what he was thinking or feeling.

And I'll be defining those experiences because I do believe that the different types of experiences common to FSA survivors, and these are research-based, I didn't just pull these up out of the air, or make them up, or, oh, it happened to me, it must be happening to everybody. I have been doing various types of qualitative, that means someone's lived experience. Sometimes we call that feminological research, qualitative research. And that is what supported my introductory guide on family scapegoating abuse when I introduced the term. let's get to the 16 experiences common to survivors of family scapegoating abuse. Number one, you may identify as being codependent or highly sensitive and empathic. You may have the fawn submit response to avoid conflict or people pleasing. Alternatively, you may have no problem setting boundaries and will defend yourself without hesitation if you feel you are being disrespected or violated in some manner. And when I say response, I'm talking about trauma responses. I saw all of the trauma responses within the. Not only my work with clients, but in my FSA research. Two, you may have difficulty expressing your feelings because at a very young age, you learn to be careful about revealing too much of yourself as it would be used against you by family members. You may have been told by a parent or other family member that you are cold, unloving, insensitive, too sensitive, heartless, and on. And you may have been told by a parent or other family member that you are heartless, insensitive, too sensitive, heartless, and on. And you may have been told by a parent or other family member that you are cold, unloving, insensitive, too sensitive, heartless, selfish, dramatic, narcissistic, stubborn, et cetera, by a scapegoating parent when you did attempt to express your honest emotions and experiences even when you were very young.",

Again, it's a myth that scapegoating only happens behind closed doors. Maybe that's true for narcissistic abuse. I don't know, but I can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt, it will happen in front of you. Example, parents saying when Janie's in the room, Janie was such a difficult baby. She has many emotional problems and this might even happen with friends you bring home or dates. Nine, you may be accused of faking a genuine illness or injury by one or more people in your family, nuclear or extended. Again, that can get wrapped up into the scapegoat narrative and now that tumbleweed or snowball is bigger and bigger, collecting more. Data, to speak, to supposedly support your being somehow defective or problem in your family. And I do have a little passage on that, number nine in my book about faking, being accused of faking illnesses or injuries by family members. And I have a video here. if you click on the video tab, look from my homepage, there's a menu on the top and click on the video tab. Or look through my playlist on the homepage and you'll find a video called you're faking it. Ten, you blame yourself for any relationship difficulties you experience as an adult, fearing that there is something innately wrong with you and that you are somehow damaged and defective. , why wouldn't you. Because you've been told that your whole life. , I mean, some of you, your whole life. It is you. It's always you. , this is such a no brainer and such an obvious thing to say. And I'm sure all of you have thought of this before, but think about it. If you were physically assaulted by a family member, you would be believed, hopefully by an outside entity that you reported this to, or secondly, you'd be supported with the physical assault with bruises visible. That everyone can see. But when you're a victim of this type of psycho-emotional abuse, invisible abuse, you can even be told by family members that you must have done something wrong and you should apologize to the person who in fact abused you.",

    "text": "Shame, chronic shame, is one of the most complex, corrosive, and immobilizing emotions. It often underlies pain, anxiety, and depression. Shame is a cancer, a tumor that grows from the injury of trauma and the wound of betrayal. This interpersonal trauma becomes deeply lodged in the body-mind and then metastasizes, infecting all aspects of a person's life. They include a loss of connection with our authentic, spontaneous self, as with our basic sense of goodness, rightness, and belonging in the world. I believe that there are two main sources of toxic shame. The first is when we're traumatized, abused, and humiliated as young children. We experience this as an overall sense of badness, badness that something is fundamentally wrong with us. The second is the fear that comes from being ostracized from a group. And this can happen at different ages. For a young child, it's as though the only way we can change is by being a victim. It's as though the only way we can change is by being a victim. It's as though the only way we can change is by being a victim. It's as though the only way we can change is by being a victim. The third is that we can make sense of how poorly we've been treated, how we've been mistreated, especially by those who are supposed to take care, cherish, and love us, is to lay the blame on our own badness. In other words, the way that we try to make sense of this is to somehow assume that we were the cause of that abuse and that shaming and that humiliation. And this allows the child to imagine that they have some small modicum of control in an otherwise uncontrollable situation. Of course, these core beliefs are the words and explanations of the adult. I'm speaking them from the child, but the child's, their mind is very different than the adult mind. For children, it's this primitive internalized deduction that occurs without words, context, or even thoughts. It's just an overwhelming oppressive sensation of our own badness. But again, at least it gives us some modicum of control because if we were the cause of it, then somehow maybe we could alleviate some of that. The child somehow senses that we need our parents for us to survive.",

I have to be careful of that. what are some of the mechanisms you guys use in REACT. what are some of the things that help people get to those core issues. it's divided into two phases. part of what you realize with trauma is it's- healing trauma means reprocessing it. That doesn't mean just going into the pain and sitting in the pain as if there's benefit in just feeling pain. It means I'm going now with tools that I can learn from it, that I can heal it. -. that I can grow through it. That's reprocessing it. But there's a risk in taking people to reprocess it because you are opening a can of worms. It is going to take them to some pain and trigger them. And they need what we call agency. They need a certain amount of tools before they ever get to the trauma or else the trauma is going to overwhelm them. I see. you guys work on those tools. phase one is self-awareness, basic tools, emotional recognition. Emotional regulation, what to do if you're triggered, building a safe community for people that they can share emotions and not have anybody judge them where people hold space for them. that's phase one. Then phase two, we start digging into shame. We dig into anger. We dig into emotions. We dig into boundaries. We dig into grief and loss. And we start getting into the kind of the main areas of trauma and really help people begin to heal. the first half of the week is really digging deep into it. And then the second half is practical tools and what does healthy look. Shame is such a huge magnet, huh. Huge. How does shame start. Is that a fair question about shame. What's a- I think it's-.

And the damage that it does that just brings them to a desperation point that I got to get help or I'm going to lose everything. Then with younger people, there's this greater and greater kind of self-harm, suicidal ideation. Deep in their thinking that's going on.

    "text": "And this is that having complex PTSD, similar to what we talked about before with getting an apartment or securing work, puts you in a lot of weirdness. You end up in a lot of weird scenarios that other people would not be able to properly advise you on. you end up lying to them because it's easier to just not have the conversation because they would see what you're doing as a problem, whereas the thing you're doing is actually the solution to a different problem. Maybe you're in an unhealthy relationship. Maybe you're in a relationship where if you told people about it, they would be , ooh, that sounds unhealthy or abusive and you should get out. but that you would not be financially secure if you were to leave that relationship. that you don't have many other sources of emotional support if you were to leave that relationship. And this is not me advocating for staying in unhealthy or abusive relationships. I'll leave some resources in the description of this video for places you can go to find support and find help if you find yourself in one of those situations. But I do think it's very common for people with complex PTSD to end up in unhealthy relationships and feel they can't tell other people the truth about what's going on in their relationships because other people don't understand that those relationships are, , you, the one in it, might realize you're in a bad situation. You also see the problems that relationship is solving. The same thing could be said for addiction. People might look at your drinking or your drug use and go, that's a problem. Of course it is, and it is. And still, it's the only way that you are able to wake up in the mornings. It is the only way that you are able to get your traumatic flashbacks to stop. And again, I'm also not advocating for drinking or drug use, but I'm saying to the survivor, using substances is often a solution or a way of managing your own symptoms of trauma if you don't have the help for dealing with the trauma itself. And if you were to tell other people the full extent of how you're using substances, they would be , whoa, you need to stop.",

    "text": "Hey guys, I'm Heidi Priebe. Welcome back to my channel, or welcome if this is your first time here. On this channel, we use different psychological models as means of understanding ourselves better, understanding other people better, and overall trying to improve the health of our relationships and our life in general. what that means is getting more of what we do want out of our lives and our relationships and less of what we don't want. And today, the psychological model I'm going to be referencing is the model of complex post-traumatic stress disorder. Now, I'm not gonna go too deep into what CPTSD is. If you don't know, I will leave some links in the description of this video you can go learn a little bit more before coming back. But I also wanna make it clear that you don't have to have CPTSD to relate to what I'm gonna say in this video. much of what I say is going to apply to anyone who struggles with feelings of toxic shock. To toxic shame. As anyone who may have a very insecure attachment style. the reason I'm using the term CPTSD is because I believe that what I'm about to talk about applies most directly to those with CPTSD. However, if you recognize yourself in this video, it doesn't necessarily mean you have CPTSD because the cycle that I'm about to describe is going to apply to people in a wide range of contexts. what I wanna talk about today is the relationship between toxic shame and procrastination. And how this can become a cycle that ends up feeling quite self-defeating for a lot of people who struggle with it. the procrastination or the not getting things done or the watching problems in your life pile up larger and larger over time is kind of what I look at as a symptom of a more underlying problem. The underlying problem being a sense of toxic shame and the belief that everything that goes wrong in your life, that the ways in which you struggle, to tend to practical or emotional or relational concerns is due to you just being an inherently flawed or broken person.",

    "text": "The story you might tell yourself if you have that shame-bound personality is the reason I can't just get it together and be a normal person is because I am defective and flawed and there's something wrong with me. In the healing process you're able to look back over your life including the failed relationships, the ways in which you have let yourself down, the opportunities you missed, the mental health challenges you developed, the ways you neglected to take care of yourself and you're able to give a proper name to yourself. And that's what CPTSD is all about. It's about being able to give a proper name for the root cause of those problems which is complex trauma. And framing it this way is likely to take a lot of shame out of your own self-concept because that you are not just a failure who can't get anything. You've been grappling with some really deep wounds that you were previously ill-equipped to cope with. Second thing you can realistically expect in the healing process from complex PTSD is you learn to seek enough solace in intimate relationships. And the reason I think that's important enough here is because this isn't a redemption fantasy. Having complex trauma and deep interpersonal wounding from a young age does mean it's a pretty big uphill battle when it comes to forming and maintaining healthy relationships. But as Pete Walker says, we're not looking for perfection, we're looking for good enough. For a lot of my early life I kind of felt I was living in this desert when it came to connection. I didn't have the skills to actually share my authentic self with people. I was only forming very superficial connections that weren't really enough to sustain me emotionally. And the problem with being in that kind of desert of loneliness was that anytime someone came by and they had a water bottle, even if there was poison in it, I would take it from them and drink it because there was this part of me that desperately wanted to be seen on a deep level that I didn't really care what the cost of that was.",

    "text": "And sometimes there was a really high cost because often the only people I felt deeply seen by were other people who struggled with toxic shame and trauma themselves and who, myself for much of my early life, did not have healthy relating skills. And at this point in my life I would say there are two people in my life who both know me very deeply and care about me in a fairly consistent way, as a slowly expanding circle of people who I believe it might be possible for me to form those types of connections with in the future. And having those connections is kind of having a narrow river of water and a river of water. And I think that's a really important part of the process. it's not an ocean by any means, it's not an oasis in the desert, but it provides me with enough deep connection to sustain me. And what that means is that when someone walks by and they offer a water bottle that is poisoned, I can say no thank you, I'm. And I can use the water that I have to strengthen myself enough to slowly keep expanding that river over time. again, a healed state does not mean your life is suddenly bursting with deep, intimate connections, but it does likely mean that you no longer have to reach and cling to really unhealthy dynamics out of desperation. That's sort of what I consider healed enough on the relational level when it comes to toxic shame. Third thing you might be able to realistically expect in the healing process is an increased ability to recognize when you're in an emotional flashback and to be forgiving towards yourself about the less than perfect ways that you cope while you're in them. experiencing an emotional flashback or a period of age regression very often leads us to grasping for primal coping mechanisms. things comfort eating, self-medicating, in some cases seeking out compulsive attention or sex. And in the recovery process, we can learn that the real problem is not that we lack self-control. It's that we're either triggered in some way, or there's some feeling very alive inside of our bodies that we haven't yet found a way to consciously recognize and address. our inner children are working overtime to recognize and address that.",

And again that's a long process but it is absolutely possible. Fifth thing you can realistically expect from the complex PTSD healing process is you start to develop increasingly good discernment about who to trust and in what capacity and the latter is very important. before I took on any sort of healing work in my life I remember feeling the only other people who kind of got me were other people who had some version of complex trauma, extreme attachment wounding, or toxic shame, or depression, or some other debilitating mental illness themselves. And I didn't put it in that language. The language that I kind of had at that point was I'm messed up and I only get along with other messed up people. When I stand next to someone who I consider normal I feel a freak and I get really upset. And I think that's a really good thing to do. And I think that's a really good thing to do. And I think that's a really good thing to do. And I cannot wait to get out of there. And what I tended to think was because someone gets me and because they aren't put off by my kind of rotating door of neuroses that they see once they get close enough that must mean that this is a good person for me to get really close to and to start to co-regulate with. Now again I would never have used that language at that time. I would think more along the lines of thank god another broken person let's go party. And at this point in my journey what I've learned is that yes I'm probably forever no matter how far I come along this road going to relate best to the person I'm going to be with. And I think that's a really good thing to do. I need to relate best to those who also have a history of toxic shame or trauma.",

I look at myself in the mirror and I go don't leave me now. This is when I need my own compassion the most. It doesn't really count as self-love if I only show up for myself and I only love myself on the days when I am doing everything and it's really easy to love myself. It counts as deep pervasive self-love if I'm able to show up and have compassion for myself when I'm struggling the most. And a big part of the complex PTSD healing process is learning to re-parent yourself in a way that is loving, understanding, and patient. Because you now know that everybody makes mistakes that is a part of life and it is a good thing to make them. You don't need to hate yourself for not getting everything the first time. Seventh thing you can expect to happen in the complex PTSD or toxic shame recovery process is that you start to have a restored faith that there are kind and competent adults out there who you have the ability to learn from. This is something that Pete Walker talks about extensively in his book. And he talks about his own process of learning to learn from others. And he talks about his own process of learning to learn from others. And he talks about his own process which almost creepily mirrors my own of first finding solace in a whole bunch of self-help and psychology books and recognizing the authors of these books seem both very intelligent and also very compassionate. And he describes that as helping to grow his faith that there were adults out there in the world that which helped him make the leap into therapy. And then that therapeutic relationship helped him make the leap into forming healthier relationships in his life outside of therapy. And that's what I'm talking about. And I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point. And that is almost word for word the exact process that I went through as.",

    "text": "If they had, they would have done it, and you would not have developed the trauma symptoms that you developed. without further ado, we're going to get into 10 lessons it may have helped you to understand in childhood that you can now retroactively apply to your understanding of yourself if you grew up with complex PTSD. First lesson that I wish every person with CPTSD had known in childhood is that the neurotic behavior and emotional regulation strategies you almost definitely developed if you have complex PTSD are not character defects, they are trauma responses. if you have trouble with things eating disorders, substance abuse, social difficulties, obsessive thought patterns, chronically low self-esteem, all of these things and many other things that you may have been struggling with are not things that you chose. They are the mind and body's normal response to a set of abnormal circumstances. if you are missing some key element that you needed for healthy emotional development, your brain is going to do the best it can in order to help you self-regulate. And your brain's best attempt at self-regulation, if it doesn't have the tools to actually contextualize your emotions and make sense of what you are feeling and why, is going to be to develop things really rigid behavior patterns, addiction, anxiety, and depression. And if you're not able to do that, then you're not going to be able to do it. if you're not able to do it, then you're not going to be able to do it. And if you're not able to do it, then you're not going to be able to do it. All of those things are going to make it difficult to do things give yourself a sense of stability in life or to form healthy attachment relationships, because you simply did not learn enough of the necessary skills to do those things in the quote unquote normal way. But none of that was a choice, which is likely what you were led to believe growing up if you didn't have any context for why you were doing any of that. You probably learned, I am just doing all of this weird stuff and behaving in weird ways because I am a different flawed, wrong, broken person. But I'm going to say it one more time.",

This would have happened to anyone in your shoes. It is not something that you chose. the idea we're trying to get at here is that the toxic shame you feel is not as personal as you might think it is. It is the normal response to the life that you had, not a true reflection of the quality of your soul. Second thing you may never have learned if you have complex PTSD, that the average secure person actually intuitively knows. Is that it is almost impossible to concentrate when you are dysregulated. when you are in a fight, flight, freeze, or fawn response, your body is pumping blood to the areas of your brain that are designed to help you escape danger and stay alive. And those are not the parts of your brain that help you to focus deeply on details or on abstract thinking. But focusing on details and abstract thinking is a lot of what it is as we grow up it's a lot of what work entails as adults for most of us. And a lot of us who grew up with complex PTSD might be really, really hard on ourselves around the fact that we struggle much with focus when in reality, that is a normal response to being in chronic fight or flight mode.

Because a narcissist survives on control, they need to know they can trigger you, manipulate you, guilt you, shame you. The second you stop reacting the way they've trained you to, they don't just feel powerless, they feel irrelevant. And for a narcissist, irrelevance is worse than being hated. It's death to their ego. When you don't break, when you don't collapse, when you don't beg for their attention or explanation or apology, that's when everything starts to shift. You become the one thing they cannot handle, someone they no longer have access to emotionally, mentally, energetically. And that's when you become the one thing they cannot handle, someone they no longer have access to emotionally, mentally, energetically. You stop playing the role they wrote for you, and they don't know how to handle the new script. You become unpredictable, and to someone who relies on emotional predictability to stay in control, your clarity becomes a threat. Your silence becomes defiance. Your healing becomes resistance. They start cycling through their old tricks. One moment they're the victim, asking how you could be cold. The next, they're charming again. Pretending nothing ever happened. And when that doesn't work, they lash out. They tell lies. They twist stories. They look for new characters who will still play along. Because they can't stand watching you live without them. It's not love. It never was. It's possession. And when possession fails, they panic. You see, narcissists don't just want attention. They want ownership. Of your mind, your emotions, your decisions. And when they realize they no longer control how you feel about yourself, they start to unravel. Because they never knew you. They only knew the version of you they could control. The real you. The one who sets boundaries, who walks away, who doesn't explain every move, who no longer shrinks to keep the peace. That version terrifies them. That version reflects back everything they're not. Everything they pretended to be. Everything they tried to crush in you. Because they couldn't build it in themselves. They will say you changed. That you became selfish, distant, unrecognizable.

People are being taught methods that they say can cure people in eight sessions, which they can't. And there still is this, what people learn in school these days, although no good clinician I know actually practices that, is to help people's thinking out, to straighten out people's thinking and to make them not think these crazy thoughts. And there really is no evidence that we can do that. Is that cognitive behavioral therapy. , , cognitive restructuring sort of thing. Or that you can get people better by blasting them with trauma and then before long they get desensitized to a trauma. And I think both of these methods are just, they don't get it.

    "text": "people often underestimate the sheer gravity of boundaries psychological, emotional, spiritual, but when you're dealing with a narcissist boundaries aren't just protective mechanisms, they're weapons, not weapons of violence but of truth, of order, of identity. When dealing with a narcissist one of the most underestimated yet profoundly powerful tools at your disposal is the establishment and enforcement of boundaries. This isn't just a matter of asserting preferences or asking for space, no boundaries when properly understood and implemented are existential threats to the narcissistic personality structure. The narcissist's functions by crossing boundaries, by inserting themselves into every psychological, emotional, and even spiritual domain of your life. They feed on your openness, your empathy, your willingness to bend. Every time you say yes when you mean no, every time you tolerate behavior that goes against your better judgment, you make yourself more accessible to manipulation. The narcissist doesn't just notice this, they require it. The core pathology of narcissism isn't confidence, it's emptiness. A narcissist isn't full of themselves, they are void at the center. That void seeks identity through control and validation from others. when someone sets a firm boundary, it doesn't just irritate the narcissist, it disorients them. It reminds them, consciously or not, that they are not the same person. That they do not control everything. That their influence has limits. That their charm and tactics have a stopping point. And this is terrifying for them. Because if they can't manipulate you, they can't define themselves. Many people believe that fighting a narcissist means engaging in confrontation, calling them out, exposing their lies, countering their abuse with righteous indignation. While there may be moments where truth must be spoken directly, the real power comes from non-engagement. From detachment. From a calm, unmoved no. A boundary is not a war drum. It's a fortress wall. You don't need to scream to assert it. You just need to make it immovable. When you say, this is not acceptable, and you mean it, when your actions and reactions align with that truth, the narcissist loses their leverage. But here's the subtle danger. Narcissists are relentless. They will test your boundaries. They will attempt to wear you down. Not just through aggression, but through charm, guilt, and misdirection. They may suddenly play the victim. They may flatter you. They may act as though they understand. As though they've changed.",

    "text": "All in a ploy to get back inside the gate. This is why boundaries must not only be set, they must be guarded. Continuously. Unapologetically. And the moment you waver even slightly, the narcissist will see it as an opening. A crack in the armor. And they will exploit it without hesitation. One of the reasons boundaries are potent is because they reverse the dynamic. And they take the narcissist out of the position of control and force them to adapt to your reality, your terms. It is deeply unsettling for them. Because they are no longer orchestrating the emotional environment. You're no longer giving them emotional cues they can exploit. In fact, the more emotionally unreactive you are, the more power you hold. You're not validating their existence. You're not feeding the drama. And in doing , you are drying up their primary source of supply. What most people fail to recognize is that boundaries are not about changing the narcissist. They're about protecting and preserving the self. This is critical. You do not set boundaries to reform the abuser. You do it because you recognize your worth. You do it because you understand that enabling dysfunction, even passively, is a form of self-betrayal. And when you stop betraying yourself, the narcissist experiences it as a betrayal of them. In truth, you've just withdrawn your consent to be used. Boundaries are more than psychological lines. They are declarations of who you are and what you value. They define the terms of engagement in every relationship. And when enforced with integrity, they reveal the narcissist's weakness. That without control over others, they have nothing. They are nothing. Your boundaries, therefore, don't just frustrate the narcissist. They expose them. They show the world and themselves how little they actually possess. Indifference is more than just a form of self-betrayal. Indifference is more than just a form of self-betrayal. And the narcissist is more powerful than confrontation when dealing with a narcissist. And this is something most people don't realize until they've exhausted themselves in the cycle of arguing, explaining, defending, and trying to be understood. The instinct to confront, to force accountability, comes from a place of wanting fairness, justice, or clarity. But narcissists are not operating in a moral or rational framework. They are not seeking truth. They are seeking control.",

    "text": "In fact, it's often more powerful when it's steady, unemotional, and consistent. You don't have to argue to reveal the truth. You just have to stop pretending. You stop agreeing with lies. Stop playing along with distortions. Stop participating in the script they've written. And once you do that, the illusion begins to crack under the pressure of reality. Self-respect forces them into psychological dependence. A narcissist thrives in relationships where the other person lacks a strong sense of identity, where boundaries are loose, and where validation is given freely and without expectation of reciprocity. When they encounter someone who does not prioritize their own worth, who consistently compromises to maintain peace or gain approval, they recognize an opportunity. That person becomes a source of narcissistic supply, easily manipulated, emotionally available, and dependent on the narcissist's ever-shifting approval. But the moment that dynamic shifts, when the person begins to develop self-respect, the narcissist finds themselves destabilized. They are no longer the ones setting the tone, dictating the narrative, or defining the value of the relationship. Self-respect is not loud, but it is powerful. It shows itself in quiet refusals, in subtle changes in tone, in the decision to no longer tolerate certain behaviors. It manifests in someone walking away from conversations that go nowhere, in ending up in a relationship that is not in the same order as the other. It is a constant change in the way that you interact with people, in creating arguments that are circular, in declining invitations to chaos. When you respect yourself, you change the rules of engagement. You stop begging for understanding, and instead operate from a place of internal certainty. And this shift throws the narcissist into psychological disarray. They are used to people orienting themselves around them, their moods, their reactions, their expectations. They are then centered in their own values. And from that center, they make choices that reflect their worth. This newfound internal stability becomes a mirror for the narcissist. It reflects back what they lack. True self-possession, inner discipline, authentic confidence. Instead of controlling you, they now feel controlled by your clarity. They begin to feel the pressure of your standards. They know they can't lie without consequence, manipulate without resistance. Or play victim without being seen for what they are. This dynamic is incredibly uncomfortable for them, because it flips the power balance.",

They become obsessed with it, not because they admire it in a healthy way, but because they don't know what it is. They become obsessed with it, but because they don't understand it. It confuses them, frustrates them, and challenges their deeply held belief that everyone is vulnerable to their influence. This is not the kind of power they're used to encountering. It doesn't seek validation. It doesn't engage in ego games. It doesn't crumble under pressure. And , the narcissist begins to revolve around this strength a satellite around a planet, trying to figure out how to regain the upper hand, but failing, again. This failure breeds dependency. The narcissist becomes psychologically and emotionally attached to the person they can't break. They begin to mirror that person's behaviors, adopt their language, and even alter their tone and presentation in order to maintain proximity. They want to absorb the strength they see, but cannot replicate. It becomes an unconscious form of enslavement. They need what they cannot control. The very boundaries that once frustrated them become the framework they return to. The very boundaries that once frustrated them become the framework they return to. The very boundaries that once frustrated them become the framework they return to. They stay not because they are loved in the way they understand love, but because they are held in place by something stronger than manipulation. Presence. The narcissist's dependency on unshakable strength is not mutual. That strength does not need the narcissist. It is not seeking validation, love, or even change from them. It exists independently, and that is the core of its power. The narcissist, who cannot generate such autonomy within themselves, begins to cling to the structure it offers. But because they have not earned it, and because they cannot control it, the relationship becomes one-sided. The narcissist becomes a servant to a truth they do not understand and cannot distort. They follow, but not out of love, out of necessity, out of fear of being cast back into the chaos of their own emotional emptiness. This dynamic is deeply unsettling for the narcissist.

    "text": "You would remain soft, naive, and unprepared for the deeper trials that life inevitably brings. The pain inflicted by a narcissist confronts you with the darkness that exists not only in the world but within yourself. The parts of you that tolerate abuse, that crave validation, that have their own worth in the desperate hope of being loved. Without this confrontation, these vulnerabilities remain hidden, silently sabotaging your future. To suffer is to be initiated into a higher state of awareness. Pain compels honesty. It demands that you admit what you have avoided seeing. Every tear, every sleepless night, every moment of self-doubt carves a deeper space within you for strength, wisdom, and compassion to eventually take root. If you are merely enduring cruelty, you are being forged in the fire of necessary trials. Just as steel must be subjected to intense heat to become strong, too must the soul be tested through suffering to achieve its fullest form. It is tempting to cling to victimhood, to see oneself solely as a casualty of another's pathology. But this perspective, while emotionally satisfying in the short term, ultimately robs you of the power inherent in your experience. You are not just surviving the narcissist, but you are also being unwell-welcome, prepared to see more clearly, to love more wisely, to lead with greater authority, to stand in your own truth without apology. The pain, unwelcome though it may be, is sculpting you into someone capable of carrying a far heavier weight, someone who can be entrusted with greater responsibility, deeper purpose, and a more profound impact on the lives of others. Suffering isolates you at first, but in that isolation, you are forced to meet yourself honestly, stripped of illusions, stripped of easy comforts. You stand face to face with your own soul. It is in these crucibles that character is born. Narcissists in all their brokenness unwittingly serve as the architects of your strength. They expose your wounds, not to destroy you, but to drive you toward healing profound that your former self would scarcely recognize who you are becoming. Most people walk through life unaware of the subtle cracks in their psychological armor. These cracks, old wounds, resolve fears, desperate needs for approval, remain hidden, concealed beneath the distractions of daily life.",

    "text": "And what breaks first are the illusions you have wrapped around yourself for protection. The realization that you were vulnerable all along can be humbling, even humiliating, but it is also liberating. Because once you see where you are weak, you can finally begin the sacred work of becoming strong. The narcissist exposes more than just your weaknesses, they expose the coping mechanisms you developed to survive earlier traumas. People pleasing, self-silencing, denial of your own anger or hurt. These strategies may have kept you safe in the past, but now they leave you wide open to exploitation. This revelation is painful, but it is also a map. It shows you exactly where healing must occur. It points directly to the work that must be done if you are to rise above not only this relationship, but any future challenge that life will inevitably bring. Chaos is not just disorder in the world around you. It is the internal confusion that arises when your values your needs and your instincts are all pulled in different directions at once. When you are placed in the path of a narcissist, you are thrown into a state of deep emotional and psychological chaos. What once seemed clear becomes distorted. Words are twisted, intentions are questioned, and you find yourself unsure of your own mind. It is within this chaos that the seeds of true boundaries are planted. Because without chaos, there would be no urgency, no necessity to define where you stand and what you will no longer allow. A moment ago, most people assumed they have boundaries simply because they have preferences or ideals. But real boundaries are not theoretical. They are forged in conflict, tested by pressure, and strengthened through adversity. A narcissist challenges your ability to say no, your willingness to assert your needs, your to exist independently of someone else's manipulative agenda. You quickly discover that without clear boundaries, you are not simply accommodating someone else, you are eroding your own soul piece by piece. The more you surrender, the more the chaos grows until you are left hollowed out, unsure of who you even are. This profound disorientation is not a failure. It is the beginning of the awakening. You do not truly know your boundaries until they are tested. You do not know how much disrespect you will tolerate until you are bathed in it daily.",

You found yourself within dysfunctional relationships because you recreated the initial original dynamics within your family of origin. But before we go there, there are two types of family mobbing. Insidious and overt. The insidious type is hidden. It's occult. It's obscure. It's subtle. It's difficult to convince outsiders that something bad is happening within the family unit. The overt type is visible. There is physical abuse. Sexual abuse. Verbal abuse. Psychological abuse. Or perhaps the other end of the spectrum. There's parentifying. Instrumentalizing. Smothering and spoiling. Overprotectiveness. But in any case, these are visible. Ostensible. Not to say ostentatious signs of family dysfunction. The insidious type is visible. The overt type is visible. The insidious type is much more onerous. Much more difficult. Because it does not allow you to communicate to the outside. No one would believe you.",

We are stuck flinging between those five main symptoms. For example, with emotional flashbacks. Because the trauma is somewhere still alive and stuck in our body, our body is always on hyper alert. And we are stuck in that hyper alert. And we are stuck in that hyper alert. And we are stuck in that hyper alert. And we are overreacting. We are depending on our trauma response, whether it's fight, flight, freeze, or fawn. We're either in a highly active fight response where we get angry really quick. A flight response where we're doing, doing, doing we don't feel. A fawn response where we are appeasing everybody to try to establish some means of safety. Or a freeze response where we just feel stuck. And we think that's a trauma response. And we think that's a trauma response. And we think that's a trauma response. Because that's who we are,. That becomes our personality. But it's not our personality. That's our trauma responses that are stuck. Very much a car, a manual car. If the gears get stuck, there might be nothing wrong with the car, except that the stick shift needs fixing. , it's the same thing with us. As a person, we are fine. We really are. And I know if you're resonating with what narcissistic abuse does to you, you do not feel fine. And I get it. because I didn't feel fine either. But as I worked through the journey, I realized that I was fine underneath all those layers of trauma and what the trauma did and the personality and the coping skills that I developed because of the trauma. And recovery wasn't about getting a new me because there was nothing wrong with the me that I was. It was really about unlearning all those layers that the trauma created and working through those coping skills that I could get back to who I really was. I hope that makes sense.",

It's one thing to laugh about the past moments in a fun and loving way, but this may be the case if you're not a fan of the past. But this may be the case if you're not a fan of the past. This may quickly become emotional abuse when you go out of your way to humiliate them as a way of punishment or reminder that you are the one in control in your relationship. Humiliating someone in front of people or when they've asked for you to stop can be incredibly damaging for their mental and emotional -being. Number four, you to push buttons. Did that constantly doing and saying things to get others to react is also a form of emotional abuse. Doing unpredictable things to keep the other person from doing the same thing that you're doing to the person on their toes can be a form of emotional abuse. Instead of being spontaneous to do things you both enjoy, you may use this unpredictable tactic to say or do things to purposefully anger and upset them, especially in front of other people. This may include broadcasting a secret they told you in confidants or making social media posts that will trigger them. Number five, you tell people their version of reality is wrong. Have you ever dismissed someone's experience as imagined. Gaslighting is a psychological term for negating someone else's reality and it involves intentionally using someone's words, feelings or actions against them. The goal is to completely discredit anything the other person has to say that the abuser can maintain control over the narrative. This may include telling them they are crazy, accusing them of lying or making decisions for them without their input. Number six, you use your emotions to get people to do what you want. Have you intentionally made someone feel guilty just to get your way. Expressing your emotions can be great for your mental health.

    "text": "Because when a person refuses to grow, to self-reflect, or to take ownership of their life, they become consumed by resentment. And resentment, left unchecked, doesn't just mean that they're not happy. They're not happy. It's an instant. They're a victim of self-item. Or they're a victim of their own ignorance. This is why narcissists have lost control. They're just running out of time. That's the crux of it. , number 4. Less Charm. More Control. As narcissists age, one of the most subtle but dangerous shifts you'll observe is this. The charm begins to fade. And control takes its place. That magnetic personality, that lively energy they once used to captivate a room, it doesn't last forever. Time, as always, is relentless. The looks fade. The looks fade. The stamina dwindles. If you have a healthy personality, you will never lose control. The influence weakens, and what's left is someone still desperately trying to dominate their environment, but now with fewer tools. See, when a narcissist is young or at the height of their power, they don't need to control you obviously. Their charm is covert manipulation. They get what they want through flattery, seduction, performance. But charm is expensive. It requires energy, effort, and an audience that still believes the act. As age strips that away, they grow impatient, and the manipulation becomes less veiled, more forceful, less finesse, more force. They begin to coerce rather than persuade. Guilt replaces charisma. They'll use silence, passive aggression, emotional outbursts, or shame to get what they want. Why. Because charm was never about connection. It was about control. And now, stripped of the disguise, they reveal the core strategy dominance is. At any cost, control becomes a survival tactic. Not just psychologically, but existentially. Remember, the narcissist's identity is fragile, built on the validation of others. When people stop admiring them voluntarily, the narcissist doesn't let go, they tighten their grip. They demand loyalty. They insist on respect. They manipulate with stories, with health crises, with fear. And in doing , they damage relationships irreparably. What's most tragic. And dangerous. Is that the more control they try to assert, the more people pull away. They become tyrants in their own homes. They become emotionally unsafe. Children distance themselves. Partners grow resentful. Friends drift. But instead of asking why, the narcissist doubles down. They're ungrateful, they say. They turned on me.",

Anything to keep the spotlight from dimming. This behavior isn't just annoying. It's deeply revealing. What you're witnessing is a person whose ego is on life support. They are emotionally malnourished. They cannot generate a stable sense of self internally, they siphon it from others. It's parasitic. And as they age, and their circle shrinks, they often grow more manipulative to retain whatever scraps of admiration they can find. Think of it this way. Most people age by shifting their values. They begin to find meaning in contribution. In legacy. In spiritual depth. But the narcissist remains fixated on appearance. Not physical appearance alone, but the appearance of significance. They don't want to be meaningful. They want to appear meaningful. It's not about actual impact. It's about perceived impact. they fabricate it. Amplify it. And when that doesn't work, they don't want to be seen. They don't want to be seen. And when that doesn't work, they spiral. And this obsession with validation eventually breeds deep resentment. Because the world stops applauding. It moves on. And the narcissist, who has built no true self, is left scrambling for recognition that no longer comes. They blame others. They're jealous. Disloyal. Ungrateful. They reinterpret the silence of others as evidence of a conspiracy. But it's not a conspiracy. It's consequence. They failed to cultivate something real within themselves. And now they're paying for it. What's worse is that the people around them suffer. Loved ones are pulled into a constant performance, where their only role is to affirm the narcissist's illusion. There's no room for authenticity. No room for conflict. For real intimacy. For growth. Because growth requires discomfort. And the narcissist will not tolerate discomfort, especially if it threatens the image they've worked hard to preserve. they pressure. They guilt trip. They expect applause for basic decency. They take offense when others have needs. Every conversation, every gathering becomes an opportunity to be seen, not to connect. The narcissist doesn't relate. They broadcast. And those who refuse to play along are punished. Emotionally, sometimes financially, always psychologically. In the end their life becomes smaller. Not because they are less valuable. But because their need to be valued overrides their ability to actually build value. Relationships dry up.",

    "text": "It's a mask that's not just a mask. It shatters the person holding it. For many aging narcissists, this collapse manifests externally. You'll see it in financial recklessness, spending far beyond their means to maintain an illusion of success. Or in addiction, substance abuse, gambling, escapism, anything to numb the reality they've refused to confront. Or in serial, failed relationships, each one ending in blame, in chaos, in accusations, because intimacy, threatens the mask nothing else. Why does this happen. Because when you've built your identity entirely on how others see you, you're standing on a fault line. It's not real. It has no foundation. And eventually, the strain of maintaining the illusion exceeds the strength of the ego beneath it. The narcissist finds themselves unable to hold it all together. The stories, the performances, the manipulations, it starts to unravel. And when it does, the result is not graceful, surrender, and self-destruction. It's a mask that's not just a mask. It's a mask that's not just a mask. It's a mask that's not just a mask. It's a mask that's not just a mask. It's a mask that's not just a mask. A breakdown. Emotional, relational, even physical. Rage gives way to despair. Grandiosity gives way to paranoia. Control gives way to chaos. You'll see the once confident voice tremble. The assertive posture slump. The untouchable image crack and fragment. But perhaps the most painful part, they still try to hold the mask in place. Even as it falls apart. Even as people walk away. Even as the evidence is not yet there. People who want to take it all away. People who want to take it all away. evidence piles up, because admitting the mask was false means admitting they were false. And that kind of realization can be psychologically annihilating. Some become reclusive, haunted by the ghosts of their former selves. Others lash out more violently. Anything to preserve the last fragments of the illusion. But the truth is unavoidable. They've become a victim of the very persona they created. And the world they built to reflect their false identity now stands in ruin.

I go, what happens if your little child fell off their bike and messed stuff up. I would be in that child's face, criticizing them, calling them down. here's what I want you to understand. You parent your biological child differently than you parent yourself. You're loving and nurturing and comforting and understanding to your biological children because what shame-based parenting did to you. But yet when you parent yourself, you still use shame-based parenting. People don't grow from shame or heal from shame until they parent themselves in a loving, nurturing way. And that starts with that little part of you that you've always been embarrassed by. let me just read this. It came out recently. I found it. It says, Toxic shame has its root in childhood, abandonment, abuse, and trauma. And you're familiar with all that. As such, feeling better will almost always go back to accessing your childhood self, the very part of you that was confronted with the trauma in the first place. Learning how to interact with and care for your younger self is called inner child work. And there are a number of reasons why this practice is powerful. Firstly, inner child work helps you access feelings that you have repressed and disassociated from in an attempt to protect yourself as a child. By re-experiencing these emotions, you'll be able to release them from your body and mind and generate deep healing. you connect emotionally. Secondly, inner child work is tremendously insightful and revealing. Often some of the most important questions you've carried consciously or subconsciously are answered while doing inner child work. And thirdly, inner child work is learning self-compassion in action. When you learn how to re-parent your inner child, you develop a deep, strong connection with yourself, which has a ripple effect on the rest of your life. what's inner child work. It's learning to re-parent yourself, learning to parent yourself with compassion, learning to stop beating up and rejecting and abandoning yourself. Final point, number 19. Be patient. It takes time. If you forget what you are doing or start playing something else, then losing it is the same as breaking up with yourself.",

    "text": "And that is to me part of the huge negative effect of complex trauma as it spreads beyond the person into relationships. , let me begin with a basic definition. And this isn't mine. Kind of from a textbook point. And then I'm going to over the next weeks just start coming at it from all kinds of different angles. And if me, we're going to come at it from at least 20 different angles in order to get a better and better understanding of this thing called codependency. a basic definition says a codependent relationship involves one person supporting or trying to solve the other person's problems. it's all about people trying to solve each other's problems, meet their needs mainly their self-esteem needs and their emotional needs. That's part one. Part two, what that means then is that one person or both person but mainly one person becomes ends up becoming an enabler of the other person's unhealthy behavior. you're trying to support them but what you're supporting is them being immature and irresponsible and you're cleaning up their mess after them trying to solve their problems and fix them but you're giving them permission to never grow up. And you end up with relationships that are much a parent and a child. And they drive you crazy. And you are supporting unhealthy people. Healthy behaviors, not healthy behaviors. And then what happens with that is the enabler becomes totally occupied with solving the other person's problems and trying to meet their needs that they totally lose track of their own needs. And they are living without their own needs being met and they don't even know how to meet their own needs. they're dying inside trying to give life to somebody else who doesn't want life. And that is the disaster that comes out of co-dependency gradually. what you're going to see is co-dependency is addiction. It gradually gets worse and worse and worse and those in it get sicker and sicker and sicker. the longer you stay in a co-dependent relationship the worse you get, the worse they get and the sicker you both get and everybody around you. And that is the basic definition. I say there's a couple things about addiction that therefore are involved with co-dependency. Number one, co-dependency can be you're addicted to a person. they're your crack pipe.",

And you become addicted to them. the addiction, even when it gets to the point that your crack pipe is no longer giving you positive experiences but is only making your life a living you can't let go. And the same is true in co-dependency. This person is becoming more and more toxic and destroying you. But can you get rid of them. -. You're addicted to them. And that is the first part. Second part, it's also you're addicted to an unhealthy way of relating even a destructive way of relating. it's an addiction to a relationship style that isn't healthy. And that's what we're going to be developing over time. But here's what I want you to see. If you look at the necessary ingredients for a healthy relationship, honesty, trust, respect, you don't find those in co-dependency. the very thing necessary, the very ingredients necessary for a healthy relationship, what happens in a co-dependent relationship, you're trying to have a healthy relationship without those ingredients. And it's impossible. But people will keep trying. The third thing that I think is a great summary statement is co-dependency, is how a shame-based person approaches relationships. And that's what I want to develop now in helping you get the core explanation and understanding of what co-dependency is. let me take you back to a simple definition of complex trauma that you may never have thought of before. Complex trauma always happens in a situation, usually home, where the person with the most power is a narcissist. And they make it all about them. they want everything to go the way they want it to go. They want everybody to respond to their needs, to their emotions, to their wants, and they want everybody's life to revolve around them. That's what creates complex trauma because now that person who's the narcissist abuses the people that don't do the stuff that they want. It neglects people because it's all preoccupied with its own needs. And it abandons people to pursue its own selfish pursuits. complex trauma always takes place with a narcissist in power.",

To stay safe physically, you don't talk, you don't feel, you don't trust. You don't do the things necessary for a healthy relationship. complex trauma, the need for safety squashes healthy out of a child. Now in adult life, you come into relationships and you don't know how to do healthy. You still operate by don't trust, don't talk, be dishonest, lie. All of those things are there. the very strategies necessary to survive as a child make healthy relationships impossible. here's an important summary for you. Codependency develops in an emotionally abusive environment with a narcissist being abusive. And it develops in an emotionally dishonest environment because the enabler is never going to get honest about how things really are. And a child is growing up in an environment that is emotionally abusive and emotionally dishonest. how are they going to learn to be emotionally honest and emotionally healthy. They didn't have that taught to them, they set that aside in their life. here's a quote that I love. Soul wounds, again, emotional wounds are what take place in an emotionally abusive environment. Soul wounds do not heal if ignored. And what I want you to understand with that is a lot of people coming out of complex trauma say, why deal with that. That's in the past. And what this is saying is you can ignore those wounds, but it's still going to mess up your relationships today. soul wounds do not heal if you ignore them. They continue to shape and govern our emotions, our self-image, our ways of interacting in relationship long beyond the childhood in which they were received. Shame does damage far beyond the original dysfunction because it has damaged the wounded souls unintentionally, continually. They continue to perpetrate on themselves. It is a kind of soul murder. What it's saying is this. If you don't deal with your soul wounds, guess what. You're going to get in relationships and you're going to wound yourself. And you're going to murder your own soul. And in other words, what it is saying is complex trauma, you develop a system that lets you survive physically, but it murders your soul. You're physically alive, soul dead.

Another person has said, codependency is using relationships today to try and meet emotional needs not met in childhood. I said to the clients this week, what many of you will probably find is you're going to wake up one morning and you say, I think I married my mom or I think I married my dad. Because I'm still looking for them to validate me and meet my needs today. I married somebody that was them without realizing it, hoping they would solve my soul wounds. And they won't. They will just make it worse. an attempt to heal one's shame by ignoring your internal world and focusing on finding Mr. Perfect does not work.

But we've been really focusing on what does it mean to have a relationship with. What does it mean to trust. What's this living by in.

They don't have to justify their no. They can just say no. But practice saying no. Practice setting boundaries. Now I need to say that when you say no and set boundaries you're probably your initial internal response is you're going to feel guilty. You're going to feel that you're selfish. You might even then get accused by those in your family who are used to you being a people pleaser. They're going to accuse you now of being selfish. They're going to even accuse you of being a narcissist. And that's where you need a healthy person that's going to come and say no. You're not selfish. You're not a narcissist.

If you're in a relationship with them, the only way they can be convinced that they're the son of the universe is that there's nobody else in the universe but you. they get rid of all your friends, they get rid of your family, and they demand your full attention.

Without them, jealousy kicks in, and they get really cruel when jealousy kicks in, and their control issues go up a notch. Extreme sensitivity and a tendency to be easily hurt, to feel rejected over the slightest little things. if you're with a healthy person, it takes a lot to really make them feel hurt by something that you might do.

Who belittled them and abused them and put them down and was cruel to them nonstop. And the only way the child could survive was to become a narcissist. And it is an extreme response to extreme cruel treatment. And that is the birthplace of narcissists. , let me end with this. those are the 18 characteristics. Now there's three different types of narcissists. number one is the one we normally think of, which is an exhibitionist narcissist. that's the person who's outgoing and is always talking about how wonderful they are, their great dreams, their great accomplishments, and letting how wonderful they are. We're all familiar with that.",

    "text": "Last week we started a new series on boundaries and hopefully it gave you an understanding of what they are. Today I want to take you a little bit further. But just to recap, boundaries, we talked about internal boundaries, that's the rules I have for myself. External boundaries are how close I let people into my life. Those are there, healthy boundaries are there for the purpose of helping me get healthy and protecting me from different things. What I want to look at today is how complex trauma greatly affects people's boundaries, understanding how they use boundaries, difficulties in setting healthy boundaries. for a person coming out of a fairly healthy home, boundaries they quickly. get and they've lived with healthy boundaries. But for people coming out of complex trauma, there's a whole new level that you need to understand as to how difficult boundaries can be. And I hope you saw last week that if you don't get healthy boundaries, you don't get healthy but you don't make it in recovery. I want you to understand how complex trauma affects boundaries, how it messes people. And I hope you'll be able to follow up when it comes to having boundaries in their life today. I think the first thing that is important to understand is that complex trauma is all about unhealthy boundaries. People in complex trauma have lots of boundaries. They might not be aware that they have those boundaries, but they have them. They're just not healthy. let me give you an idea of how that works. What we've seen in the past is that for complex trauma families, which are also referred to as dysphagia, or dysfunctional families, the idea is it's families that are in pain. They create pain, and also they're not able to resolve the pain that's been created. And people have to find ways of coping with this unresolved pain. And that sets up all kinds of coping strategies that seem to work, that take away the pain, but actually are making things worse. those strategies of dealing with unresolved pain are actually the ones that are most important. And they're actually rules or boundaries that they live by.",

    "text": "for example, boundary number one, or rule number one, is if the authority figure of the home is the one causing the pain and not resolving it, then to lessen pain or not have as much pain, do whatever the authority wants. Never challenge them. Never annoy them. Let them have their way. And that will take away some pain. The point is it takes it away in the immediate circumstances, but it doesn't resolve it. It just piles it up for later in life. A second rule is never show emotions that the authority figure finds annoying. Because if you show those emotions, then they're going to get mad at you and punish you, and that will increase your pain. Third, don't talk about your problems. Don't talk about your needs. Don't talk about what's wrong with the family. And the issues that the family needs to face. Because if you do, you're going to get punished and hurt. that's just three very simple basic boundaries that exist within a complex trauma family. they seem to work, but something's happening that is very harmful. First of all, the needs of the people in the family aren't being met. And because of all of this unresolved pain and how it's being dealt with, there's things happening inside of the child and the people in the family that are creating greater and greater negative emotions. They have more shame, more guilt, more anger, even depression and anxiety. It's building inside. And all of that, they don't have a solution for. It's unresolved. And you get this growing, accumulating amount of pain that is happening. And that's why we're talking about the trauma family. And I think that's a very important point that we should all be thinking about. Because trauma families are not just about the emotional pain that's happening in each family member. And it will come out later in life and not in a good way. let me give you some general approaches that complex trauma families take to boundaries. And some of you will relate to one extreme or another or a blend of them. You can have no rules. Just do whatever you want. Just don't bug me. Or you have rules that are very unreasonable. Rules that are rigid. There's no bend. There's no compromise. It's my way or the highway.",

    "text": "And that can cause a lot of pain, but a lot of anger as. Next one, how the rules were enforced. violation of rules or violation of boundaries needs to have built in consequences. That's the design. that when a child steps into telling a lie or in doing stuff that's hurtful to others, there needs to be a consequence. they learn quickly that behavior is not healthy and it will ruin you and your relationship. And that's the design. that's the design. that's the design. And that's the design. that's the design. that's the design. that's the design. If you don't change that. the pain of the consequences is to be appropriate to the crime, and then it's to motivate the child to live a healthy life. it's to be fair. It's to be what's best for the child. It's always around a moral issue that is violated, that there's a negative consequence. Within complex trauma families, it's not always that. In fact, it's seldom that in some families. what they find, is fear is the way to motivate the children to live inside mom and dad's rules, what mom and dad want. if a child comes home and they've been drinking for the first time, mom and dad might use fear, and instead of saying, you're playing with fire or what's going on with you, is this just an innocent experimental thing, and explore it, they go, you're going to end up an addict. I'm going to take you downtown and I'm going to let you see people living on the street. As a ruby, that you see where you're headed. And it's over the top, an exaggerated horror show, trying to scare them straight. The problem with that, is it might work for a little while, but over time, the children begin to realize that this is just an exaggerated horror show, and it actually begins to turn them off. The next thing that some families do, to try and motivate their children to live by the rules, is if they step outside of the rules, they get shamed, they get put down, they get made fun of, they get called names, they get told they're a failure, a loser, they'll never amount to anything. And parents hope that the pain of the shame will make them want to change their behavior. Initially, that might work.",

    "text": "A lot of people coming out of complex trauma what they have found in their families is that everybody's into everybody's business they're very enmeshed or everybody's totally isolated. Nobody talks to each other. And part, if you've been in enmeshed relationships within your family and now as an adult you get into a relationship with somebody the fear can be if I let you into my life now I'm responsible to make you happy all the time. I'm responsible for your emotions. I'm responsible to fix your anger when you explode. I have to fix it when you're sad. And you think a relationship means I have to become a parent to this other person. Or if I'm in a relationship with you I can never say no to you. I have to do whatever you want. I have to serve you and really become a slave to you. Or if I get in a relationship with you I have to know and read and anticipate every need that you might have. I have to be a mind reader. I have to be able to see all of your cues I know what you're wanting without you having to ask. now I have to develop super powers to read and know your needs and wants if I am going to have a relationship with you. What that means for people is if I get in a relationship with you I will lose me. Because my life now will be understanding your emotions, not mine. Understanding your needs, not mine. Understanding your thinking, not mine. I don't know where I end and you begin anymore. I lose me in you. And then some people even think that if you get into a committed romantic relationship that the other person totally owns you. You lose any say, any will. You can't stand up for yourself. You can't express needs. They own you. And that usually leads to great abuse. All because of bad boundaries. One other thing that enmeshed families do is deep down they know there's not a lot of healthy intimacy in the family. they say we're close because we do lots of stuff together. We never talk at a deep level. But because we have fun constantly together that proves that we are a very healthy close family.",

They were a physical body in a room, but they were not there emotionally unavailable. , most of you can relate to that one. But then there's the abuse of father or mother. And , they abuse you verbally, emotionally, psychologically, sexually, physically. Some of you went through that. Then there's the pampering father or mother. And , they didn't set boundaries for you. They spoiled you, treated you a princess, let you away with stuff, just gave you. gift after gift, no rules, indulged you. Some of you had that. Then there's the toxic father or mother. And that's the one who's just controlling, domineering. They want to be enmeshed with you and involved in everything you do to control it.

And the child is constantly getting their hopes up and then going through the anguish of dashed hopes and being let down. , what I want you to see is every one of those parent types has a narcissistic element.

The child who has that type of parent basically thinks it's their fault. And then they develop a core identity that says, I'm not good enough. I'm not lovable. Something's wrong with me. I'm a failure. And they develop this negative core identity. They also usually carry a ton of false guilt. Believing it is their fault that things aren't working out with their parents even though the child has done nothing wrong. Most end up with anxiety issues. They're walking on eggshells all the time.

And depression becomes a part of it. Then they have boundary issues. They don't know how to set healthy boundaries. They don't know what healthy boundaries are. And they let people use them, abuse them, walk all over them. Or they're too rigid in their boundaries. They just isolate. all kinds of boundary things come out of that.

In that crisis moment when they're triggered. And we call that grounding. And that's where people can use rhythm. They can do breathing, rhythmic breathing. They can walk. They can listen to music. They can tap on pressure points, which is called EFP. Some people count. Some people draw. Color. Rhythm. They can find rhythms that help regulate them. what I want you to know. And understand is the starting point for dealing with emotional regulation is not tools for the cortex. Because it's not yet engaged. It's tools to ground, to de-escalate the limbic system. And rhythm is a big part of that. Then once regulated, you can go to the cortex. And as you go to the cortex, then you can tell time again. And you go, what. What just happened felt 40 years ago. But I'm not there 40 years ago. Even though it feels it's still happening to me. And then you can go, what happened here. And you can reprocess the event. And reprocess the trauma. And learn from it. And healing will happen as you do that. Then the third is you don't want to just be living with grounding tools. For when you're triggered. What you want to do is start healing your stress system. that it isn't triggered as much. that it gets to a healthier place. That can better handle stress and triggering events. And what are tools to help develop an increasingly healthy stress response system. Yoga, for many people, does that. Running, pet therapy, art therapy. All are helpful. But more than that, you have to begin to learn to meet your 12 needs consistently. And you have to begin connecting with safe people. Again, the three ingredients now have to become part of your life. Not just when you're in a crisis. Then the fourth thing is you have to go back and heal those wounds. And those wounds won't heal. Unless. You talk about them. Face them. Get honest about them. Bring them to your conscious level.",

    "text": ", welcome to another Friday night. I want to talk tonight about a part of complex trauma called trauma bonding that is beginning to be understood better and better, but to me it's such an important part in understanding complex trauma. And I really hope this helps you because I think a lot of people who are understanding that they have complex trauma haven't quite pieced together this trauma bonding part yet. What I have found is that two definitions have kind of developed for trauma bonding. One is accurate and one is not. the inaccurate one goes this. Let's say you're in trauma recovery and you get in a group of other people in trauma recovery and you start sharing your stories and you go, wow, they've got similar trauma to me. I just connect with them. And you really start building a good relationship because you're talking about this very open, real, vulnerable stuff. And you go, that must be a trauma bond. We're bonding around our trauma. That's technically not a trauma bond. A trauma bond is the bond that takes place exclusively in abusive relationships. What you're experiencing in that recovery situation is actually healthy bonding or the beginning of healthy bonding. Because you're bonding around a subject, one subject only at first, but it allows you to be open, vulnerable, real, authentic. The key to understand is this. That's the beginning of bonding. For true intimacy to develop, you have to grow beyond just connecting around one topic to beginning to talk openly and honestly about other topics until you're able to talk about everything. And bonding always begins on one topic, healthy bonding, and then it grows. the fact that you're bonding around healing your trauma, fantastic, but that's not trauma bonding. Let me give you the definition of trauma bonding. A trauma bond develops when a narcissistic abuser uses coercive control to make you believe you need the abuser's care and validation to feel sufficient. You become highly dependent on the abuser's care and validation to feel sufficient. You become highly dependent on the abusive relationship, whether it's romantic or family, friends or work related. In other words, you're in a relationship with somebody that's neglecting you or abusing you, but you develop this connection to them and you feel affection for them.",

    "text": "You feel dependent on them, even though they're neglecting and abusing you. And it's a bond that has both feelings of love and feelings of fear. it's not a healthy bond, but it is a bond. Trauma bonding is a psychological response where a person forms a strong emotional attachment to someone who is causing them harm. That's the key. Often through cycles of abuse, manipulation or power imbalances, it's especially common in abusive relationships, whether emotional, physical or psychological. it's that weird connection and affection that develops with somebody that's actually hurting you. And we're going to look at why that happens. let me add to this. The term trauma bond describes how feelings of fear, excitement and sex can manipulate, trap or entangle another person. what you see there is there's scary feelings, exciting feelings, sexual feelings, all of them draw you into a web where you feel connected to another person, but actually you're entangled, you're trapped. periods of intense love and excitement, followed by episodes of abuse, neglect and mistreatment, create a corrupt attachment through intermittent reinforcement in the cycle of abuse to an abusive person. There are enough good days to entice you, enough bad days to confuse you, and enough enablers to put forth their fake persona. you get drawn into a cycle that's got enough good stuff happening that you tolerate the bad stuff and you feel connected to the person. The shorter the length of time between when they show their Jekyll and Hyde sides, the stronger the trauma bond. The longer the span between these ups and downs, the harder they are to detect. And the longer the relationship, which is worse in many ways because it robs you of most precious commodity. Jekyll and Hyde, good and bad. If you go through lots of abuse but you get a good time, that cycle happens very quickly, then that means the relationship's probably been going on for a while and that means the trauma bond is very strong. When there's a long gap between when the bad stuff happens but there's a lot of good stuff, you stay in it. You stay in it. You stay in it. A lot longer, and you waste a lot of time.

And I never want to go back there, but why did they go back into abusive relationships and create trauma bonds again with abusive people. what I want you to understand is think of that child in a home of complex trauma, is there's a whole bunch of different factors that play into this whole thing. number one, not only is there a lot of trauma, but there's a whole bunch of factors that play into this whole thing. number two, we don't outgrow that drive to connect. We don't outgrow that drive to connect. There's something in us, even as adults, that is still driven to connect, to connect with people, to connect with activities that give pleasure, to connect with beauty that gives pleasure. And we seek out friendships, we seek out relationships where we feel comfort and support. We're driven to connect. And here's what I want you to understand. Remember in the definitions, we said that the abuser is the one that orchestrates the trauma bond. The abuser knows somebody's trying to connect with them. Somebody's looking to them for support, for friendship, for help. They see that, they feel it. Now they're not just going to abuse the person, they're going to abuse that connection drive to create a trauma bond. That's sad. what can happen in a child because of this is that they often then begin to associate love with abuse. That if a person loves you, they'll abuse you. And that's normal. they get a distorted view of love.",

But what's going on inside their brain is, but I know if I just keep trying, a jackpot will come. And that intermittent aspect keeps hope alive longer that will get back to the good. Because I've seen it once, I've seen it periodically. I just have to try a little bit longer, my luck's going to change. that intermittent piece is huge. somebody said this, trauma bonding happens, specifically because an abuser provides you with intermittent rewards and punishments. In doing , a psychological conditioning takes place whereby the survivor becomes entangled in the relationship, always hoping to return to when it's good, it's good timeframe. Eventually you will settle for almost any little breadcrumb of the version of who the narcissist was in the beginning. You may even settle for not having to do anything. You may even settle for not having to do anything. You may even settle for not being punished as a reward or for a version of love bombing. that leads to that this is an addiction issue. An addiction develops in the brain. if you think of a person with drug addiction, in the beginning, it was all positive. The drug gave them a high, it took all their problems away, just made life feel wonderful. But then more and more negative happening. And now they're in a state of depression. And they're in a state of depression. Now the drug is destroying them. But what is going on in the brain. If I do it one more time, maybe I'll get the high again. I need to do it one more time. And they keep going back to the drug, even though it is hurting them and destroying them. That's what's happening in trauma bonding. It started great, but now this person is abusing you and you keep going back to them, hopeful in the future. And the drug is destroying them. they're in a state of depression. it's going to be different this time. Dr.",

They don't realize it's paralyzing, that now you're getting benefits out of remaining a victim, feeling sorry for yourself. It feels a little bit good, but it paralyzes you from actually changing. it becomes self-defeating. There's one other piece to this for some people. And that is, when you look at complex trauma families, often you find that everybody in the family is acting a victim. if you look at the diagram, it's called the drama trauma. It's a triangle. you have, let's say, dad, and he's narcissistic. he's angry, he's judgmental. He acts he's in control. He acts he's the boss. But what happens when things don't go his way. He plays the victim. He blames mom, he blames the kids for all of his problems. He doesn't take responsibility to grow up, to change, to improve things. He just blames everybody. Then you look at mom, the enabler. what happens with her. Does she stand up to dad. Does she say, I am not going to continue to live this. I am going to get out of here, protect the kids. No, she blames the kids. She blames her husband. She goes to counseling to try to get the counselor to fix the family, but she's not willing to actually change and stand up for stuff. Who are the true victims. The children. Everybody else is playing the victim. Victim mentality, where the true victims are the children. And when you grow up in a family where you've got your two people, your parents, your caregivers, who are in a victim mentality, that's your normal. That's your template. And it's very easy to slide into it. recovery is about getting out of any victim mentality. It is saying, that child was a victim. That child didn't have tools. That child didn't have support. But I have agency now. I have tools. I have support. I can make a difference in my circumstances today. I can make decisions today that child couldn't make about relationships, about boundaries, about changes. And I'm going to do it. I will not continue to get stuck and feeling in pain.

You parent your biological child differently than you parent yourself. You're loving and nurturing and comforting and understanding to your biological children because what shame-based parenting did to you. But yet, when you parent yourself, you still use shame-based parenting. People don't grow from shame or heal from shame until they parent themselves in a loving, nurturing way. And that starts with that little part of you that you've always been embarrassed by. let me just read this. It came out recently. I found it. It says, Toxic shame has its root in childhood, abandonment, abuse, and trauma. And you're familiar with all that. As such, feeling better will almost always go back to accessing your childhood self, the very part of you that was confronted with the trauma in the first place. Learning how to interact with and care for your younger self is called inner child work. And there are a number of reasons why this practice is powerful. Firstly, inner child work helps you access feelings that you have repressed and disassociated from in an attempt to protect yourself as a child. By re-experiencing these emotions, you'll be able to release them from your body and mind and generate deep healing. you connect emotionally. Secondly, inner child work is tremendously insightful and revealing. Often some of the most important questions you've carried consciously or subconsciously are answered while doing inner child work. And thirdly, inner child work is learning self-compassion in action. When you learn how to re-parent your inner child, you develop a deep, strong connection with yourself which has a ripple effect on the rest of your life. what's inner child work. Re-parenting yourself. Learning to parent yourself with compassion. Learning to stop beating up and rejecting and abandoning yourself. Final point, number 19. Be patient. It takes time. Part, I want to do something a little bit different. what we've been doing with the shame piece is we looked at the people loved and we saw some pretty messed up people that He loved and we looked at a couple of stories. Then we looked at what says about us and we went through all the different verses where describes who we are.",

That's part of the complex trauma disconnection thing. Another type of disconnection is to just focus on your external world, your body, your diet, your healthy eating, your exercise. you're always wrapped up. And you think you're working on yourself, but you're only working on the external parts of yourself. And it's a way of disconnecting from the internal parts of themself. And then in the most extreme cases of trauma, the brain has to go to extreme measures to try and protect somebody who is being traumatized, either brutally sexually abused, and what can happen in that case, is what we call dissociative identity disorder. The person actually dissociates from what is happening in the here and now. And if there's sexual abuse, they can picture themself on the ceiling watching it's happening to somebody else. Or they can go and put themselves on a beach in Florida and just be totally out of touch with what is happening. that used to be called multiple personality disorder. And it's really in the extreme types of danger and trauma, the only way the brain knows how to protect the child is to splinter as a person and develop other personalities to protect that child. And some of it is dissociating from reality. those are all kinds of different ways that the brain tries to disconnect from living. With self that it doesn't and doesn't want to spend time with. Now let's move to today. You could be going in your recovery and you're connected to yourself, you're self-aware, you're doing stuff every day where you're taking an emotional inventory, a spiritual inventory, and checking out your relationships, and you're really conscientiously staying connected. And you're finding a lot of benefits comes from that. Because you're noticing different trends and gaining new insights into yourself. But what you need to be aware of is that something can happen and can trigger your brain to disconnect without you even realizing it. what are the things that would trigger your brain starting to disconnect today.

    "text": "welcome to another Friday night. Tonight I want to talk about an aspect of trauma that you may not have heard before but it's such an important piece to understand. It's called betrayal trauma and why it's such an important piece to understand is because it's part of complex trauma. complex trauma is technically different than betrayal trauma but all complex trauma for children especially contains betrayal trauma and for many of you who've gone through complex trauma as children the trauma is very painful but it's the betrayal of those that are supposed to love you that aren't don't have your back that's even more painful and it's really important to get a com if one is to get a complete picture of their life in this complex trauma to understand this betrayal part this betrayal trauma that's included in it and that's what I want to look at today and for many of you I think as I go through this it's going to actually be kind of painful. It's going to stir up some painful memories of being betrayed by those that were supposed to love you and I hope that it also leads to healing that it helps you better understand some of the of your trauma and what you can do in practical steps to begin to heal that part of the trauma. let's begin with the definition of betrayal trauma. here's kind of a technical one. Betrayal trauma occurs when the people or institutions on which a person depends for survival significantly violate that person's trust or -being. Betrayal trauma is the result of a violation of deep attachment. it takes place within attachment relationships. That is important to understand. there's an attachment relationship and then within that relationship there's abuse. you're in a situation where you're being abused or neglect by the person that you're depending on for your safety and -being. That is betrayal trauma. you need this person, you attach to this person, and they let you down. another thing by Sabrina Romanoff from Yeshiva University. Betrayal trauma describes the emotional impact a person experiences after their trauma. Betrayal trauma is when a person's trust or -being is violated either by people or institutions that are significant in their life. Institutions that they rely on for survival.",

    "text": "those are a whole bunch of examples that just hopefully help you begin to realize that this has probably been a part of your life. That you've experienced betrayal trauma. what I think is important to understand is that betrayal trauma is more than just the traumatic event and the pain of that traumatic event. It's a trauma where the pain goes even deeper. It hurts even more. And the question is why. Why does betrayal trauma hurt more than any other trauma. And I think it's due to that bonding, that attachment piece. somebody has said this, intimate bonding with another person serves an important developmental role. It enhances the child, chances of survival. a baby comes in, they can't be thrown these, they need to attach. They need to attach to somebody if they're going to survive. Somebody who will meet their needs for them. And as a result of that, they form this deep emotional connection. And that's the key piece. And as a result, there are biological substrates that support the formation of psychologically intimate relationships. betrayal adversely affects these substrates. The psychological injury of betrayal is likely to create in a sense, a functional physical injury within the brain that is challenging to recover from, but not impossible. what it's saying is that when you securely attach as a child, it sets off a whole bunch of, of dynamics inside of your brain, inside of your body, your emotions. And when you're betrayed, all of those get damaged. And those are very, very hard to recover from. I asked myself, what does being betrayed feel. And you can make your own list, but let me just get you started on it. Many people who've been betrayed will say I got stabbed in the back. I didn't see it coming from the front. It was sneaky. I got stabbed in the back. Others will say, I got punched in the gut. It just knocked the wind out of me. It's the air was taken out of my sails. I got hit by a truck. My heart got ripped out and stomped on. you're just trying to put into words with metaphors, how painful this is. It just , it just sucks the life out of you. Some people, say it feels I died or it feels somebody else died.",

There's an anticipated visceral feeling or mental excitement and stimulation, if not an elation, a thrill, a rush, and even a sense of euphoria. I've had many people that engage in criminal behavior tell me that when they're getting ready to go and commit a crime, all of a sudden they got to go to the bathroom and void their bowels because they're excited. There's such a visceral excitement and intensity that is happening inside of them. then they commit the crime, and that takes them to the fourth stage, the post-criminal act. They get away with it. There's an exhilaration, typically a flooding of mood, elevating feelings, similar to an adrenaline rush accompanied with thoughts that synthetically increase their sense of -being. In short, the criminal act can help in the process of getting them to the point where they're ready to go. This takes them to the last stage, which is the heat of the crime that's happening within the driver's lanes, and that's the level 5, the level 8 ofność, where more and more criminals feel the brain is shouldn't be up ahead where more and more cannibalism is experiencing multiple disputes. But there is sure to be a way that recommendationumer, -being turns overnight into nothing and nothing. Say till a shooting starts at 30 thermal, my ex, get outta here, we'reада ironically how it begins. followers, social media is available on all of our social media platforms. clubs in North America. But there is still anxiety as to why it takes long. that is post-criminal act confusion. It's almost a roller coaster. They hit this high and now they're going to descend to this low. And the third and fourth stage of exhilaration and adrenaline rush is replaced with new dramatic and unexpected changes in emotional awareness. Here they become confused, depressed, and socially withdrawn as experience withdrawal- reactions. they might start sweating, getting headaches, anxiety, nausea, heart arrhythmia. And on a psychological level, they experience confusion, guilt, afterthoughts, misgivings, anxiety, depression, dramatic mood shifts ranging from feelings of sadness to hopelessness. that's the five stages that take place for most in committing a crime.",

In the beginning, when your partner says that didn't happen, you don't believe them. You go, that's crazy. And you can say something's wrong with them. But you start to believe them. But it starts with disbelief and then that vanishes. if you're seeing things that cause you to go, this is crazy. That did happen. They're saying it didn't, but it did. Take that as a red flag. Second thing is you defend yourself. You fight back. You say that didn't happen. I know what I saw. I know what I'm thinking accurately. And you have a big argument about it. you start with shock and disbelief that they're saying that you are wrong. Then you argue about it. But then you go beyond that. if you don't stop with number one and you go and you keep arguing and keep arguing, but you stay in the relationship and you don't get out even though they never admit they're wrong, then you go to the third stage and that is their goal. And that is the stage that has a lot of depression as part of it. you don't even know who you are. You don't what you're feeling. Who you are almost seems you're an alien creature from who you used to be. And that's really depressing. And now you walk around hating yourself, down on yourself, not liking being in your own skin even more than normal. And then that depression comes further by being cut off from all your supports. the people who would normally encourage you, the people that would normally validate your perception of things and your feelings, aren't around.",

And then you go, you have people express concern about how you're doing, but they treat you got a problem. And that confirms that you do have a problem. anybody that comes up and say, are you. You don't go, oh, thank you for caring. You go, I think you think I'm crazy. And now you go, see, everybody thinks I'm crazy, not just my partner. now you're misinterpreting kindness, concern, because you've come to such a distorted place in your thinking. it doesn't matter what anybody does, you interpret it through a negative lens. that is gaslighting. Now the question I want to end with is, why do you think I'm crazy. Why is it that people from complex trauma are the ones, I would say, almost 100 of the time that fall prey to being gaslit. And it's very important to understand that a person coming out of a healthy home who's got a fairly healthy way of looking at life and dealing with life, if they met a gaslighter and developed a friendship with them, it would be ended. As soon as they saw the warning signs. What causes a person to go and stay in that and let it take its toll. They come from complex trauma. how does complex trauma set a person up to be gaslit by somebody else. Number one, shame. Complex trauma naturally teaches a child the reason I'm abused, neglected, or abandoned is I must not be good enough. And to compensate for that, because they don't feel lovable or valuable, they say I need to become a people pleaser. And that means I just agree with everybody, I go along with everybody, but I need people to me. Narcissists prey on those kind of people. And they begin by giving you positive validation. And you soak it in. And you want it. But then they start withholding validation. And you think, I just need to try harder. And then they start disrespecting you. And then gaslighting you. But you are desperate to get validation, you stay in there and keep trying to improve. Because when they say, if you would only change here and do this, I wouldn't be angry at you. And you believe that. you say, I'll just try to change here.",

What should I change. What should I do that's going to help to meet those needs. Have I been neglecting in my life any of the things that I had built into my life that were important for keeping me in a healthy place, that were meeting all of the needs. what happens to a lot of people is when they're in crisis, they go, I need to start getting up every morning and having time just to do yoga, to meditate, to just be quiet and check in with myself and be mindful. And they set up a routine and it begins to really start to change. And then they're in a state of mind that's , oh, I'm feeling good. I don't need to do that stuff anymore. And pretty soon they're depleted again. And what you need to be able to go do is say, have I been neglecting any of the activities that once were very important in my recovery. Things that were feeding my soul and meeting my needs. And then that mindfulness, where is my stress level at. Where is my anxiety. Where is my anxiety. Where is my stress level at. Where is my anger at. Where is my fatigue at. Where is my anxiety at. Where is my depression at. Why that's important is because for many people with complex trauma, I'm not aware of depression or anxiety or stress until it hits a 10 out of 10. I need to stop and maybe it's only at a four, but whoa, why is it at a four when it's usually at a two. I need to be able to become aware of the more subtle. Emotions when they're not at that intense point. let me end by saying this, this part of self-awareness and doing that self inventory and figuring out what's going on for many people, they need to stop for a half an hour and be really quiet and get centered and grounded. And then they need to be connected and connected to their body and connected to their emotions before they can ask those questions.",

And we have people here from addiction, people here from childhood trauma, people here from just messed up relationships looking for help and for answers. we tend to do little series that focus on themes that follow this way of thinking. We teach that addiction and a lot of the relationship issues aren't the real problems, they're symptoms of deeper problems. we to understand what are the deeper problems that have resulted in me developing ways of coping with those problems that aren't healthy and are messing up my life today. the series that we're on now is called The Real Problems of Addiction. And it's a series that we're on now that we're learning about where we're going to go from here. And then it's the 3rd one that we're going to be talking about now is, this is our 3rd one is shame. Shame is a word that's not understood. But I would say from my experience as a counselor in the field of trauma and addiction, shame is one of the biggest issues that people have to deal with. And if they don't understand it, it can really mess them up, but to understand it is very painful. shame, just to summarize very briefly, is a core belief that a child develops when they're neglected or abused or abandoned or their needs aren't consistently met, where they think the reason those things are happening to me is because I'm not good enough. Something is wrong with me. And that core belief takes hold deep inside of them. And without them realizing it, it begins to shape how they approach relationships. It begins to shape how they think about themselves, how they treat themselves, how they cope in life. And they do things that make them feel better in the moment and let them survive in the moment. But it messes up all the other things long term. And we've been trying to understand what shame is and how it affects us. And I want to develop it a little bit further tonight. What we are.

    "text": "the part I want you to walk away from is this. Shame is I don't respect myself. Now I have to say, do I have value. Yes, I have number one. I have inherent value because I'm a human being. I need to respect myself at a bare minimum for number one. Number two. I don't have to have a lot of respect for myself. I don't have to have a lot of respect for myself. I don't have to have a lot of respect for myself. I don't have to have a lot of respect for myself. Number two and three, the more I have good character and the more I am a giving person and a loving person, I will actually grow in respect for myself. But the first step of healing shame is I respect myself based on number one. I have inherent value. I don't have to do anything. I can be a total jerk, but I still have some value. Let's start there and then we can work on it. I work on two and three as part of our recovery and our respect will grow. , let me just give you one thing more to think about. Take respect. If you were to go to a street level, respect is a huge word. Loyalty is part of that. And what does respect and honor mean on a street level. It is something that you respect me based on fear. You don't. Rat me out. You don't hold me accountable for the bad things I do. You affirm me for the good things and you support me for the bad. You never stand up to me. That's respect. You see how it just took respect and twisted it. what you'll find is shame takes every good quality and it distorts it and it makes it something with the same worth. You can't just say that. It's not a word, but a totally different definition and something unhealthy. And that you can think about. We don't have time to develop. , next thing I want you to think about how does shame affect conflict in a relationship. It does a lot. What happened for you if you grew up in complex trauma is there was conflict, but you notice that when there was conflict, there was a winner and there was a loser.",

Before you'll treat yourself nicely again. Some will go two weeks, some will say, or two days, some will say a week. That's how much I want to be punished. That's how much I got to punish myself before I think justice has been served. shame taps into that justice system. And it says, because I feel I failed, or I feel a failure, I need to punish myself all the time. Because I feel a failure all the time, therefore punishment all the time. And one of the things that many people do is just focus on their negative thoughts. One of the things that many people do is just focus on their negative thoughts. And they don't look at their good qualities, they don't look at accomplishments, they're just always finding fault with themselves. , two more things, very quickly. Shame, I think, is one of the biggest things to affect mental health today. And I think the mental health world is gradually starting to realize it. And what I've done is on the very left is complex trauma, and it's a spectrum from very severe trauma to mild trauma. , next to that are all the mental health issues that come out. the greater the trauma, the greater the shame. if somebody neglected you, your shame might not be as bad as somebody who was abandoned, or who was sexually abused, or severely physically abused. They're going to feel even worse that it's their fault, that they have no value. Next to that, they're going to have more anger issues. Next to that, they're going to have more depression issues. The greater their trauma, the greater their shame. if you have tons of shame, you're going to have tons of depression because you don't your life. It sucks. And then you're going to have greater anxiety issues. What do people think of me. Is anybody going to love me. All of that comes out of tons of shame.

Then there's children who grow up where mom and dad fight, and there's lots of violence, and there's violence within the home that they witness, though they might never get hit, but they experience that. Then there's children who go through medical trauma, diagnosed with cancer or severe diseases, afraid that they might die, and living in hospitals and all of those kind of conditions for them. And then there's traumatic grief, when somebody dies who's very close to you, and the trauma that creates. And then there's abuse, and there's abuse that is sexual, physical, verbal, emotional. We talk about parents who have a mental health disorder, that they're not able to parent you in the way that you need. What I found interesting in going back through some of the latest research, is that they're now saying that the biggest cause of complex trauma in the Western world is neglect. parents meet your physical, mental needs, but they're not there for you emotionally. And you feel that they're in the same room, but they're not really present. And that kind of neglect makes a child feel all alone. They feel abandoned. And those are some of the different types of trauma that a child can experience. Now I want to talk about just some perspectives, that I've been thinking about, that might help you in your processing of understanding complex trauma in your own life. the first thing I want you to understand is this. Complex trauma means that a child had to move from being healthy in the way they lived, and had to adapt to a different type of behavior in order to survive. That is a key piece to understand. let me, let me present it this way. I don't know if you've thought about it, but children for the most part, when they come into the world, they have good instincts built into them. A child, they want to connect with their caregivers, with their siblings. They want to be authentic and express their personality openly. They want to open up and tell you what's happening inside of them. They want to cry, and express the emotions that they're feeling.",

    "text": "That the children born of unwanted pregnancies are at risk of behavioral and psychological issues. In other words, somehow they get complex trauma that results then in maladaptations, behaviors in adolescents that begin to cause a lot of damage. this whole unwanted pregnancy thing, the unwanted baby, has really led to a discussion. Can a baby in the womb, in utero, sense whether or not they're wanted. And there's a whole bunch of research that's now coming out about this that I find just fascinating. But just let me give you what has been written by several German researchers. And they said this, the fetal autonomic nervous system is negatively affected by maternal adverse emotional states. there's now evidence that if the mom is not in a good emotional state, if she's going through a lot of negative emotions, she's going to have a lot of negative emotions. And she's going to have a lot of negative emotions. It does affect the fetus. There is currently growing evidence to suggest that increased maternal stress during pregnancy can lead to adverse effects on the physiological, metabolic, and neuronal development of the fetus during gestation with possible long-lasting effects. Generally speaking, adverse maternal emotional states such as depression, anxiety, social stress, discrimination, and general prenatal distress can lead to a lot of negative effects. Similarly, a lot of ethos and negative emotions can be associated with infertility. Maturity and mental distress can influence fetal and neonatal motor, cognitive, and social development. And I've just seen repeated research coming out that says that the fetus can be affected by the mother's emotional state. It senses it and it can activate the child's stress system, even within the womb. Emily Guarnada has said this, Babies are affected by their parents' emotional state while in the womb. but the full extent is still unknown. we're still researching this but we're starting to see patterns and that can be both positive and negative. on the positive for example when mothers feel joy their bodies release oxytocin also known as the bonding hormone and research from 2007 suggests that the more oxytocin that is released during the first trimester the more bonding there will be between the mother and the child after birth. it's going to have very positive effects on the ability of the mother to bond with the child.",

And what happens to a lot of people that come out of complex trauma with a distorted mirror that says I'm not lovable, I'm not valuable, that's why I'm being abused, that's why I'm being neglected. It's my fault. They come into recovery and they come and they meet somebody you and you say to them, I'm getting to know you, you're a wonderful person. You just contradicted the mirror. what's going on in their head. , they're just saying that to be nice. They don't really mean it.

I was incapable of having healthy relationships. And the pseudo sexual intimacy continuously fed the core shame beliefs that I had no value and was unlovable. The only option left was to get help. I had tried every avenue available to me and nothing was working. I had been in therapy for thirty years. In and out of addiction treatment centers, psychiatric units. And was medicated to the eyeballs with several different diagnoses. And here's where Tim Fletcher and his teachings come into the picture.

The first message was before we can move forward. We must go forward. We must go back to our childhood trauma. We need to understand how our sexual identity was formed. And how the trauma responses are still showing up in our adult lives. Then and only then do we have the power to change them. what happened. What caused me to flip the switch and behave that way and what can I do to change it. back to my beginning. Here is a brief history to help you see a clear picture of my childhood. But I don't want to dwell too long here because it's not where the magic happens. That comes later. My father was an alcoholic and was sexually abused by his father. My mother was a narcissist who hated me, beat me and told me I was a nobody. And my grandfather was a pedophile. Sexual abuse in my family history can be dated back many generations. Which was an important piece I needed to know. Before starting my healing journey. My sexual identity began forming at the age of five. Which for me means it was prematurely woken up. I am the second youngest of five. And my mother was tired and broken down by the time I came into the picture. The only time she paid any attention to me was when she was hitting or yelling at me.",

    "text": ", welcome to another Friday night. We're winding down our series on the prisons that come out of complex trauma, the things that were necessary survival coping patterns in childhood in order to survive the abuse or neglect, but what have become now in adult life big problems, causing issues in relationships, jobs, hurting others, hurting ourselves. And what happens for many people is they go to try to stop doing it, but something keeps drawing them back into repeating it. It becomes a prison. And today I want to talk about the potential that happens for many with complex trauma is to begin to confuse sexuality as being love. And this is to me a talk that I've touched on four or five different times because sexuality is such a big component for me. Many people in recovery that they need to think through, that they realize is unhealthy in their life. And I want to come at it from a little different perspective today that I hope is really helpful. I want you to know up front a couple of things. Number one, I want you to know that I'm not going to approach this in moralistic terms. What I've seen over the years is that for most people coming out of complex trauma, it affects their sexuality in. In negative ways. And for many people coming out of complex trauma, they're not even aware of that. But when they get to adult life, they begin to realize that they have some sexual behaviors that they realize are unhealthy, that are hurting themselves, that are hurting others. And they go to want to stop it, but something keeps every time they're triggered in certain ways, they just go back to those unhealthy sexual behaviors. it's realizing the unhealthy sexuality, sexual behaviors that come out of complex trauma, that is our focus today. Now, what you begin to realize when you work in this field is that sexuality is a massive subject. And what they're realizing from research is sexuality affects almost every part of our life. one of the things we see with complex trauma is it affects our brain, our immune system, our nervous system, our physical health. It just touches everything. It just touches everything. Every part of what makes us human. What we're seeing with sexuality, it's almost just as powerful.",

It could be a total internal fantasy world sex, but it's still a sex life. we must take this as a given that everybody has a sex life.

But let's go to a child from complex trauma. , all three of those conditions are not, they're not capable of. They don't feel safe. They aren't able to securely attach. And they're in their sympathetic nervous system. what is happening to them. They're not able to secure emotional attachment. and complex trauma is the very three things necessary to learn the most satisfying form of sex. They're not in an environment where any of those three things are going to happen. what then happens to that child. They get into their puberty years, they experience sex, but it's purely physical. They're in their sympathetic nervous system. They don't feel safe. They're not connecting. They're not transitioning, but they get their puberty years. the physical sensation. And to their brain, that's all they've known. That's all they've experienced. they think, this is sex. what do they focus on. I will become a professional in learning how to have the greatest physical genital sex in the world. I will learn every technique. I will study the physical organ and the physical act that I get the greatest sex in the world. That's where their thinking goes. They do not, they have not been exposed to attachment-based sex, to understanding the psychological, emotional components of truly satisfying, meaningful sex. And they sadly, and this at times just breaks my heart, but they do not, they do not, they do not, they do not, they do not, they do not, they are pursuing enhancing the physical aspects of sex, but are totally missing out on understanding the emotional attachment basis of sex. And they will not experience truly, truly satisfying sex. And that happens for many. Now, let me just very quickly cover, to summarize, what are some of the areas then that are affected by a child's sexuality. And we started with this, and I just want to highlight a couple things. number one, a child's sexuality has a profound effect on the shaping of a child's identity. nothing intensifies the feelings of vulnerability in a child sexual stuff. how a person responds to a child in those key developmental stages, has a profound effect on their identity.",

It then produces tons of anxiety, tons of fear, a profound impact on identity. But then, sex touches many of our needs. When you look at our acceptance need, it's our whole personality, but it also includes our sexuality. And how somebody responds to me sexually, that affects whether I feel accepted. It touches our abandonment issues. It touches our validation issues. It touches our guilt or false guilt issues. It's very much part of, the process of trying to find a relationship with someone. And I think that's a very important part of the process of trying to find a relationship with someone. learning boundaries. I can say no. It's about learning autonomy, where I end, where you begin, what I can say no to, what I can allow for myself. It's very much connected to our trust issues. It's very much connected to our attachment connection issues. sex is connected to basically every need. But when a child thinks that becomes a solution totally to meeting that need, that's where it goes wrong. Hopefully you're listening to this and going, I see how my complex trauma has distorted some of my sexuality and resulted in some unhealthy approaches to sexuality. How do I heal. begin by understanding the things from your childhood that distorted your sexual development. Be very clear about that. And then begin to differentiate between the things that distorted your sexual development and the things that distorted your sexual development. And then begin to differentiate between the things that how those things did distort your sexuality. look for patterns of behavior that developed, emotional patterns that developed, beliefs that developed about yourself, about sex, the needs that you tried to meet with sex, the issues that you tried to solve with sex. Just kind of map out how your sexuality developed and how it all interfaces, with everything else. Then find somebody safe that you can begin to talk honestly about these issues without fear of being judged, without fear of them thinking you're a pervert or a sick person. Somebody that you can really begin to process this stuff.",

    "text": "The thing to really watch out for is you do not want a relationship where the sexual relationship is not a sexual relationship, but it is basically determined by what one partner wants. you get somebody with a hypersexual drive that just wants it all the time and is mad if the partner doesn't constantly give it to them and doesn't constantly sacrifice for them, or you get somebody from severe sexual abuse that just never wants it and expects the other partner to go without sex. you want to find a balance, a way to meet both partners' sexual needs in a healthy way, and that is tricky and important to learn how to navigate. Next thing I want you to be aware of is there are going to be times when sexual activity will trigger underlying issues. it will trigger shame, it will trigger false guilt, it will make you feel very vulnerable, it will make you fear being rejected. it's going to trigger a whole bunch of complex trauma issues. When that happens, don't get down on yourself, but be curious. Explore what's going on here, where's that coming from, what happened in my childhood to cause me to have this trigger. Are there any lies that come out of this that I need to be aware of. That becomes the process of continued growth in this area, is every time you're triggered, you begin to explore, learn new things, and then you grow a little bit more. let me end by what for me is a very challenging scenario. And that is when you end up in a relationship with somebody who comes out of severe sexual abuse. I have worked with many couples, and what typically happens is the person is severely sexually abused, they just, sex triggers them too much, they don't want sex, the other partner ends up with this powerful sex drive, but they just, every time they want to have sex, their partner gets mad, there's a big conflict, and they have to do without sex. Ruth Cohn talks about her early days as a sex therapist, and back in the early 90s, there was basically one book out on this topic, and it was by Wendy Maltz called The Sexual Healing Journey.",

    "text": "And here's what Ruth Cohn says, that one lonely volume was practical and hands-on about things couples might try and do, however, the heart of its message was that the partner of the designated traumatized, in this case the sexually violated client, the one who had been sexually abused, that the partner needed to be patient and supportive, beyond saintly, a little therapist-, in effect they were to disappear or disavow their own pain and discomfort. In other words, they were to be patient with their partner, but basically stop having any sexual needs, any sexual desires. they were to continue to endure, wait, figure out how to manage their own physical and emotional desire and frustration about the lack of sex. This approach was understandably wearing thin for these men and for many that wildly understates it. It was torture, it was cruel. Meanwhile, the person who had been sexually abused, they felt guilty for saying no all the time. They felt pressured into giving in and having sex, which then re-traumatized them, and that sure didn't make them feel more desirous by them saying no, by them having many issues. it just starts creating even greater baggage between the couple. while the partner somehow tolerates, sexless, often completely touchless, monogamy, and often for years, they both felt terribly stymied and often desperate. And it certainly did not help that no one seemed to be talking with them about the problem, about sex. Rather, the whole subject was sorely neglected. The survival of sexual trauma was designated as the problem child, while the partner was essentially sidelined, overlooked, taken for granted, and in effect neglected. This is, to me, such a huge issue for many people coming out of complex trauma that they end up with somebody with sexual abuse. They get into a relationship, they love each other, but the sexual relationship just causes much problems. The other person just can't do it, and then that means this person has to give up their needs, and it causes much pain and frustration and conflict and anger and resentment. Get help. Begin to work through that you can both figure out how to help each other sexually, to meet your sexual needs, to heal and grow. I said, this is a massive topic.",

    "text": ", welcome to another Friday night. We've been looking a bit deeper at the 60 characteristics of complex trauma, and today we come to what is probably one of the most commonly known characteristics, emotional dysregulation. And I've talked about it a lot, but today I want to dig into it in a bit more detail with some new research that I find quite fascinating. let me begin by just giving you kind of a definition of emotional dysregulation. It's a term used to describe an emotional response that is poorly regulated and does not fall within the traditionally accepted range of emotional reaction. It may also be referred to as mood swings. When someone is experiencing emotional dysregulation, they may have angry outbursts, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, self-hatred, and even depression. And when someone is experiencing emotional dysregulation, they may have angry outbursts, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, self-hatred, and even depression. And when someone is experiencing emotional dysregulation, they may have angry outbursts, anxiety, depression, self-hatred, and even depression. And when someone is experiencing emotional dysregulation, they may have self-hatred, and even depression. And when someone is experiencing emotional dysregulation, they may have self-harm and other self-damaging behaviors. Over time, the condition may interfere with your quality of life, your social interactions, and relationships at home and work. In other words, it's something that has consequences that begin to cause very important parts of your life to break down and fall apart. when we look at emotional dysregulation from the perspective of complex trauma, what we're talking about is a stress system, which we all have a stress system that is overactive. It's working too much, and it's overreactive. that results in hypervigilance. You're always looking for danger. You're always on guard or hyperarousal. Zero to a hundred in a nanosecond, or an overactive startle response, when you scare a cat and it jumps. Often, emotional dysregulation in people gets diagnosed in children as ADHD. In adults, often they would get a borderline personality diagnosis. I want to kind of talk today about the effects of emotional dysregulation on people. And I want to talk about the effects of emotional dysregulation on people. the information that has come out in a book that Dr.",

You guys have done great in that and we are appreciative. But we think you are missing the key foundational ingredient for healing. It's not correct diagnosis and medication, though those are important. The foundational thing that is necessary for healing is connection. And you in the West are a nation that is not connected. Connection is not connected very. Connection is not your strong point. even though you have all these other things but don't have connection, you're missing the key ingredient. And I thought, wow, that is beautiful. true. We have to start with connection to safe, healthy people. And we talk about that all the time. , that's the end of part one.

A role that was absolutely essential if he was going to be an effective leader. And that was he had to become an encourager to others. He had to mentor others in a very encouraging, supportive way. And I want to look at Peter's relationship to a guy we know as Mark or John Mark. He wrote the second in the New Testament part of the. And in 1 Peter, Peter is writing a letter. And he says, your sister here in Babylon, and probably referring to Rome, it was a coded way of saying that, sends you greetings. And does my son. Mark. Now it's not his literal son. But Peter is saying he's become a son. let me tell you a little bit about this John Mark. Because I think it's just fascinating to me. if we go to Acts 12, we're going back to the beginning of the.",

    "text": ", we're almost done this series on shame. And I said in the previous talks, when I teach shame at React, we do a whole week on it. It is one of the heaviest weeks for clients as they begin to realize how much shame they have. Because for them, it's something that's always operated at a subconscious level. And it's impacted them. They just haven't been aware of it. And as they become aware of it, it just really gets heavy for them. And what I hear starting on Tuesday is, when are you going to tell us how to heal from shame. When are you going to tell us how to heal from shame. And I said, not until you sit in it for a while and let me diagnose it and really convince you as to how screwed up you are. And that you understand just how big this issue is. tonight I want to come to the healing from shame. And we're only going to do one part tonight. And then next Friday we're going to do the rest of the healing from shame. And I hope it is a very helpful thing for you. And what, again, we've said in all of the talks, in my mind it is the greatest negative consequence of complex trauma. And it has the greatest. greatest negative impact on a person's life. Because what shame is, is a core belief about yourself. And it's a core belief that is negative. It is a core belief that says, I don't think I'm good enough. I think the reason I was rejected, abandoned, abused, neglected, is because I must have something wrong with me that makes me unlovable and I don't have any value. And that core belief begins to morph in all kinds of different. directions and affects all your adult relationships, your coping, the messages that go on in your head. And it's all negative. And what do we do to begin to heal. what I want to do is, what I do with the clients, is the first step of healing is to begin to understand what happens or has been happening at a subconscious level in your. life. what I do is I put a diagram on the board and I say, your shame can be triggered in hundreds of different ways.",

Because if I can spot negative, I can stop it from hurting me. And you become focused on negative. And you become focused on negative. Guess what that does in your coping life. You find everything that's wrong and then you say, life sucks, why bother. And away you go. Now let me just stop again and say, do you see how these things can be relapse things.

Because they're in that negative thing. And they could have 99 of the things in their life could be very positive, but they notice the one negative thing. And they obsess on it and it colors their whole perspective on life. Number 14. Develop an instant gratification focus. think of it this way. If you grew up with an element of pain and with an element of abuse where you never had a whole lot of good things happen to you and you're living in that environment, and all of a sudden you get an opportunity for something pleasurable and fun, you go grab it. Or to put it this way, if you grew up, let's say, with your dad as an alcoholic, and dad says, I want to take you guys out for ice cream today. Would you to go out now for ice cream or would you to wait till after supper tonight. Where do you go. We're taking it now, buddy, because you could be drunk tonight. And the whole focus when you're in trauma is if there's immediate gratification, immediate pleasure available, take it, because you may not get another opportunity for a while. And that's, that's what we call the emotional recovery. And that sets people up to become very impulsive. You think, you act before you think.",

And you start to feel, you feel losses, you feel guilt, you feel pain. And your brain is saying, I don't this. And guess what you do. I'm going to go to a counselor who will fix it now. , don't bother coming to me because I will probably say, we're going to sit in this for a little while. And you're going to go, why. I want out of it. And I go, I want to deal with it in healthy ways. But that is not stuff. you could get very irritated and angry if you're made to wait for a little while.

And it's as long as life stays in that exciting, emotional, honeymoon type of stage, I'm good for the, the first week that it lasts. And that happens in relationships. That happens for many in recovery. The first part of recovery is all honeymoon, pink cloud. Wow, this is great. Then they begin to come off of that pink cloud and they go, this is work.

To learn to express that in healthy ways. To learn to manage that. To give up all of the unhealthy ways of anger. There are a lot of tools there. That's a big challenge, but it is an important part of growth and recovery. Because this anger thing, usually we end up damaging those we love the most. And I hope that you're going to realize that. And I hope that you're going to learn to stop doing that. And I hope that you're going to learn to be a heartbreaker. And you're going to learn that you're going to be a heartbreaker. You're going to learn to be a heartbreaker. And that's why we want to grow in this area, is to stop doing damage in intimate relationships. The next characteristic of complex trauma in relationship to emotions is false guilt. true guilt is when I do something that violates love. I should feel guilty because that motivates me to stop lying, to stop stealing, to stop cheating, to stop being disrespectful, to others. true guilt is a powerful, good, negative emotion that's designed anger to push me back to living within the boundaries of love. False guilt comes out of complex trauma. It's when a child is made to feel guilty even though they didn't do anything wrong. It's when they're made to feel responsible for something that wasn't their responsibility at all. This is common in complex trauma, but most people don't even see it. They think their false guilt is actually true guilt. And distinguishing between true guilt and false guilt is a key element in recovery. let me give you some of the ways parents create false guilt. number one, they blame you for stuff as if it was your fault. dad is angry. Somehow dad makes it your fault. Mom is unhappy. Somehow mom makes it your fault. No, it's their choice to be angry, to be unhappy. It's not your fault. That's on them. But to a child, it's your fault that I'm angry. And you believe it. And now you feel guilty when you haven't done anything wrong. Or dad and mom are getting a divorce.",

You become addicted to chaos. That creates stress. be aware of the internal maladaptive behaviors that actually add to your stress life. The next one that is important to understand, I think you've seen it, is what happens with complex trauma is the child becomes stunted in their emotional growth. instead of gaining more and more tools to handle painful emotions, you become addicted to chaos. That creates stress. To handle emotions, to handle problems, to handle stressful situations, you just go to fight or flight. you have a low emotional intelligence. You become stunted in your emotional growth. That's why for many people coming out of complex trauma, they might be 50 years old physically, but they feel eight years old emotionally because that's the tools they have in their emotional world is that of an eight-year-old. a big part of that is that they have a lot of tools. a big part of recovery is emotional growth. It is getting back to that stunted emotional state and learning tools to handle life, to handle stress, to handle situation that you're growing emotionally. Now that takes a lot of work, but it is vital because if you remain stunted emotionally, you will basically, be incapable of healthy adult relationships and you will do a lot of damage to your partner and to your children. The final emotional issue I want to talk about today that comes out of complex trauma is fear of abandonment. And next time I'm going to look at all of the other fears that come out of complex trauma. And the key thing to understand is that complex trauma creates fear as the main emotion, as the default emotion. And it shows up in hundreds of different ways. But fear of abandonment is one of the most powerful fears. It is intense. But for most people, they're not even aware it's there. It is subconscious. It is below the surface. It only shows up when they're in an intimate relationship. let me go back. Complex trauma basically is a child feeling abandoned. they're neglected. They're abused. They feel all alone in the world. They feel abandonment.",

And because of that, they saw it from the small child's eyes. Now, when we take them back, we want them to realize they're not that small child anymore. They now have tools. They now have support. And they're able to see it from a different perspective. They're able to, they're able to, to now process it, to resolve it. And that's where the healing happens. And what you can see though, is when you take a person back and they start to reprocess that memory, all of a sudden, they don't feel safe again. It's bringing back all the old emotions. And they go back, you got to reestablish safety. you go back to phase one until they feel safe again. And then they reprocess and heal and they move on. But then the next one memory they have, they start reprocessing that, they don't feel safe. you got to go back to phase one and get them to feel safe again. And that part begins to happen. And how long does it take to reprocess the traumatic memories. For some people, that kind of take months, even years to do all of that. But then you get to a point where they've grown and healed enough.",

But what happens as they go now into adding responsibilities to life, as to expanding their life, they get triggered. They added more stresses and more stress begins to, cause their brain to think, Oh, this is getting unsafe. And they go back to trauma responses. moving on with life takes them to a new phase, which is wonderful, but it results in new triggers. It results in new stresses. And what does that do. It takes them back to not feeling safe. It takes their brain back to go, Oh, I got to go back to old tools to survival mode. And all of a sudden you're back to phase one again. And you're going, let's get safe. , let's process. Let's process what's going on here. Phase two. And then they do deeper healing. And then they can move on again. that moving on phase keeps taking them back to phase one and phase two. And they heal, move on some more, takes them back to phase one, phase two. what does this journey then look. It's not a straight line that's constantly moving upward. It's a line that's going up and down, back, forth, up, down, back, forth. It's slow. It's messy. It is not the medical model. And that is important to understand. The journey of healing from trauma is not a simple, clean and tidy journey. It is a messy, slow, often frustrating process where you feel you're regressing at times. But you keep going at it. And over time you begin to realize, wow, I have grown. I'm not where I was before. let me take that to the next aspect that needs to be considered when we look at healing. I say, tell people there's five components to the recovery journey. the first is education. And this is a huge part of it. Over 90 of people, over 90 of what a person coming out of complex trauma does in their life and their daily life is based on their subconscious program.",

And a huge part of the healing journey is growing in self-awareness, becoming aware of these subconscious programs, bringing them to the conscious level. And that means becoming aware of wounds, becoming aware of their main issues, becoming aware of their triggers, becoming aware of the patterns that take place once they are triggered. And that's a huge amount of this learning journey, education journey. And we do a ton of that in GLIP. But then the question becomes, I know what unhealthy looks. I've been using an unhealthy toolbox for years. What does healthy look. And what do healthy tools look. And that's an education part of the journey. Because if I'm going to change and cope and be healthy, I got to learn all of that stuff. And then how do I parent myself. I didn't get healthy parenting. my role models for parenting growing up are lacking. I have to parent myself now, but I don't know what healthy parenting looks. I need to learn how, what healthy parenting looks. there's just education. Education is such an important part of this journey. But then there's that reprocessing that we talked about therapy. You need a safe therapist who can help you go to those wounds, reprocess them, heal them, help you learn to parent yourself, your inner child, that wounded child within you. That's an important part of the healing journey. Thirdly, you need a healthy support. And that really has two things. You can't do this alone. You need supports. But for many people, their biological family is not the healthiest, safest support network. Often it's toxic. And you have to create a surrogate family, a safe community, other people on the journey who understand this and spend time with them that you are growing in a community and supporting that family. And supporting each other and helping each other. important. And then part of that network is having regular activities where you can come together with other people on the journey and be reminded of important truths, support each other, accept and love each other. All of that becomes important.",

And then you have to be responsible for what they're doing. that they don't keep dragging you down and pulling you back to old behaviors. that healthy support network is such an important part of this journey. let me just add a piece based on that. What I want you to see there is there's two types of kind of relationship things happening. There's a therapist, and there's a support, and there's a trauma. A lot of people in the past, using the medical model, have just thought the way to heal trauma is send them to a counselor once a week for an hour. And that should heal their trauma. I hope you realize that's probably not going to be enough. That's going to. Give them some academic information and tools, but they need to be able to apply those tools in a safe place with safe people that they begin to have that family connection. community where they can learn to live and use the tools. this is such an important thing. You've got to blend both the community, but then you need the therapist that helps you dig into your issues, your unique challenges, and heal and learn tools for that. The fourth component of recovery is healthy relationships. you have this community, this support network, and those are going to be important relationships, but you need to develop some closer connection with one or two or three or four people. The tragedy of complex trauma is that a child can form secure attachment. what is important to understand in recovery is you can't heal it with a trauma. You can't heal it with a trauma. You can't heal it with a trauma. You can't heal it with information alone. You also need to create secure attachment. You need to have true healthy connection with some people. That's where the deepest wounds get healed. I'm not talking about romantic connection. I'm talking about healthy, secure attachment. That becomes such an important part of recovery. And then the fifth area is learning to manage triggers. for most people, they get all this information. They may start making changes in their life.",

Now 20, 30 years later, that prevents a healthy relationship. That hurts the people you love. recovery is bringing all of these subconscious programs to the conscious level.

In cases of severe trauma, you end up with a pure narcissist where it's all about the narcissistic tendencies. I have to put myself ahead of others in order to survive.

    "text": "The other family members, the enabler, the golden child, the lost child, they all have their roles, their orbits determined by their utility to the narcissist. But the entire damn structure, the thing that gives it its stability, rests on a single, foundational cornerstone, the scapegoat. The scapegoat's function is not merely to be the problem child. That's a shallow, pathetic explanation, for a dynamic that is profoundly more sinister. The scapegoat is the family's emotional garbage disposal. They are the living, breathing container for every ounce of shame, inadequacy, and self-loathing that the narcissistic parent cannot bear to face in themselves. They project their darkness onto this child, and in doing , they cleans themselves. The narcissist gets to remain perfect, blameless, a martyr. The family gets to maintain the illusion of hell, because they have a designated patient, a focal point for all their pathology. There's a brutal evolutionary logic to this, twisted as it is. For millennia, human groups have identified scapegoats. It's an ancient survival mechanism. When things go wrong, the hunt fails, the crops wither, you find someone to blame, you cast them out, and you restore order to the tribe. It's a way of simplifying a terrifyingly complex world. But what we're seeing in the narcissistic family is that ancient, primitive mechanism gone hideously pathological. It's a system that has turned inward and begun to devour its own. And here's the terrible irony in all of this, the part that is truly heartbreaking. The scapegoat is almost always the psychologically healthiest member of the family. Think about that for a moment. The person labeled weak, problematic, mentally unstable is in fact the strongest. And why. Because they are the only one who has been forced to confront a reality that isn't a complete fabrication. While the others live in the narcissist's distorted funhouse of mirrors, the scapegoat is the one getting punched in the face by reality. They are the only ones who have had to develop actual, real-world coping mechanisms. They are forced to build resilience, to question, to seek external validation, to develop a self outside the toxic confines of the family unit. They have to become strong because they have no other choice. They are, in a very real sense, the family's unwitting hero forged in the very fires meant to consume them.",

    "text": "The bottle became his new scapegoat. The enabler's awakening is a particularly grim spectacle. For years, they have been the co-signer of the narcissist's lies, the silent partner in the scapegoat's abuse. They were able to maintain a semblance of peace, a fragile personal equilibrium, by never challenging the dominant narrative. The scapegoat's problems were a convenient smoke screen that allowed the enabler to avoid confronting the narcissist and, more importantly, to avoid confronting their own complicity and powerlessness. With the scapegoat gone, the smoke screen lifts. The enabler is now in the room, alone with the tyrant. There is no one else to blame, no one to triangulate, no one to absorb the narcissist's unpredictable rage. They are forced to face the truth of their situation. They are not a partner in a marriage, but a hostage in a two-person cult. Then there are the other siblings, the ones who may have been lost children or active participants in the abuse. For them, the scapegoat's absence triggers a terrifying moral and psychological reckoning. The brothers and sisters who once found common ground in mocking or ostracizing the scapegoat suddenly find that their primary social bond has dissolved. Worse, they are haunted by guilt. They are forced to confront the fact that they stood by, or even joined in, while their sibling was being psychologically brutalized. This guilt can curdle into resentment, either towards the departed scapegoat for abandoning them to this chaos, or towards the narcissistic parent whose true nature is now impossible to deny. The old alliances shatter, and new, vicious conflicts erupt as they scramble for position in the destabilized system. This is precisely what the pioneers of family systems theory, Salvador Mnuchin, described in their work on structural family therapy. Mnuchin saw the family not as a collection of individuals, but as a system with a defined structure, complete with subsystems, boundaries, and alliances. In a dysfunctional family, this structure is rigid and pathological, organized around maintaining a dysfunctional status quo. The scapegoat is a key structural element. They are the lynchpin. When you remove them, you don't just create a hole, you destabilize the entire architecture. The system is thrown into a state of crisis, and it must either collapse or undergo a radical, and excruciatingly painful, reorganization. You could say that these family members have been living in a house of mirrors.",

In those mirrors, the narcissist looked a saint, the golden child looked a hero, the enabler looked a hero, the patient spouse looked a hero, and the scapegoat looked a monster. It was an illusion, but it was a comfortable one. The scapegoat's departure is the equivalent of someone walking into that funhouse and turning on all the overhead fluorescent lights. Suddenly, the mirrors are just glass. The family members see themselves and each other without the flattering distortion. They see the truth, and the truth that emerges is often hideous. Without the scapegoat to blame for the constant tension, the real problems become glaringly visible. The narcissist's bottomless need and rage, the enabler's spinelessness, the profound emotional emptiness at the core of the family. This is often when generational trauma becomes visible to the next generation. Grandchildren who once had a decent relationship with their narcissistic grandparent suddenly see a flash of that coldness, and manipulation directed at them or their parents, and they finally understand the stories the escaped scapegoat had been telling all along. Now, you might think that this brutal confrontation with the truth would be a catalyst for healing and change. You might hope that seeing the dysfunction clearly would force the family to seek help and begin the hard work of repair. But that would be to underestimate the insidious, self-preserving power of the narcissist. The truth is a narcissistic system. A system built on lies does not easily surrender to the truth. When the truth becomes undeniable, the system doesn't turn inward to heal, it turns outward to attack. I had a client whose mother sent a 47-page, single-spaced letter to every single member of their extended family, aunts, uncles, cousins she hadn't seen in 20 years, detailing with the precision of a prosecutor every perceived sin her daughter had ever committed. It was a magnum opus of character assassination, a meticulously crafted document designed to prove, beyond any doubt, that her child was evil, ungrateful, and mentally disturbed. Now listen, and listen carefully, that's not grief. That's not the heartbroken cry of a loving parent. That's warfare. That is the scorched earth strategy of a death-thrown tyrant trying to salt the earth that nothing can ever grow in their former territory again.",

The internet becomes their global weapon. They will be the first platform to broadcast their victimhood to an audience of strangers who will offer them sympathy and validate their twisted version of events. And at the heart of all this is the narcissist's masterpiece, the victim narrative. In this story, they are the selfless, loving parent who has been cruelly abandoned by a cold, ungrateful, and mentally unstable child. They will weep. They will lament. They will perform their grief and their affection. This performance is not only for others, it is for themselves. It is a vital psychological defense. By casting themselves as the ultimate victim, they can completely absolve themselves of any responsibility for the estrangement. It allows them to deny the decades of their own abuse and to project the role of the abuser onto the one person who finally had the courage to escape it. When the narrative isn't enough, the campaign often escalates to legal harassment. This can include filing false police reports for wellness checks designed to intimidate and embarrass. It can involve frivolous lawsuits or, most heinously, the weaponization of grandchildren in bitter custody battles. They will use the institutions of society the police, the courts, the social services as instruments of their personal vendetta all under the guise of concern. They will manipulate churches, schools, and community groups, leveraging their social standing to isolate the scapegoat and paint them as a pariah. Let's be clear about what this is. This is psychological warfare and the tactics are drawn from the same playbook used by cult leaders and totalitarian regimes. The goal is to isolate the dissident, control the flow of information, and destroy their credibility that no one will listen to them. It is an attempt at psychological endowment. It is an attempt at self-denial. And why. What drives this level of venomous desperation. Because the scapegoat's independent, healthy life is the single greatest threat to the narcissist's existence. Your happiness is proof that their narrative was a lie. Your success is a judgment on their failure as a parent. Your peace is a mirror that reflects their own internal chaos. They are not just angry. They are existentially threatened.",

    "text": "They must destroy your new reality because it invalidates their own. There's an evolutionary angle here. Two, humans are profoundly social creatures and we are hardwired to be exquisitely sensitive to gossip and social reputation. Negative information about others is sticky. It captures our attention. A master manipulator, the narcissist, knows this intuitively. They know how to craft a story that plays on our deepest fears of social deviance and betrayal. They hijack our innate social policing mechanisms for their own pathological ends. And here we arrive at the final tragic irony of the smear campaign. Its intensity is directly proportional to how much the narcissistic parent actually needs that child. The more vicious the attacks, the more desperate the lies, the more relentless the harassment, the more it reveals the gaping, bottomless void in the narcissist's own soul. The ferocity of their war against the narcissist's own soul is a perfect measure of the importance of the role you were forced to play in their life. It is the most twisted, backhanded compliment imaginable. But here's what's truly remarkable. While all this chaos is happening, while this toxic war is being waged, in the crumbling family system, something extraordinary is occurring in the life of the escaped scapegoat. Something they never would have thought possible. Here's something that will shock you, and I mean really shock you to the core of your being the child who was labeled as the problem. For decades, the one designated as the source of all chaos and dysfunction often becomes the most psychologically healthy, integrated, and formidable member of the entire family within just a few years of escape. And that isn't just an ironic twist of fate. It is the logical, necessary, and triumphant reassertion of reality over and over again. Over a pathological fiction. It is the phoenix rising, not from methodological flames, but from the very real ashes of psychological warfare. While the narcissistic family system is cannibalizing itself in a frenzy of collapsing narratives and misdirected rage, the escaped scapegoat is undergoing a profound transformation. The first step is simply the quiet, steady process of healing that begins when a chronic poison is removed from a living system. For years, the scapegoat has been the only one living in a state of constant, low-grade, and sometimes high-grade warfare.",

    "text": "Their nervous system has been marinated in cortisol and adrenaline, locked in a perpetual state of fight, flight, or freeze. The simple absence of that daily onslaught of toxicity allows their natural resilience, the biological imperative, towards health that exists in every organism, to finally emerge. The chronic tension begins to bleed out of their shoulders. The hypervigilance begins to soften. They start to sleep through the night, perhaps for the first time in their adult lives. This isn't some new-age fantasy. This is neuroplasticity in action. The brain, that unbelievably adaptable organ, literally begins to rewire itself. The neural pathways that were thickened and overused, the pathways of threat detection, of anxiety, of rumination, start to prune themselves back. New pathways begin to emerge. New pathways begin to form in the prefrontal cortex, the seat of rational thought and emotional regulation. The hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for memory and learning that is often damaged by chronic stress, can begin to heal. The brain, freed from the pathological environment that deformed it, starts to physically reshape itself into an organ of peace and potential, rather than an organ of perpetual survival. And the real world results are the same. The results of this are nothing short of miraculous. I've seen the clinical examples time and time again. I'm thinking of a young woman who was told her entire life that she was irresponsible and a failure. Within five years of going no contact, she had built a seven-figure online business from scratch. She wasn't a failure. She had just refused to play her family's rigged game. I'm thinking of another client, a man who was constantly called crazy, and emotionally unstable by his family because he dared to call out their abuse. He is now a practicing therapist, using the profound empathy he forged in the fires of his own trauma to help others heal. Their pathologies were never pathologies at all. They were sane reactions to an insane environment. Perhaps the most crucial part of this liberation is the development of authentic relationships. The scapegoat has to learn, often for the first time, what healthy love actually looks. The conditional, transactional, manipulative affection of the narcissistic family is a poor teacher. In its place, they begin to build relationships based on reciprocity, respect, and genuine care.",

They have to build a new family from the ground up, a chosen family that offers the safety and validation their biological family never could. This is also why therapy suddenly becomes exponentially more effective. Attempting therapy while still enmeshed in a narcissistic family system is trying to build a sandcastle during high tide. For every bit of progress you make, a wave of family sabotage, guilt, tripping, and gaslighting comes along and washes it away. But once you've escaped, the therapeutic space becomes a sanctuary, a clean laboratory where real work can finally be done. Without the constant interference and pathology reinforcement, the client and the therapist can form a powerful alliance, and the breakthroughs can come with astonishing speed. What emerges from this process is the true self. For decades, the scapegoat's authentic personality has been buried under layers of shame, guilt, and the false identity projected onto them by the family. The healing process is an archaeological dig. They begin to unearth parts of themselves they never knew existed, hobbies, passions, personality traits, and ambitions that were suppressed because they were threatening to the family system. They discover they have a sense of humor, that they are creative, that they are capable leaders. It is a profound and joyous rediscovery of who they were always meant to be. This aligns perfectly with the research on post-traumatic growth. The idea here is that people who endure severe adversity don't just bounce back to their previous baseline. In many cases, they can bounce forward, developing a level of psychological strength, spiritual depth, and appreciation for life that surpasses their pre-trauma state. Surviving the crucible of narcissistic abuse can forge a kind of wisdom and resilience that is almost impossible to attain otherwise. And this brings us to the ultimate irony of strength. They were called weak, but they were actually carrying the psychological weight of an entire dysfunctional system on their shoulders. Their escape wasn't an act of cowardice. It was an act of Herculean strength. It was the decision to stop carrying a burden that wasn't theirs to carry.",

    "text": "Or maybe they said, would you just need time. All of these are breadcrumbs, psychological hooks. Now you're stuck in a mental loop, wondering if they'll come back, if they meant what they said, if you should wait. And every moment you spend stuck in that loop is a moment where they still win. Even silence from them can be strategic. By not reaching out, they know you'll start asking questions. You'll wonder why they're not chasing you. You realize you allow them to. You'll question if you ever mattered. That vacuum of communication keeps you addicted to thinking about them, because you're trying to fill in the blanks. They might not message you, but they'll still post something provocative, something vague. Or something that makes it look they're happy and thriving without you. It's not random. It's designed to keep you thinking, feeling, and spiraling. The obsession they want isn't just about nostalgia or longing. It's about emotional captivity. They want your healing to be slow. They want your self-worth to depend on their validation. They want your memories of them to interrupt your peace. They want your self-worth to depend on their validation. They want your peace, your sleep, your progress. Because if they can haunt your thoughts, they still matter. And that's their ultimate fear, becoming irrelevant. Is why detaching from a narcissist isn't just about blocking them. It's about reclaiming your inner space. Because as long as they occupy your thoughts, they don't need access to your life to influence it. They've built a version of themselves that they don't need to influence. They're playing themselves inside your head that keeps replaying, rewinding, and analyzing every little detail. And the worst part, you might not even realize you're doing it. You might think it's part of healing. But for a narcissist, your obsession is their delayed supply. It feeds their ego without lifting a finger. even in the quiet, even with no contact, they are still playing the game. It's not with calls, but with the emotional residue they left behind. Counting on you to carry it. Revisit it and relive it. That's what they want to be unforgettable, even if it's through your pain. When a narcissist is met with no contact, they don't see it as a firm boundary.",
