Now, that's the first point is how should we ask this question. It's a good question, but we have to ask it as a question, not as a statement or resentment or resistance. That's the first point. The second point is use the word trigger. Really great word. Now, if I showed you a rifle with a trigger, how big a part of the rifle is the trigger. It's very small. Very small. For that trigger to set off anything, what there has to be, there has to be a mechanism to deliver ammunition. There has to be ammunition. There has to be an explosive charge. When I get triggered, let's say you say something to me and I get triggered, what you said was a very small little thing. I'm the one who's got the explosive charge. And the ammunition, you didn't cause me to do that. If I didn't have that ammunition explosive charge, you could say whatever you want. And I just sit here saying, , I wonder why he's saying that. triggering is a great opportunity to learn. When you get triggered, you could either focus on, resent and resist the trigger, or you could say, huh, what was I still carrying inside that I haven't looked at yet, that I haven't resolved yet. if, , I used to tell the story, , I've been married 53 years now, my wife and I. let's say 20 years ago, I might ask to sleep with her and she would say no, , which is, nobody can ever believe that ever happened, but it did used to happen,. And how would I respond. I would respond by going to a rage and curling into a fetal position and not even wanting to live. Now, the trigger is the no that she said. The explosive is my belief that I'm being rejected. And abandoned and not wanted. And that I'm an infant and helpless. Which is what happened to me. Otherwise, if she says no, oh, I can get curious. Are you tired. Or have I done something to turn you off.",

It keeps giving you the same message. my suggestion, Doug, is next time you hear that voice, say hello to it and say, thank you. what. Because ask yourself, how old is that voice. I mean, how old were you when it first came along. I mean, I was young because I remember there was this idea that I developed about myself from when I was a child that I wasn't good enough because I wasn't picked for sports teams. I got yelled at a lot. give me an age. Five, six, seven. I mean, I would say I was in elementary school, I think. , let's call him a seven-year-old.

It's just a little immature little friend. That's all it is. It didn't come along to torment you. It came along to actually protect you. And I think you're. It's important to have a conversation with that voice and then also change the conversation with that. And then along the lines of , , childhood, one of the things that my audience wanted me to talk to you about more in depth is parenting and that parents are having a hard time now, I think, with their kids growing up in this world that is hard.

    "text": "But what has happened through the gradual evolution of thinking is that now humans tend to overthink. There is a lot of not only unnecessary thinking that generates unnecessary and in many cases non-existent problems such as when you lie awake at night in bed and start worrying. It generates a lot of unnecessary unhappiness. people don't realize that a significant part of the unhappiness in their lives is actually generated by thinking. Unnecessary, negative, often destructive mind activity and they don't even know it. Mindfulness is first of all discovering the simple fact that there is a voice in your head that continuously comments on your life. how positive things you remember, it can be. It depends upon the place that you are in. honestly, I rarely do myself. Suddenly I realized I had made my part. or on what's happening around you. It's the self-talk and everybody knows what the self-talk is in that you talk to yourself. Sometimes you talk to yourself in the first person. I, some people talk to themselves in the second person, you. you can get annoyed with yourself. And then you say, you shouldn't have done that. And then you have another thought and says, yes, but I couldn't help it. And you might even get a third voice come in and whatever it says to this, why can't I get out of my self-talk. That's self-talk too. But it's an amazing first thing, what I call the first awakening, spiritual awakening is something very basic and something very simple. It's the discovery that there is a voice in your head that always talks to you, mostly silently. If it talks out loud, then you're continuously, and there's nobody around, then you are considered insane. And that's only if it's loud, but most people have that inside their heads and they are not considered insane, it's considered normal, but there's not such a big difference. Between the two. And sometimes when you listen to them, there might be a man walking in the street, muttering, oh, this white, this fucking, and you say, oh, he's really insane. But it might be that you are doing the same, but it's just not out loud, it's in your head. Why didn't I, I should have said that. Why didn't I say that.",

    "text": "And for many people, interestingly enough, that self-talk for many people is not always negative, but for many people, it is more negative than positive. A good event that happened yesterday, you might have gone to a nice reunion or you went out into nature and you witnessed a beautiful sunset. You can remember it today and think, that was a beautiful sunset. Or we had a nice talk yesterday. But you can't do that much thinking about a nice event. But the mind, when there's something negative that happens yesterday, somebody offended you or didn't give you the attention that you needed, that you wanted from him, then you can start thinking of, oh my God, what he did, he's really, next time he does that, I'm going to say that, or he's really shown, why doesn't he, why does, you can go on for a long time dwelling on something negative much longer than dwelling on something positive. It is seemingly a negative event is much more food for useless mind activity than a positive event. And this is why for many people, a significant percentage of their mind activity is negative. For some people, it is, oh, it's a good thing, it's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. And for some people, it's almost 100 negative, but it is unlikely that these people would get a job in this company. And I mean that, because your predominant state of consciousness, your predominant mental emotional state, there's a certain correlation between who you associate with, where you find yourself, and even what kind of things happen to you. There is a correlation, which is not always immediately recognizable, but there is a correlation between once a person's predominant mental, emotional state, and who they are with, who their friends are, what, where they work, and even what happens to them. if you are in a very negative state a long time, you tend to attract also negative events, but you can only have to find that out for yourself. I'm not saying believe me. I know it from my own life because when I first discovered this, I was still very young. I discovered that there is a correlation between my mind activity and what happens to me.",

And there for the first time I read about a person's mind and I suddenly realized my mind was predominantly negative because I was a very unhappy child. And my childhood was not pleasant. And the initial conditioning of my life was that my mind was continuously commenting and saying, how bad my life was. And whenever something bad happened to me, I had a phrase that would occur again in my mind. I said, of course, bad things always happen to you, don't they. They're bound to happen to you. It's always happens to you. I was talking to myself and saying that bad things would always happen to me. And they did. you can discover first that the spiritual awakening is to discover, that there is continuous mind activity. And for some people, it's a discovery that a significant part of their mind activity is negative. But the vital thing is to discover that there is this continuous talk in my head, which is considered the normal human state. And of course you cannot abolish thinking. Of course there will be thinking. But the question is, is there an awareness, behind the thinking. If you can become aware that you are indulging or caught up in that useless mind activity, and you suddenly become aware of perhaps certain repetitive thoughts that tend to re-occur in your mind again and again. You might see it in others too. You might see it more easily in others. When you go for your Thanksgiving dinner, I think is it next week, you will meet your family members or relatives. And some of you may realize, you already know what they are going to say this year, because it's the same thing they said last year and five years and 10 years ago. And if they have negative judgments about you or somebody else, then it's the same thing you will hear again next week when you go to them. it's easier to understand. It's easier to see how others are caught up in repetitive thought forms, not as easy to see it in oneself. This is why there's a saying that self-knowledge is the most difficult knowledge. It's easier to see others.",

It's just the ability to realize that there is a voice in your head and that there are thoughts. And you realize that some of those thoughts are negative. And many of those thoughts actually are not only unnecessary, but make your life very difficult, such as worry. most people live with what I call a cluttered mind. A cluttered mind means they are completely unaware that there's a continuous stream of mental commentary that goes wherever they meet somebody and immediately certain judgments form. And everything they feel they need to immediately adopt, they have a position towards it. Immediately say, I'm against it. I dislike it. I that. immediately adapt a mental position and being identified with one's mental position, which is a thought. if you discover within yourself that a lot of the time you are in a state of lack, of insufficiency, of not enough, and you feel that the answer to the remedy is to, be active in this world and achieve and do as much as possible, then you'll probably find that ultimately that is not the answer to your state of lack. In order to transcend, to go beyond your state of lack, of neediness, of not enough, spiritual practice and spiritual realization is necessary. Focus on the realization of being.

How hard is it to help somebody get out of a, if somebody is saying, , I'm in a narcissistic relationship, I'm a narcissist, I'm listening to this. I hear it. I know it. How difficult. Where do you start that process of getting out of it. I actually tell people getting out is not the only path forward. Because I think if we treat that as the only path forward, people who don't see a path out won't seek help. I tell folks, unless there's physical violence and that's a different conversation, let's lift that out. Just, I hate to say just. If there's psychological violence, that's standard in these relationships. But I say to folks. There's no agenda here. Whether you're staying in it, not staying in it, I want to allow you to not get lost in it anymore. That this relationship does not define you. This false, twisted, distorted narrative they've created about you. You being crazy. You being demanding. You being needy. You being extra. It's not true. It allows them to retain dominance in the relationship. it's not true. And you live your life trying to prove it's not true. And the way you do that is you give up on yourself. I don't need anything. I don't need, I can do this all on my own. I, it's. And that's that kind of, that's what happens to people in these relationships. it's helping people find themselves. Now frankly, Tamsen, many times, what ends up happening is as people do that, they may end up finding their way out, but maybe not for another 10 years. But there's a lot of reasons people stay in these relationships. And coming back to your, all the points we've been talking about in midlife, one of them's money. If somebody has left, they left the workplace for a long time. They did not accumulate. this is one thing that I classically see in these relationships is somebody said, , I actually left a career. I focused on our kids. I focused on our family and our household. And I, and his career soared as a result.",

I can't tell you how many people have said to me, we are living in this house, each one is waiting for the other to die, the other one can have the house. And I don't, and I'm not, that's not a joke. , and it's not that either of these people aren't murderous. But they're saying there's no way. We're just toughing it out. We're toughing it out. you try to teach people to bloom out of the relationship. if they've played small, you're trying to make them get bigger. That's the best thing that you can do inside of one of those. Flowers can grow out of pavement. , and then who knows, a narcissist might not stay around if they see somebody that, because that's not what they to do. , if you disengage. And you're asking what are the things people can do. What are the boundaries you can draw around it. Radical acceptance. Narcissistic people don't really change, and they sure as hell don't change when they're in their 50s and 60s and 70s. That's what I was gonna ask. Do they ever change. No. Listen, are there unicorns. Sure, there's unicorns,. This is not the unicorn show. This is the what happens to most people show,. And what happens to most people is it doesn't change, and it actually gets sometimes a little bit, when I say worse with age, I think some of the stubbornness, especially as a narcissistic person is losing some of their power in the world, they're getting older and all these things,. it's not gonna change. Stop engaging with it will. people are , I want them to know. I'm , they're not listening to you. They haven't listened to you in 30 years.

We planted, production planted all those cornfields too. They're as far as the eye could see. And this is the road Cooper drives up on the way out.

What would you do a father leaving children to go do what they know they were meant to do and leave this earth and then from there on time changes. At the end of this shoot, when it was wrapped and it was clear, we had no more shots, no more scenes on this location. My family and I were in my Airstream on the set. It was where we lived. We got, , at the edge of base camp, we turned our Airstream to face out to the mountains. And behind us is your medical and your food, whatever you need from production. But we stayed extra few days and just hiked it and stuff. And one of the things that was fun is I let my son probably, I don't know what leave I was seven, eight at the time. We got in my truck and I let him drive through these cornfields. It's fast. He replicated just when he was going 360 and all around. Cause I had checked, I was , they go, no, it's for as far as you can see. It's just the salt flats hit it. And I've got some video of that and some pictures. It was top. Unreal.

And there's nine symptoms of which a person needs five. And I'm going to crunch these down. What are some of the key traits that drive high performance are also the ones at the very core of narcissism. If you were in a stadium, what percentage of people are narcissists. 15 to 16 percent. And if you were to walk into the halls of a world-class football team or world-class basketball, coaches slash athlete mix. 20 to 25 percent. Wow. Welcome back or welcome to the Finding Mastery podcast, where we dive into the minds of the world's greatest thinkers and doers. I am your host, Dr. Michael Gervais, by trade and training, a high performance psychologist. Now, the idea behind these conversations is simple, to sit with the extraordinaries, to really learn about how they work from the inside out. Today's conversation is one that hits deep, and I am pleased to welcome Dr. Ramani Dravosula, clinical psychologist, professor, and leading expert on narcissism. when a person is in a relationship with someone who's narcissistic, the most common experiences we witness are self-blame, self-doubt, isolation, anxiety, depression. I hate to say it, but destroying a person's psyche is a pretty straightforward process. Dr. Ramani shares her model for navigating these relationships. She explains the different types of narcissism and how gender shapes their expression. The girls are allowed to be able to express emotions. What we still have not figured out is how to hold space for men and boys to be vulnerable without pathologizing them as weak. And without that vent, I do think that the grandiose and the malignant narcissism are more likely than to be expressed. Dr. Ramani's insights are powerful, practical. They're grounded in years of clinical research and personal experience too. , speak to the person that's in a relationship with somebody who's narcissistic. How do you help guide them. Stay or go. the stay or go conversation, I tend to be agnostic. I say. With that, let's jump into this week's conversation with Dr. Ramani Jervasula. I'm really looking forward to this conversation. I think I spend a lot of time with narcissists. And. Given what you do, , you do. ,. , you do. I. , there's a lot to unpack here.",

I decided to take a leap into the unknown and educate these, these clients about narcissism. That was the aha moment, they said, Wait a minute, this thing has a name. And the minute they realized it had a name, and it was a thing, they really kind of came back from the precipice of feeling crazy. And when they when it really was why they were stuck, why they couldn't get unstuck, why the world saw this person one way, and they were having a different experience.

And you're not being locked in. And the problem was, and this is what was compelling to me, narcissism is different than addiction. Or if you were to partner with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, those are viewed as problem states,. Being an addict is not healthy being living with a major mental illness is not healthy. But narcissism is different. These people were charming, charismatic, confident, they look good on paper, they were over represented in leadership. to the world, these people were the proverbial catch.

I think girls are actually still to this day told to sort of dial it down a little bit in terms of, , the, , the even on the field, the kind of if I can curse the shit talking and stuff that, girls are tend not to be socialized to do that as much. Nor do girls tend to lean into behaviors physical bullying and physical intimidation. That stuff is probably going to code more towards grandiose and malignant narcissism. And I think that's the thing that I think is really important to think about is that there are certain traits and qualities that are more tolerated in men. Whereas the vulnerable narcissism that that patterning can is actually experienced in both men and women and most clients I've worked with who've had narcissistic mothers almost, almost without exception, it's been a vulnerable narcissistic I wrote a white paper for a protein that I was working with on how to hit I didn't want to call it borderline or narcissism, I said how to handle difficult personalities. And it works Clo j o m. And it can create that sense of shame. And if there's one other than protecting all children from trauma, if we did that, we'd probably erase narcissism. But until we're not doing that on my watch, I wish we could, I'd be out of a job. All of us would be out of a job. But in the absence of that, creating many, many more experiences for boys, especially starting in middle school, to be more emotionally vulnerable. I think the little guys, they're able to do it. little boys can be emotionally vulnerable and available. You hit those hormones. And what we still have not figured out is how to bridge that gap into puberty, where sexuality and emotions and hormones and all of that are raging. And that we as a culture do not hold, I don't think any culture does it , hold space for men and boys to be vulnerable without pathologizing them as weak. And without that vent, I do think that the grandiose and the malignant narcissism are more likely than to be expressed.",

Think of an event where you were in one of these states. What does it look. Because it really personalizes it for you. How does your body feel in this particular state. What would you call this state. What are your own words for it. for me, I put congruent and aware. For sympathetic, I call it over-functioning, annoyed. Flustered. Action. Doing the things. Making the list. Pushing myself through the discomfort. And then what kind of coping skills do you use. I do a lot of running. I do the list making. I do the yelling. I try to be breathing during that time, but it's hard. I do a lot of victimizing, , oh, poor me and my giant list of things that I have to do, that righteous indignation that I'm completely overwhelmed. And it's everybody's fault.

The story I tell myself is not, not only am I not, functioning anymore, I'm under functioning and I'm now a failure. I've, I've crossed into failure zone. it's every nervous system is different. it's really important that you take the time and it might be surprising to you to find out the stories you tell yourself in these nervous system states.

And conversely, if I can show up in a room and be calmer, and use calm eye contact, slow body movements, slow breathing, validating comments, affirming comments, my down regulated nervous system will help your nervous system match. engage that social ventral vagal system, you need social connection, safe face to face connection, you do as scary as it is need intimacy, you need to go to a place in space where you can share your story usually has to be with other people who suffered and struggled in a similar way they can understand and they can hear it and validate it in a non judgmental way.

And over time, I get less dysregulated in the first place and slower to get dysregulated when something happens to kind of set it off. Now it's good to have a daily practice, but you also need something you can anytime on the spot use when you need it because whoops, you just slipped into dysregulation. It's good to master this. You can master these skills because if you stay dysregulated, it can be exhausting. It can keep you from remembering very who you spoke to and what happened during your day. It can make it hard to connect with other people and it can leave you vulnerable to intense emotions that are way oversized emotional dysregulation only because normal size feelings are running through a dysregulated nervous system. you could end up lashing out or having inexplicable sadness at the worst possible time. Or talking more than you really want to in a social situation. Those are forms of dysregulation too. Or driving off from the gas station with the gas pump still in your car. Have you done that. I did it twice in a single week. It wasn't good. They were really mad at the gas station and they had to charge me money. But as long as you can notice that you're dysregulated, there's something that you can do about it away. Here's what I call emergency measures to re-regulate. Now I've been collecting these and I've got some new ones for you. let me go over all of them. I've got 14. First, notice when you're dysregulated. Are you flooding with emotion. Do you feel filled with adrenaline. Are you panicking. Say to yourself, I'm having an emotional reaction. This is a good time to slow down and be gentle with yourself and other people that you don't say or do something that you'll regret later. Number two is be safe. Be safe.

    "text": "If what triggered you was an argument, use gentle words to stop the interaction for now. I want to continue this conversation, but I need to take a breather to calm down. Or if you don't want to tell the other person that you're triggered, tell them that you need a bathroom break. Or if you're on the phone, you can say you have a call on the other line. Don't get into a big discussion about it while you're dysregulated. Just find a way to put the conversation on pause. Number three, buy some time. Separate from the other person if you can. Go to a room by yourself, even if it's the bathroom. No one has to know what you're doing. If it feels urgent to express yourself and get out there and argue, take an even longer break before you try to resolve anything. True emergencies are rare, and there are very few problems that can't be solved a little later when your emotions are regulated again. Number three. Don't be afraid to step back. Number four is stamp your feet. You would be amazed how helpful it is to bring yourself back into present time in your body as you stamp each foot. Say quietly to yourself, , left, , left. And this helps your brain begin to re-regulate. Number five. Take 10 deep breaths, focusing particularly on the out breath. Six. Press your tongue to the back of your teeth. This is a strategy to get back in your body too. Number seven. Sit down and feel the weight of your butt in the chair. that. This is another strategy to get back inside your body, which by the way is a metaphor. You are always in your body. But to feel that you're there, to be present, to feel your limbs, to occupy all the limbs of your body. All. Number eight. Stand up and shake it off. This is called somatic shaking. It's this. And you just kind of bounce up and down on your knees and let everything shake. And it can be funny. It can be relaxed. It can be silly if you want. You can swing your arms and just kind of enjoy the feeling of jiggling and shaking a hundred sticky little ping pong balls are falling off all around you. All.",

And I closed my eyes and I tried to feel what part of my body was tense and needs relief. And I would dance until I was exhausted and I couldn't do it anymore. And the person who wrote this comment said, I found this very helpful. And I just think that's one of the perfect forms of emergency measures to re-regulate. Very relaxing, very fun, very natural. All. Number 10. Eat something. When you're stressed, you'll probably crave carbs and sugar. But it's protein foods that will help you get grounded again. make sure you have some of those. Number 11.

And you can wash your face with the water, even if you're just, , standing by the sink, get water on your face. I think we all naturally are inclined to do that. You can also make a bowl with water and ice and put your hands in the ice and feel the ice or get that ice water up on your face, too.

    "text": "You're not going to be able to do a lot of things in your life. You're not going to be able to do a lot of things in your life. there's orthogonal brain activation. au Now in this stage of healing you learn to notice when dysregulation is happening what are the signs that you have it, what are the triggers that seem to set it off. And this begins a huge wave of growth for the people I coach. These are supposed to develop a very short time. And they just don't happen and the production starts just to manifest. that's what it did for me too. They'll often say dysregulation oh my god that is what I have, that is what is throwing me off every time and if you have that is very probably what's made it almost impossible to stop making those same mistakes or to solve the problems in your life that just seem to hang around and get worse even though you're doing everything a person is supposed to do. It's the dysregulation and guess what you can learn to re-regulate. You can learn to do that and it's strange at first and it'll surprise the heck out of you to find that simple techniques can stop a trigger from turning into a big upset and then a full day or three days of dysregulation. You might still get dysregulated but you'll notice it sooner and you'll turn it around more quickly and then you can get back to being and doing what you're doing. When you're regulated you're a lot less likely to lose your temper or have an anxiety attack or feel overwhelmed. Is that a big one for you. You have a way out from all that and when you're free many things in life become possible. Now I love teaching people about this in my coaching program because it's one thing to read about how to re-regulate or to watch a video about it but being in a small group just connecting every week with people who know you, sharing what you're trying, what you're noticing, having people hear you and be happy for you and sharing what they're discovering about what works. I get to see this light go on in everyone's life and I'm oh my god I'm happy for you.",

    "text": "It's easy to fall back on the trauma-driven thinking and behavior. It happens, but then we get up and we keep trying. And it helps if you understand this and you're open to it and you're willing to let the light burn a little brighter in you, even when that feels pointless, even when it feels it will never work. You keep turning your effort toward the good and making it your intention, whether you can see the next steps or not. With healing, you become willing to just keep putting one foot in front of the other, one next good action after another. And then you look around and you'll see you're walking the path of good. Now, if you can do that, there's been a great for the entire universe. Terrible things have been done by humans. And then great things have come to pass to undo the terrible things. Our human consciousness, we're trapped into it, whether we want to be or not. We inherit the capacity for every form of evil. Where people have descended into genocide, that could have been us. But in healing, we stop that. The evil action that tries to weave through the generation stops here. It's not easy. It's not automatic. We've all got the capacity to be just the worst people who ever lived. We're no different. Who is to say if we had their DNA and their life experiences and their brainwashing, we wouldn't be just the worst people in history. Most of us will never become killers, I hope, but we'll be haters. We will. We have been. That hate that we toy with when we get into road rage or political hate or being characterized. We're not above that. That's the same impulse. The murderous impulse. If you let it keep going, it goes all the way to the worst. To genocide, in fact. We're not above that. And in fact, I sometimes notice that traumatized people can be very, very drawn to extreme thinking and rhetoric of hate. And it can feel at times it's the answer. See, I'm such a good person. All these other people here, they're bad.",

    "text": "that's hate that's grandiosity that's what we're capable of we've all seen it we've all done it and it feels really seductive when you're depressed to swap the feeling of depression out for hate is animating hate feels more alive at those times it feels more powerful it is more powerful than depression and it gets you up out of a torpor it gives you a cause to go get out there and f up those bad people over there at any cost and this is where trauma comes from this is where it comes from people blind with anger blind with acting out on their own internalized trauma hate is not the answer and acting out is not the answer either if you want to heal i'd recommend you be very careful not to tear other people down don't jump into bitter feuds with people who online you don't want to be a victim of a trauma you don't want to be a victim of a trauma if you feel the need to tell other people about the bad things someone else has done someone or a stranger double check your facts before you do it check your motives don't personally do anything that you feel that you have to lie about don't be stubborn when what's needed is an apology or a kind word or letting go of whatever you were holding against somebody else stand up for those who aren't able to stand up for themselves people who are not in the room when somebody else is trapped in a situation where they're not able to stand up for themselves that's a big online attack and don't use hostility where what you really need are boundaries healing is the answer when you heal your trauma you heal yourself you heal all your future relationships you heal your possibilities you heal your destiny and you brighten your light when you do this you're light do what i mean by light that's the energy and love that you bring into the world with the little things that you do maybe the big things you do too your light ripples out to affect all men and women everywhere all who have ever lived really and all who will live your light is the most real thing about you it has not given up on you it is yours to nurture yours to bask in yours to develop yours to share and this is how good wins you make it a priority a sacred thing and you make it a priority and you make it a priority to heal your trauma wounds you may not know how to do that yet and that's why it's good you're here with all of us the people in the comment section me my team the people in my courses and my membership all the little lights here are shining together and we help each other we lift each other up when one person starts to go down starts to turn negative we pull them back in we revere the good and we heal ourselves that we can give a hand to the next people we meet who need that good wins in the end but it needs us to try for it we have to aim for it people ask me sometimes your daily practice techniques are nice and everything but how long is it going to take me to heal or i don't see why i have to keep working on myself when no one else has to and you're no one has to many people don't but everyone can and i hope you will because there's nothing more important than overcoming and undoing the evil that was done to you and sometimes i see healing grass we're blades of grass that and it's as if we got stuck for a whole season under a black tarp and the grass didn't die but it can't grow and it seems dead bad grass it's all yellow and stringy under there and there's little pill bugs and worms and then one day you lift up the tarp you have the power to do that when you're healing and the sun shines on the grass the sun can't not shine on the grass it's natural and you can't do that you can't do that you can't do that you can't do that you can't do that you can't do that you can't do that and the grass is natural and the rain falls on it and in not very much time the grass begins to come back and it becomes what it was always meant to be it's grass it's green it's strong it's abundant that's what it's meant to be you are that you're designed to heal just the grass you just need water and sun and what is that you can think of water as the tools that you use to name and release the bad thing to become free of it the bad kind of grief and loneliness that grind you down and drive you towards the worst things you've ever done loneliness does that my tools personally are the daily practice techniques that i teach a lot of you do those techniques with me and if you haven't tried them and you need some tools they're lovely for washing away the fearful and resentful thoughts that trauma generates and that can drive you when you haven't healed yet the links are always down in the description section the sunshine you can think of as the loving atmosphere that supports your healing the warmth with a little luck you're going to meet people who are walking this path with you and that's what we've cultivated here on this channel and then the programs i offer which you can always find in the description section if you want to check them out for yourself you need water and sunshine tools and support you may have thought that nothing good would ever happen again but with tools and loving support you can't help but start standing in this top corner is where this lifengs yourcountry is where this workshop Radio is where this passion can be found it is where it can be following the advice received to be the feet of the Dazu or in the words ofingly affiliate heatson or the Built by Cliff in, I'm scared where this is going, but you might start to find as you feel safer because you have less fear and resentment that you can just sort of without knowing exactly where you're going, you can start yielding to the current of the good and let it begin to change your life in a positive direction.",

Now it's not your fault that you were abused and neglected and bullied as a kid but sooner or later you realize that no one is coming to fix that for you. Even if you could make all these problems stop existing in the world the injury already happened and now it's in your hands to begin working on that injury to change your life from exactly where you are now. It's a good place to start. Now some of you will get angry when I say that. You'll unsubscribe, you'll say terrible things in the comments, you'll shut off the video and that's because I'll still be here when that little glimmer of hope will come back. But I'm not going to let that happen. I'm going to let it get to where it is that whatever glimmer of good shows up in your life and you want to come back and whether you want it or not hope is going to appear. Hope is here. Maybe things can get better. this is a powerful and positive sign when you feel hope that even though you may be discouraged and demoralized now the truth of you is very much alive and there's a great of strength in you, a light, and not only is it meant to shine but it's meant to shine now. It's shining now. Can you feel that. dissolve cynicism. Hopelessness gets diluted by hope. Hope has a way of growing. All , how. What are you even talking about, Anna. People are going to be , all , enough about that. What do I do. What do I do. Your demoralization is a heavy cloak. All , think of it that way. It presses you down, it covers you, it makes everything feel heavy and impossible. It keeps you from knowing that you can actually take it off. Demoralization tends to follow certain patterns. It manifests in a handful of problems, ordinary human weaknesses that can become big problems. They can dominate your life. Things avoidance, anger, indifference, overwhelm, isolation, escapism, and blame. Demoralization loves more than anything when you blame. And you might recognize some of these things in yourself. And if you're demoralized, you're going to tell me, but I have to. Be angry.",

And the people I asked for help wanted to get me to not look at that. I think they thought I was too vulnerable to face my own responsibility for some of the problems in my life. And at that point, it was a lot me who was generating the problems. But I was in denial. And I think I was getting helped by some of the people that I was paying to help me.

    "text": "Nothing else could work because my thinking and my actions and my beliefs, the way I affected other people was, it was confusing to me because I was demoralized and I was demoralized because of what I was doing. A demoralized mind can't easily see an alternative or come back from demoralization. Something has to show you the alternative. , sometimes by grace, it will be shown to you. You will stumble into it and go, what. I could be better than this. But sometimes it's just a person. If you need me, I'll be the person. If you need me, I'll be the person. If you need me, I'll be the person. Who suggests to you that you take a look at the signs of demoralization in your life and spend some time with them and then decide if you're ready to turn away from them. Here's a simple thing you can do. It's called contrary action. You may not know yet exactly where you need to end up, but it's enough to know you want to turn away from what you're doing now and begin to basically do the opposite. , let's go over those signs I mentioned of demoralization, avoidance, anger, indifference, overwhelm, isolation, escapism, and blame. I'm going to describe them to you and then I will tell you how to turn each one around using contrary actions, the opposite. Now you actually have the power to do that. And yes, everyone has circumstances that are challenging to one degree or the other. Big problems, I know. But this is about finding that little light inside, that little ray of hope. And it's about most of all action. And I know a lot about action because for all the thinking and reading and talking that I ever did about my problems, the thing that ever made a difference for me was the actions I took. Now I spent a lot of my life demoralized and what changed was not my circumstances first, it was me who changed. All. Now, if this bothers you hearing me talk about how I did it, when I, , instead of blamey talk or flowery talk or little Instagram wisdom, just straight talk on how to actually take action to make your life new, then this is not a good video.

And then I'll tell you the contrary action, the thing that you can do to remoralize yourself around that problem. Number one, avoidance. This is very popular with people who are traumatized as kids. People are triggering, commitments are triggering. we end up just pulling away and avoiding it. Your contrary action is to show up, to get clear about what you need to be doing. And people who are not sure what to do, they're not sure what to do. And you're going to have to who you need to stay connected with. You also are going to want to stay connected to the actions, just the little tasks in your daily life that keep your life moving. what is it paying a bill, apologizing to someone, returning a phone call, spending a full evening with someone you love without looking at your phone or watching TV. , you can make a list of these things and then prioritize the things that you really need to be taking action on. Make those appointments, follow through on them. Every Sunday night, make a new list. That's what I do, Sunday nights. All. The second sign of demoralization is anger. Now, I don't have to explain what anger is. It's something that people with complex PTSD often have too much of. It comes out and hurts people. Your contrary action is to release those resentful thoughts that hold your thinking in an iron grip of anger and block you from feeling joy. If you want a way to loosen up your anger, I strongly encourage you to do that. I'm going to give you a couple of tips that you can use to help you get rid of anger. the first one is to try my daily practice techniques. And you may want to write that down for after you finish the video. I will definitely put a link at the end of this video. And it's always down in the description section if you want to learn these techniques to free yourself of fearful and resentful thinking. But these techniques are deceptively simple.

    "text": "god help my lungs then i stopped and it took a lot of tries to stop but i did stop i have a video about that i'll try to remember to put that down below if you want to see it but at first i would stop smoking i'd start i'd stop i'd start and then one day i had the power to renounce it all i told you we talked about renouncing and i was able to use the contrary action and in my case that was to start doing my daily practice techniques twice a day for real without fail and then the anger and the fear began to leave me i couldn't trust it until i knew with certainty that the daily practice would keep working for me that it would be a reliable way to feel better as needed and not turn out to be some crazy cult thing that just failed everything else took a few years for me to really trust that and that's when the smoking stopped it's now been 26 years as i stand here taping this almost exactly 26 years this month all number four overwhelm this is still one that's hard for me it's a sign of demoralization it also leads to demoralization i think that's probably true of all the signs they are caused by demoralization and they cause worse demoralization i'm the queen of overwhelm it still happens when i let myself get demoralized my life which is full and good and interesting instantly becomes too much for me and i hate my life and i get mad and i start procrastinating and i hate my life i'm not going to do anything about it i'm going to do it i'm going to do it i'm going to do it i'm going to do it i'm going to do it i'm going to do it i'm going to do it i'm going to do it i'm going to do it and i'm hyperventilating and dysregulating and i'm no use to anybody the contrary action for me is to slow down i make a list i lists you may not i do i have a little digital thing called kanban flow it's it's it's a free app if it costs money i'd get a deal where i get kickbacks every time i recommend this to people because i think thousands of people are using it but it's it's really simple and you can just make these columns make little tasks you can slide them into other columns you can name the columns you can color code things i do that for how long it takes it's it's just totally how i handle things every morning i just get up and look at my board and i see what i've got and i just love noodling with it and it's it's got all these nether regions off screen if you were to scroll all the way over it's oh here's some old stuff i meant to do two years ago one thing that's always on my list is to clean up the board and i never do but it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it is enough that i keep this area of it clear of what i'm going to do and in fact taping these videos is on it today and it's color-coded pink because it was going to take me two and a half hours i already know that if you have childhood ptsd it can feel good to just take one thing at a time your brain loves it when you slow down and you do things one thing at a time you don't have to be methodical all day long you could just get this way when you get overwhelmed i don't know you might want to do an ounce of prevention but when you're overwhelmed just consider it time to slow down and start doing things one thing at a time that whole multitasking thing they say oh it's a myth that multitasking is possible or good but i think that's also a misc myth it's sometimes we multitask successfully sometimes we're too dysregulated and we just need to slow down and just be mr rogers about it sit down take out the shoes take off the shoes put on the shoes tie the laces it feels good it's very calming and regulating for your mind if your cptsd is shaped kind of mine sometimes you get emotionally or mentally overwhelmed when you're hurried when everyone's talking to you at once when there's a big deadline coming up or something really exciting happened when that feeling that you're just getting overwhelmed is rising up in you renounce it just say that's this is overwhelm I renounce overwhelm I'm not into it anymore and allow yourself to pause and have new opportunities a new way of dealing with it enter into your imagination pause imagine just let something new come you'll get things done faster this way it's true try it all five another sign of demoralization is isolation oh this is the favorite around here this is the biggest and most universal trauma symptom it's a natural response to feeling triggered around people not trusting yourself it's a little avoidance is not doing tasks isolation is not doing people and you can't if you can't gracefully handle things because your CPTSD symptoms get out into the room then trauma it's an injury it's injuring you it's holding you back it's an injury to your ability to connect and connections feel fraught and not connecting with people you're not connecting with people you're not connecting with people you're not connecting with people you're not connecting with people here's the problem it can make it impossible to heal that instinct might be to pull away from people to deal with all those triggers but it's only gonna get worse if you stop dealing with people the contrary action is to in a measured way not all at once you don't just throw yourself into the center of the party if this is hard for you if it's triggering for you it's to connect with people a little at a time every day and this is a huge part of what I teach and in my connection with people it's to connect with people a little at a time every day and this is a huge part of what I teach and in my connection boot camp and if it's a big issue for you might want to check that course out i'll be sure there's a link down in the description section for you on that you need to simultaneously work to calm your triggers and then also work that muscle of connecting with people calm yourself connect calm connect calm connect call it titration which is from medicine and science a little at a time see how you do a little more see how you do all number six another sign of demoralization is escapism and this is where we try to get away from the pain of our present reality and away from anxiety about what might happen in the future by using fantasies or drugs or booze or running away or quitting things or magical thinking or making up platitudes to justify huge problems it's all good or monogamy is for losers anyway or he abuses me but that's because he was wounded by his mother when he was a kid and he needs me to stand by him that's magical thinking when you live demoralized and you've lost touch with the difference between what is good and healthy and what is what is irresponsible and evil you can justify just about anything you want and this is dangerous because not only can it hurt you it can hurt other people and it will further damage your awareness of good it just chips away and grinds you down creates the illusion that good is your enemy you run into people who really think that their thinking is distorted all finally the ugliest result of demoralization number seven is blame demoralization thrives when you don't have the strength to face your own mistakes and instead you place the blame on other people in your life even if it takes wild stretches of your imagination to do it now healing has a fighting chance when you take serious time for self-examination when you question all your problems and ask yourself which part of this have i created.",

that you could change and this is your magic sweet spot because what you can change is what you can change you can't change the circumstances necessarily you can't change other people you can't change the past but you can change these decisions you make the attitude you took the words you said you can work on those things much of the time that is enough you change what is your thing you can fix the cybersecurity or fix your life you can fix the one little thing and the rest of it melts away or they fall away or the people who are that just leave your life now a lot of people fear looking at their part in problems but it's actually really safe because it just goes without saying that when it happened you didn't know any better there was something going on in you that you couldn't really manage a different choice at that time and most of your problems they were created for you by the people who abused you that beam of light that hope that comes when you find a piece of the problem that these days you have the ability to change this is precious when i first started doing this when i first discovered how potent it was to look at my part in problems i just went wild i just wanted to blame myself for everything and not out of self-attack but because it was such a high to go oh my gosh i have control over something i just wanted to control over everything which of course i don't have you don't have now over time i could see that not everything was my fault but those that were very powerful i had to only take care of my own life my family a lot of my loved ones and my change a little bit about myself before a whole bunch of stuff started changing a domino effect that's why it's easier than it seems you look at all your problems at once and you're just how will i ever hack through all of these it's just start with one start with something that you can change see what happens growing up traumatized breaks your ability to connect with people it breaks down moral order it damages your perception your discernment about your relationships and in that void it's easy to be driven by fear and anger and resentment and blame everyone pays the price when one of us becomes separated from what's good if you're ready to change to heal your life and become a source of hope for other people ask yourself are you ready to take a step up and renounce these negative aspects of yourself even if you don't know how to change you don't know where it's headed you don't know what it's supposed to look just begin and take the first contrary action that you can see in front of you can't help but have that lead to a revelation of what your second step is going to be it's walking in a fog at first if you can see one thing just do it where you are don't you don't have to know the root cause you don't have to know the other steps just the thing that you can see needs fixing that you feel you could possibly try that start where you are your life is important your experience can be used for good and with healing you're going to have more focus and more energy to do it if you've been reading my blog or watching my videos or taking my courses you're probably in a place where you're going deeper than you have before and being bolder about facing some of the really hard stuff in your past and hopefully you've been able to get even more honest with yourself than you have before about not just how you're affected by childhood ptsd but about your own behaviors that are flowing from that traumatized place and sabotaging you and if you're trying to change that now you're probably finding out how hard that is most people with childhood ptsd they're affected by trauma and neglect and they just stay affected some problems tend to get better as we age but most of them don't and some of this stuff if you let it go on and on it'll start making you weird i think we all know some older people who had maybe some ordinary quirks in their personality but they never dealt with it and as time goes by they get weird they get mean or insanely judgmental or paranoid and that contributes to them being isolated in fact i'm not sure how many of you are me we only get to avoid changing by staying isolated i think there are a handful of people who will just get lucky and spontaneously heal or they'll meet this incredible person who changes their inner lives and softens their edgy personalities but for most of us change is only going to happen if we pretty much throw ourselves into an honest fact finding about everything we're doing that's making life harder and then being unprecedentedly brave about doing something about it and it's been my experience that even when i go full tilt a hundred percent in this direction there's some stuff i haven't been able to change about myself and one example is or was smoking my last cigarette was on may 26 1997 and the fact that i stopped was a miracle and something i know without a shadow of a doubt i could not have done unless some kind of spiritual power had made it happen.",

I smoked when I visited my mom while she was dying of lung cancer. I smoked while I was spraying bleach cleaner on a moldy wall and I was inhaling the particles.

It's in your hair, it's in your clothes. And smoking almost certainly caused the development of my reactive airway. And you're actually hearing the results of that today.

It's pretty serious. And in fact, when I received radioactive iodine as a treatment, they said, , don't smoke. But of course I couldn't not smoke. I was a physical wreck at this low point in my life at that time and getting radiation treatment to actually kill the thyroid tissue. My muscles were wasted. I was really stressed out.

When you have fear and resentment, you might repeat yourself, or you might start talking louder and louder, kind of verbally bullying someone that they keep listening, whether they want to or not, whether they feel that you've answered your concern or not, you might start interrupting them because you're afraid that you're not being heard.

Because when you're dysregulated, it's hard to even hear what they're saying, let alone think of how you're supposed to act. Dysregulation gets activated when you're confronted with stressors and crises. And remember, it can suppress your ability to reason while it amps up your emotions. you see how this explains much why those of us with childhood PTSD appear to keep making the same bad choices over and over, even when we say we're never going to do it again. And we do mean we're never going to do it again. But then you look around and there you are, you're doing it again. I'm here to tell you, you can break this cycle. You really are capable of making good choices and good changes. And it gets way easier when you learn to re-regulate. how do when to stop. how do when dysregulation is happening. Let's start with the regulated state and what that feels. When you're calm, brain activity is even, and it's driving body responses and emotions in an even and predictable way. But when strong emotions trigger dysregulation, it can feel a bad chemical just started running through your body. And I've noticed it feels a little bit a migraine coming on. If you get migraines, there's a moment where , it's coming and it's too late to turn back. Dysregulation is that. Or sometimes it feels what I've never had a seizure, but it's what I imagine a seizure feels before it starts. something is starting to rise up in your, in your nervous system. And it's getting ready to kind of take over. Your thinking changes and you can go into reactivity. You might withdraw and go silent or get confused and blurt things out. Or panic. It's hard to perceive accurately what's going on in those moments. , wait a minute, what just happened. And you might totally misread whether another person is angry or not, or dangerous or safe.

    "text": "the trick to noticing dysregulation is to recognize the signs, and they might be a little different in different ways. They might be a little different in different people. here are some clues. You feel spaced out. You're at a loss for words. You can't remember where you are. You feel scattered. You're trying to do a lot of things at once, but you're finishing nothing. You're tripping over things, dropping things, losing things, your keys, your purse. Your voice and facial expression go flat. Or you're in a rage, or you feel a huge urgency to express what is bothering you. You can't feel parts of your body. You can't feel hands, mouth, face, nose, feet, for example. And dysregulation often begins with a flood of emotion. You get very upset or scared from something that's said or something that happens. But sometimes the trigger isn't anything that you notice. It could be your hormones or a feeling of exhaustion or just waking up in the morning. That could set it off. Setting off, by the way, that's what we call a trigger. And we're not using triggers. And we're not using trigger in the common sense of the word that a lot of people use for upset. I'm talking about something that happens that sets off neurological dysregulation. You can see why it's hard to control your dysregulation at first. that's what it's to be dysregulated. The most important question is what can you do to re-regulate as quickly as possible and stay regulated. first, notice you're dysregulated. If you can do this one thing, you can control your negative impulses. And give yourself the time and space to re-regulate before you begin saying anything or doing anything that could be destructive. Are you flooding with emotion. Are you going numb. Say to yourself, I'm getting dysregulated. Number two, be safe. This is not a good time to drive a car. You should pull over. I'm serious. And take your time. Don't go running into a crosswalk or try to use heavy equipment. Give all your focus to getting yourself into a safe environment. A physically safe place where you can pause and re-regulate. Number three, if you are threatened with violence, some of this is not going to apply. just return all your focus to getting yourself into a physically safe place, whatever it takes.",

    "text": "Number four, if what triggered you was an argument, instead of escalating the fight, you can use gentle words to stop the interaction. At least temporarily. you can say, I want to continue this conversation, but I need to take a breather to calm down. Or if you don't want to tell the other person that you're triggered, tell them you need a bathroom break. Or if you're on the phone, say you have a call on the other line, and then call them back later. When you need to step back from a situation, you don't have to get into a big discussion about it. Because remember, talking about it can actually make dysregulation worse. just find a way to put the conversation on pause. Number six, then by some time, separate from the other person if you can. Go to a room by yourself. Even if it's the bathroom or a car, no one has to know what you're doing. If it feels urgent to express yourself, maybe you want to lash out, take even longer before you try to resolve anything. Number seven is a quick technique. Stamp your feet on the floor. You'd be amazed how helpful it is to bring yourself back into present time, into your body. And as you stamp each foot, you can say quietly to yourself, , left, , left. And this helps your brain begin to re-regulate. Number eight is take ten deep breaths, focusing on the out-breath, if you. Some people say that's more relaxing and engages the parasympathetic nervous system. Number nine, another measure that you can take that no one knows you're doing, is you can press your tongue to the back of your teeth. that. It just, again, it helps you get into your body. Along the same lines, you can sit down and feel the weight of your butt in the chair. This is one more way to get back inside your body. , eleven is, sometimes, what you need is something to eat. When you're stressed, you'll probably crave carbohydrates and sugar, but it's protein foods that will help you get grounded again. Drink some water.

But if no one is around, or you don't feel being touched, you can try pressing your back into the corner. Not where the walls are behind you. Just press yourself into the corner. Wrap your arms around yourself that you can feel pressure all around your torso. We're wired to calm down when we're hugged. And that's it. You now have a whole bunch of things that you can do when you notice you're dysregulated. And at the end of this video, I'll give you a link to a download, where it's all written down you can keep those tips with you. Now, some people ask, is medication helpful for treating dysregulation. Some researchers have said yes, some say no, but given that we now know that the underlying problem with a lot of childhood PTSD symptoms, , it's not a chemical imbalance per se, that's corrected by the introduction of chemicals. Rather, it's brain dysregulation. there's evidence that some medications can actually do more harm than good. And one of the reasons may be that they interfere with our natural ability to re-regulate after a period of dysregulation. if you think about it, everybody gets dysregulated sometimes, and everyone eventually re-regulates. With CPTSD, we tend to get dysregulated more often and for longer periods of time. the goal is to learn to re-regulate as soon as you notice it, and then to stay regulated more of the time. That's the first part of the solution. The second part, then, with your nice, fresh, regulated mind, is to work on the behaviors and circumstances that flowed out of you living your life, dysregulated all this time. The childhood trauma happened, and you definitely were affected, but this is the stuff that holds you back now, the dysregulation and the self-defeating behaviors. that's the essence of what I teach in my courses and coaching programs, and my upcoming book, Learn to Re-Regulate Your Brain and Emotions, and I teach people how to do that. And while it's important to acknowledge what happened to you and get some support for that, the real work of healing is going to be the healing of life problems that are holding you back today.",

I'd had 14 major surgeries in just all of this was in a few years. And as everything was falling apart, I looked around for help, for support, for someone to show up with soup or sit with me on the worst day. And people would show up, sort of, , they'd come, they'd bring something, they'd talk for a little bit. But it's just that these hardships, these surgeries and stuff, they just kept happening. And after a while people stopped coming. And then I was alone. I had no real friends, not the kind who show up, not the kind you can call in a crisis. They're just, , people I knew. And I had been there for some of them, but it just turned out not to be a reciprocal relationship. They were people I'd seen at work or at events or in passing, but no one, , who I could lean on when I needed it the most. And this hit me , , a punch in the chest. I had built my whole life this way and I had to face that. , I was friendly with everyone, but I was close to no one. And it wasn't that I didn't want friends. I wanted them desperately, but something was in the way. Some invisible membrane. That's what it felt. Something between me and other people. And I finally had to ask myself the question I'd been avoiding for decades, , why don't I have close friendships. And why has it always been this way. And that was the moment everything started to change. The path was changed and I changed what I believed I was doing to myself. Not just, , be confident, but to be able to do my job , get in support of people and find some help.

I could be alienating with my sense of humor, and it would come off as insensitive. Sometimes I either said nothing to compensate for this. I would just be really quiet or I would say too much. Three is I lacked social attunement, and I just I missed cues. I didn't always pick up on what people needed. Sometimes I talked over people or I gave advice when all they needed was to be heard. Then number four, I couldn't trust my perception. I was either hyper vigilant and seeing rejection where there wasn't any, or I was completely blind to red flags.

Some things happen quick. Some things take time. It was uncomfortable. Sometimes it was embarrassing, but it worked. It did work. Hey, I've got a quick invite for you.

I stopped disappearing. And when I got scared, I stayed just a little longer each time, just enough to kind of talk things out. Number two was I taught my heart that I belong. Sometimes I just had to tell myself because I didn't naturally believe it. I didn't wait to be invited to things. I would just show up. I participated. I invited other people to do things. They sometimes didn't respond, but I just kept going. I let people see me even when I felt awkward. It was second nature to me. I didn't automatically know how to do it, but I just kept trying. And then it got easier. All. Then I let myself be awkward and I kept going. I gave myself permission to be clunky and weird because I am kind of weird.

I used I always talk about the daily practice, but that's what I did. I use the daily practice techniques because when you start to make big changes in your life and set boundaries and people are mad at you and falling away, you need a way to deal with all the feelings that come up. If you've been living with trauma for a long time, there's a lot of jammed up thoughts and feelings, it's very crowded in there. And when something kind of painful is happening, you made a hard decision and now you feel kind of guilty, you need space to process that and stay real with it and figure out what you need to do about it, if anything. with my daily practice at the time I was making these changes, I had actually quit for two years, I was mad that my marriage fell through. I was scared that I was left with two little kids and not very much work. And I did pull it together. It was. It all worked out just fine. But it was scary then. But I was mad because I guess in my first 12 years of the daily practice, in the back of my mind, I thought it was a magic trick. And if I was good and I did the techniques, I would get everything I wanted. And I thought I wanted the marriage to last. It turns out the marriage ending was one of the best things that ever happened. But it was a very hard road for a couple of years. I didn't see that away. And gradually I realized how bad things got. when I wasn't doing my daily practice for two years, the downfall didn't happen away. It was just this gradual drift. And it took me a long time to go, wait a second. This isn't a coincidence. This isn't all just bad luck that I was losing a lot of my ability. I was losing my red flag detector. I was losing my self confidence. I was losing my energy. I was losing my boundaries. Just problems were just escalating in my life.",

I didn't jump into new things. And I really, really practiced putting my attention on that moment when something triggered me and how I reacted. I practiced.

What was going on. That used to be really uncomfortable for me, which is hard to imagine now. I no longer had to make every situation feel or assume something was wrong just because I was uncomfortable. I just stopped taking crap from people. I just was able to stand up for myself or walk away from situations. And that used to feel rocket science to me. But with a little practice, it started coming naturally.

Betrayal blindness is a survival mechanism for a person who's being mistreated by somebody they must depend upon. But it is a survival mechanism that comes with a big cost.

But this idea of the whoosh, could you talk about that with us. this is something that some people experience more than others.

What we were curious about was who does the Darvoing and can we figure out who's more likely to Darvo. we included some personality scales. One of them was the dark triad scale used to measure. humor. We were able to measure three constellations of sort of personality traits. One is psychopathy.

For the self, you probably have lots of wisdom here, but one of the things we wrote about in Blind to Betrayal was really getting very intentional about relationships and actually taking stock. we're going to be talking about the importance of the self, and we're going to cram that past theck we'll just skip through what we just talked about or a little bit, but I'll mention something here that I use a lot of time and make sure that you don't miss out on when someone says, want to build a relationship with another partner or to choose a partner that you're going with. It's where you weigh as a culture. Basically, what this wifi means is you can count up the data you're intelectually moist and sixteen percent of you lectures are at club skills level. fallows canuel factor in that number. You might be appointed a reunion with a manager, but you believe in all sorts of things. Notice if you feel scared, it's not about fate. It's about how initially this is gonna work. Obviously, that's really important. , and wild cards. when a good relationship security agent wants to know your name, you can ask yourself, , is this what I am experiencing in these relationships.",

And mainly it's old. I buy that. I buy that. It's. what I want to make sense of the present moment and make sense of the present moment and otherwise probably connected to something else. That's pretty. I. , the woman at the coffee shop or whatever. It's not about the coffee shop. Or whatever. I mean, it can be because it can be because we have certain thought patterns. That are fueling it or certain judgments that are fueling it. But those are patterns that are usually built off of old hurts. Yes. They're all defensive. They're all defenses. And it's great. You just said that because when I was doing this resentment work, I remember my sponsor saying behind every resentment is an old wound. really, if you looked at your resentments and of course, most of our resentments are towards our we talk to our caregivers. And when I do. This process with people, I say really you need to be as specific as possible. I have them write out the specific resentment and for some people. I just met with someone recently who says, oh my God, I can't get angry at my mother and her mother's been long gone. But the belief that I can't do that because it and I'm and to work through that to get through this is about freedom. Let's look at the reality. She's not here. This is an old. Feeling state that's causing you anxiety. But really we need to get to the heart and the anger underneath it, which there was a lot of that. let me challenge that for a second. What's the point. What's the point of getting to all this hurt and resentment. , let's take you had 457 resentments or that lady who has an actual baby number three that baby is in her life and it's not going anywhere. Now. She knows I'm actually really angry that I had this baby. How what does that do anyone any good. what do you do with that.",

The second part of that process. Is how is that resentment affecting my life. the second part of that process was there was a list. We were given self-esteem personal relations. My sex life, my sense of security in the world, my sense of security emotionally ambitions in the world. we looked at this list and people can think of other ways that affects them. But basically what we did is first step acknowledging the anger and the resentment. But then we looked at the second part of that process. Acknowledging the anger and the resentment. Second step was how is this affecting me. Because I think you're going to change something unless you really can identify that it's affecting your life. And to me, Emma, the most important thing is our relationships. That's where all this unconscious resentment comes out. second piece, where is this affecting my life. Now, that is a very significant statement. Because when I saw this. I'm thinking of myself. Just think about this for a second. 486 resentments affecting each one affecting how I feel about myself. that to me was mind blowing. Now, the most important part of this exercise is this. We do what's called the turner room. Where the sentence is, we put the person in the category of the spirit of the person. We're in the category of the spiritually sick and we turn it to our own resentment. And we'll take a look at what is affecting me. What am I responsible for. What am I still carrying. Putting them out of our minds. Meaning I can't control what they're going to do. I can't control the past. I can't control that my dad did this to me. I can't control what my mom did this to me. But my inventory and my responsibility is. And my responsibility is, what can I do now. How can I look at this to really see that it's really affecting my life.",

But really, could she be any way other than that. No. the resentment is my responsibility. I have to accept this is what she was capable of being.

I'm not lovable. You try to focus on yourself. Not the other person. I'm not lovable. , I can't trust people, whatever. And then the other cognitive piece is, what's the truth. What's the real truth.

And what you do is you write the anger letter towards the person and then you say what you're sad about.

Yes. Clarity is key. And you just said it. The thing with it is there's often angry people or anxious people, it's all externally focused. they're doing this to me.

I mean, I didn't even tell her when I was paying. , , the only time when they asked you if everything was alright. , you probably didn't feel it because you didn't say anything before. And mentioning it now would seem rather stupid, wouldn't it. without you acting all weird. What is your problem. Why do you put it on me. Do you think you're a good person. Careful. You're such a crazy woman. Maybe I should part with you. Alright. Am Iially sleeping with you. Am Iially sleeping with you. Am Iially sleeping with you.

    "text": "Donnelly Snipes in this video we'll explore the symptoms of codependency discuss how they make sense in context what their function actually is and identify at least one strategy to address each symptom let's start out with one of the most basic low self-worth a lot of people with codependency blame themselves for everything that's gone on in their life and they have a lot of guilt and shame as a result now this may have developed because as a child they were blamed or guilted for everything that happened or may have happened because as a child they thought they had more control than they did they took responsibility for things that were not their fault but they didn't have a caregiver to help them understand the faulty logic that they were using as adults it's important for people who have codependent traits to start developing their self-worth start separating the things they can control from the things they can't control start evaluating the things for which they still carry with them guilt and shame looking at those things and saying how do I actually feel about this now was it my fault was there anything I could have done how can I forgive myself and learn from it I don't do it again and move forward instead of continuing to keep my energy tied up in guilt and shame likewise in the present when they feel the need to blame themselves when something goes wrong and they go to that automatic reaction of it's my fault how can they become more aware of that automatic reaction that automatic self-blame and stop evaluate the facts figure out what they actually have control over and then make decisions from there about what blame they may or may not have in a particular situation the next characteristic is what we call an unstable sense of self and that is one of those sort of amorphous terms that I think is important that we define when people have a stable sense of self they know who they are they know what they are in touch with themselves they know their thoughts wants and needs pretty much in the moment now not everybody is completely connected to themselves but if they stop they can look inside and go this is something that I this is something that I value a person with codependency often does not have that they look for happiness outside of themselves because they don't know what they can't look for happiness inside themselves they just have no clue and they are afraid of abandonment they are afraid of being alone that they are trying to connect with people in a way that makes them happy they are only happy if they are making other people happy they are unaware or repressing their authentic selves they've often been taught if they grew up in an addicted house household or they lived in an addicted household as an adult for a while they may have been taught not to talk not to trust not to feel not to think they quit checking in with themselves they don't know who they are anymore or what they want they've abandoned themselves in order to try to be whatever this other person wants in order to try to be the chameleon they've abandoned themselves and they've repressed that because ultimately their fear of abandonment is strong that it's more important to make sure that somebody else doesn't leave them than to make sure they don't abandon themselves and they feel empty or worthless when they're not engaged in a crisis most of the time people who grew up in codependent households there was constantly a crisis there was constantly something going on that is the norm for the person with codependency when they are not in the midst of a crisis there are two things that happen number one the anxiety goes way up because they start waiting for the other shoe to drop but number two when they're not focused on a crisis and they start sitting with themselves and being with themselves for a minute they start recognizing that they don't know who they are or what they if they are not something for somebody to address the unstable sense of self it's going to be important for the person who is codependent to start becoming more mindful of their thoughts wants needs things they enjoy it's going to be important for them to reconnect with their themselves on an emotional and cognitive level as a physical level noticing remember not all memories are in the form of pictures or words but noticing some of those sensations and trying to figure out I am feeling anxious now I'm feeling a gnawing in the pit of my tummy what does that mean as they become more connected with themselves they will start getting a more stable sense of self however in order to connect with that sense of self it's going to be really important for the person with codependency to have a safe connection with someone else who's there and a lot of times this is the therapist who's there saying you are awesome for who you are tell me who you are I can learn about you because I'm curious and I'm not going to reject you based on your thoughts wants and needs because they're yours I may not agree with every single one of them but I am going to accept you as a person and not reject you as a person and that's really important in order to get over that self-abandonment in order to it's important for people to feel they're going to be abandoned by the other important person in their life which takes us to abandonment fears when people grow up in a chaotic household they can't count on their caregivers to be there to meet their needs they can't count on their caregivers to be there emotionally and sometimes physically and I say a chaotic household I didn't say addicted household why because this can be true in a household where the caregivers have a mental illness or where there's domestic violence it's important to recognize that when people or children are growing up in a chaotic household they don't feel safe and a lot of times in these households they don't receive comfort they don't receive love proactive love they are just the only time they receive attention is when there's a problem they don't learn that they are lovable for who they are and they fear rejection therefore as adults they grow up centering their lives around others if I do what these people want me to do then they won't leave me if I do everything then I can control the situation and I can keep people from leaving me instead of being able to say I'm awesome and I'm going to be me and the people who that will stick around but I'm not everybody's cup of tea and that is way down the line in the recovery process because that's hard for a lot of people to say let alone somebody who is terrified of abandonment and people with codependency are very often terrified of anger in other people because they grew up in a household where sporadically without warning would be the target of a caregiver's anger or rage they would be observing a caregiver's anger or rage at another caregiver they saw anger as a threat instead of anger as a emotional response that tells you hey you might want to check and see if there's a threat anger itself became the threat and when people get angry that's terrifying as an adult or an older adolescent who's recovering from codependency issues it's important to develop an awareness of what anger is why people feel anger and the ability to assess in the present context whether they are actually safe a lot of times people who grew up in dangerous household or households where there was a lot of anger when someone gets angry in the present they flash back to the past it's really important for them to be able to learn how to stop and say am I feeling scared because of what's going on now or is this triggering memories from the past and then developing tools to deal with that people who have codependency issues often are impulsive caretakers and controllers and the three C's can be really challenging because the person with codependency feels if they put themselves in a position where they're indispensable they are caretaking for this person they're doing things for this person that the person can't do for themselves or they don't think the person can do for themselves and if they control every single string on that marionette then that person won't leave and bad things won't happen and this is a very immature type of reasoning the child developed this type of reasoning and they said if I do A B C and D then things are going to be and they learn from a very early age there was sort of a recipe for trying to make sure that the dysfunctional other in the family did not become angry did not abandon them they may not have specifically figured it out on their own the enabler in the family the other caregiver for example may have taught them you when your sign when your other person is around when the dysfunctional other is around these are the things you can do these are the things that you can't do and these are the eggshells that we have to walk on they started figuring out we have to maintain rigid control there are rules and that keeps us safe in adulthood the person in recovery needs to evaluate every time they start trying to control something number one is it something that even needs to be controlled number two is it something that is their to control you can control your own feelings you can control your own responses you can control your own thoughts you can't control other people you can control the environment but is it your place to try to control everything in the environment or is it everybody's responsibility and this is a huge learning curve for a lot of people with neurodependency to be able to unhook from the dysfunctional other unhook from their significant other and say this is me these are my thoughts feelings wants needs and responsibilities and these are yours and you need to do what you can do for you and that I'll be there to support you as long as you're doing it but I'm not going to do it for you I'll give you an example in recovery in counseling a lot of times I work with people who need what we call wrap around services they need to connect with Snap or they need to connect with Medicaid or something that and that can be kind of overwhelming when you haven't done that before these systems can get really cumbersome to deal with sometimes I'll have people make those calls or do their first connections in my office I'm not going to do it for them I am not going to call and make the appointment for them they can make an appointment themselves they're adults but I will be there for emotional and moral support if for some reason they had a problem I'm there but when they do it and they succeed then they realize hey I can do it myself and a codependent response would be to do it for them to make the appointment for them to make to drive them to their appointment to do all of these things a healthy response is to say this is something you can do I'll cheer you on but I'm not going to do it for you I will allow you to experience your own successes and use your own strengths people who are codependent live in extremes they are either extremely in control or extremely out of control when things start to go out of control sometimes they're just fine I give up and then they withdraw they're extremely responsible or when they start getting overwhelmed and exhausted they may become extremely irresponsible and they may go from love to hate they love this person with all of their heart and then the person does something that they don't and then they hate the person and they're angry at them but they do the same thing for themselves they may go maybe not love but they can deal with being in their own skin to hating themselves and being filled with guilt and shame and remorse they may have obsessive anxiety about what will happen next when they grew up in this chaotic household they couldn't anticipate especially as a child they couldn't anticipate the fact that they were in this chaotic household they couldn't anticipate especially as a child they couldn't anticipate especially as a child they couldn't anticipate what was going to happen and as adults they still hang on to that because they are expecting what has always been to continue to be they're expecting people to be unpredictable they're expecting people to be untrustworthy they're hyper vigilant trying to catch people doing wrong and you may be scratching your head going what sense does that make if you catch somebody before they fall completely then you keep them from hurting themselves your child's learning to walk and they start to wobble and you catch them you keep them from falling on their bum somebody's in recovery and they start to get weak or wobbly in their recovery and you catch them then there may not completely relapse however if you keep catching them they're never going to learn how to study themselves if you keep catching the child and not letting them fall not far but just on their bum then they don't learn how to balance themselves they don't learn how to walk effectively as adults or people in recovery the person needs to become aware of when they're being hypervigilant when they're being overly suspicious or helicoptering or whatever word that they want to use and start recognizing the importance of letting people walk on their own and if they end up falling we can deal with that but it's important to allow people to take responsibility for their own behaviors and not spend much time looking for them to do wrong because when you're looking for them to do wrong you're going to find wrong even if it's not there you're going to start seeing hints and glimpses and assuming when things might be completely benign people with codependency have difficulty identifying and modulating their own emotions which often ends up resulting in inappropriate intense anger either at other people or themselves the stress tolerance skills are essential here as developing emotional intelligence the ability to identify their feelings early warning signs of their feelings triggers for their feelings and ways to modulate their feelings is really important they didn't develop that as children need a secure attachment they need a caregiver to help them learn how to identify their emotions and figure out what do I do with this a lot of people with codependency never had that it's important for them to work on developing their emotional intelligence they often have communication difficulties because they grew up in a house where communication was crappy they may exhibit multiple communication patterns being aggressive when they feel things are starting to get out of control they may be blamed threatened or guilt in order to try to bring people back into the fold in order to try to control them they may be passive aggressive where they say that's fine whatever do what you want even though it's going to break my heart or they may be completely passive they may just say I will do whatever you want me to do even if I hate it and it's important to examine what these are basically in every situation it means I'm going to do whatever I can do in order to try to prevent you from abandoning me if I can blame threaten guilt manipulate and suck you back in then I'm going to do that because that helps me feel safe if I need to be passive aggressive which again is going to use guilt to kind of bring you back in because there's that aggressive point and that's what I'm going to do or if I need to conform then guess what that may be what I'm going to do people with codependency go back and going back to communication difficulties it's important for people in recovery to start paying attention to their communication styles to learn how to communicate assertively where they say these are my thoughts and wants and needs and they are just as important as your thoughts wants and needs this is what I would to see from you guys thank you much for joining us today I'm going to see you see happen what would you to see happen instead of telling people what needs to happen all the time getting input tell me what your thoughts wants and needs are at this moment paying attention to when they communicate aggressively and use some of these behaviors and exploring how they learned that growing up maybe that's how their caregivers communicated with each other or with them what would you rather do to solve the situation what is your hope for outcome and what would be a healthier more productive way of achieving it poor boundaries poor personal boundaries for the person who's codependent and this is another one where they are in extremes they can be extremely rigid in their boundaries this is the way things have to go my thoughts are going to hold steady and I'm actually going to ignore your boundaries and push on through and assert my boundaries over yours but their personal boundaries can also be very weak when their significant others or the dysfunctional others are sad they take on that feeling of sadness when their significant others are scared they that feeling of fear and they try to fix it's important to recognize that boundaries are on roller skates in people with codependency when it's helpful for the boundaries to be rigid when it protects them they may keep them up but a lot of times their boundaries are overpowering other people and not respecting others it will be important for people to start becoming aware of what boundaries are and i have a video about that if you are not aware and to try to start evaluating how weak or how strong are their boundaries with different people because your boundaries differ with different people and cognitively or perceptually people with codependency often have a lot of what we call cognitive distortions this is not uncommon because people who experienced a chaotic household growing up formed their schema based on early childhood thought processes which are concrete based they make their decisions based on what they can see hear and feel in the moment they can't extrapolate what else might have happened or what could happen next week what they see hear and feel in the moment they think dichotomously it's all good or all bad and they think very personally children think they have a lot more control than they actually do they take responsibility for things the person with codependency often thinks in all or nothing terms you are either you either love me or you hate me you're either doing everything or you're a screw up it's important to help them start looking at exceptions and they feel the same way about themselves they feel they're good some days or they're complete screw-ups other days and they hold on to those mistakes and they dwell on those and they have a lot of they have a lot of difficulty letting go of mistakes personalization everything's about them you did this because you don't care about me you did this because you hate me you did this because of me and it's important for the person with codependency to evaluate other alternatives maybe they did it because they were in pain maybe they did it because they weren't thinking it didn't have anything to do with you it was them being insensitive what are the other alternatives for why this might have happened besides you why is it could it be what are some other explanations besides it being your fault mind reading growing up in a chaotic household the child learned that it was important to anticipate their caregivers every thought want and need in order to prevent that anger they carried that into adulthood that is a default way of responding for them and it's important to encourage them to explore and to communicate more effectively with the people in their lives they're not assuming that they know what other people are thinking feeling wanting or needing jumping to conclusions without evidence it's important to help them get the facts about what's going on magnification is another cognitive distortion and again this is another fact-based error it's important to have that in order to be able to communicate more effectively acceptance of self- with some of these identity prileistictier identity trim Santi acids of Yours isowing awareness after enormous Alert to wrong crochet

that way you can recognize them in yourself and go what and say to yourself what i'm pretty awesome i'd to be my friend because that's what validation is it's being your own best friend and you may not validate yourself if you were taught that we are that you are only lovable if somebody else says you are and again that goes back to relying on other people to get their head out of their own

information easy tips for how to leverage sharing sticks timings forums community tools the videos content search and fewer results easy direction but better guess what works for you how to grab your model team first focus on how to get your social relationships and validation and everything we need to recognize that letting go and forgiveness can be very scary and if we rely on that other person to validate us then letting go can be terrifying because if I let go of that person who validates me then who's going to do it maybe I'll have a place to be we want to be able to recognize that it's important to be able to validate ourselves that if somebody leaves our life we don't feel we're going to disappear forgiveness can be scary because it means letting go of anger it means letting go of hostility it doesn't mean forgetting and forgiveness is really a power play letting go means choosing not to waste your energy fighting against something you can't control or is not worth your energy again going back to a bad relationship for example if you're in a bad relationship and that person is not validating you that person is not making you feel your uber self they're dragging you down in some way shape or form and it's just it's oil and water it may not be the best relationship to stay in but letting go is hard number one because what to expect with that person and you don't know when you're going to find somebody else and dating is a hassle and all that but letting go is a choice you make in order to be true to yourself inside your own your own head your brain and your heart are telling you this is a bad thing this is not where you need to be this is not a good situation for you when you say it yourself and you say you're this is not a good situation for me I need to get out oh my gosh how liberating is that but then that means you've got to let go that means you've got to let that person go to the curb and be with that and choose not to waste your energy fighting against trying to change them not waste your energy trying to make them into something they're not we cannot change other people we can help them see things we can suggest that we would to see some changes but unless they want to make those changes they ain't going to make them we can't change other people when we let go we're saying what I'm done I tried as hard as I can and it's time for me to move on because if I validate my own thoughts and my own feelings I know that the move for me is to move on forgiveness means letting go of the hurt and resentment that's draining your energy you can move forward to what's important to you forgiveness is for you not them if you're in a relationship that's not meeting your needs and you're frustrated with that person because you feel they're just they're not trying you feel they're undermining you feel they're not validating you whatever it is you can get really frustrated at you're not doing this you're not done you're done iPad open the door there's no time to dropped are up let go ahead let's get together okay30 are resist all you're not done you're done the doing this they're not what are you doing what do you need to do forgiveness is accepting that they either made a mistake or they did something that was unacceptable and you identified it or they're not willing to change and you need to be willing to forgive them because that unleashes that energy if you stay angry at them for not changing then when you get into your next relationship you're still carrying that baggage with you and you're probably still back in the back of your mind looking for this next person to do the same thing and the next person after that forgive that person what you had you were too stuck in your own stuff I'm not going to forget I'm not going to go back there but I'm going to forgive you because it's not worth it I'm not going to go back there but I'm going to forgive you because it's not worth it worth me staying angry over what you did or didn't do for me and I'm going to move forward letting go and forgiveness are things that we generally can only do when we start validating ourselves can you get validation and have control at the same time not everybody's going to validate you it's it's not their job to make you feel your job is to make you feel but there's generally you generally will always have some people that you will that will validate you whether it's your parents or your best friend or whomever you're generally going to have someone that will validate you if you get hung up on why a particular person won't validate you ask yourself why do I care if this particular person is just not getting with your program why are you why are you beating your head against a wall for that why do you keep going after something that isn't clearly not going to resolve the way you want a lot of times this is because you're trying to relive something from the past and you're trying to quote get it this time if you've been in a bad relationship and you get into another relationship that's similar you may be trying to make this one work out correctly a lot of times people will redo things subconsciously trying to succeed trying to fix it this time another question you can ask yourself is why am I trying to control this person why is it worth my energy to try to convince them to do all the things that I want the way I want why do I need to do that there are millions of other people out there what is it about this person and what parts of this situation do I have control over because maybe the person's not doing what you wanted them to do because you haven't clearly communicated all that you have control over maybe the person isn't doing what you want them to do because they don't want to you don't have control over that then you can the part you have control over is whether you choose to stay in that relationship and stay in that situation if it is not growth producing if it is hurting you instead of enhancing you when you're in relationships when things happen and you're feeling you need validation and people aren't doing what you want it can be a really icky place to be practice psychological flexibility identify to yourself that you're feeling empty you're feeling unloved you're feeling however you're feeling and then ask yourself what things can I do starting know to improve the next moment what would make me happy what things can I do what do I have control over can you get enough sleep can you go out and exercise can you hang out with some different friends what is it that you can do to improve your next moment instead of staying stuck spinning your wheels it's a car stuck in the mud and you're just spinning your wheels and throwing mud and digging deeper into it if you try to fight this other situation try to fight and get somebody to do something that they are just not going to do and develop hardiness commitment control and challenge and we're going to focus mainly on commitment remember every single morning when you wake up and every night before you go to bed kind of do an inventory of all the awesome things in your life what's going for you what good things do you have in your life you're gonna have some things that are not going the best nobody has a perfect life all the time that's but too often we get stuck focusing on those things that aren't going the best and then we start feeling unlovable and unsuccessful and un everything it's important to remember all of it's important to remember all of it's important to remember all of it's important to remember all of the things that you've got going for you the friends that you have the things that are going in your life and that will help you keep moving forward and remember commitment be committed to those values that make you such a lovable awesome person because if you're exuding awesomeness other people are going to gravitate towards you if you are kind and compassionate and caring and intelligent and whatever the things are that make you who you are other people who value those qualities are going to gravitate towards you it's just a matter of taking a breath and living authentically other things that you can do with psychological flexibility you can unhook from your thoughts ending relationships and not going back can be really challenging especially if you have low self-esteem or codependency there are a lot of reasons one of the things to do when you get out of a relationship and you're tempted to try to go back and make up you're tempted to minimize what was going on and get back into the relationship a lot of times your brain is saying i can't live without that person and you may feel in your heart a part of it's being ripped out and it kind of is and you feel you can't take it unhooking from your thoughts is a way of separating from that and instead of saying i can't take it say i'm having the thought that i can't take it i'm having the thought that i'm going to be alone forever and then work through it because thoughts come and go let that thought go or replace it with another more accurate thought identify who and what is truly important in your life and acknowledge your feelings thoughts urges and behaviors in the present if you're feeling lonely and isolated and defeated that's acknowledge it instead of fighting with it or ignoring it acknowledge it and then say what can i do to improve the next moment you can make two lists the first list is things that i do or think that help me move toward the important things in my life and review this list every day because these are things that you want to do to keep moving forward and the other list is things that i do or think that keep me stuck drain my forward energy or move me away from what is important and dwelling on things chasing after old loves there's a lot of things we do that waste our energy that could be used to move towards our goals you have those two lists review the positive list every day that'll help you remember what you need to do to keep moving toward the important things take care of your health if you want to be there for your kids because they're important one of those ways to do that is to take care of your health your live a long life and finally make a choice remember that when you feel a certain way you have control over how to use your energy you can either spend the energy running after that person pleading with them to change and to take you back and to do all these things and probably not get anywhere and be back in the same place in a month or you can choose to do something different and live more authentically moving towards other people and things that are important in your life and acknowledge that one while it had its benefits also had a lot of drawbacks and for your own health sanity and happiness you need to let it go steps towards self-validation here are some exercises you can do identify the values and characteristics about yourself that make you awesome we talked about that one make a bill of and each item starts with item start with item pick and that's your what's your name what's your name you can't pick and deserve to i deserve to be happy i deserve to take a break i deserve to whatever keep that bill of going try to make 20 items that's going to make you really think by the time you get past 10 you really start having to think about what exactly do i deserve and if you can't think of all of them think about your kids for example and think about what do they deserve what do your kids deserve they deserve to be happy they deserve to be healthy they deserve to not be scared what else follow your bill of once you write it you got to follow it remind yourself when you start doing things am i adhering to my own bill of identify the people in your past from whom you craved validation and never got it and explore why that may have been more about them than about you if you wanted validation from one of your parents and you just could never seem to please that parent now that you're older and wiser and everything else let's look back and see if that was more about them and their frustrations or their stuff than it was about you or maybe they actually did approve of you but they didn't know how to communicate it you didn't feel valid even though they approved of you identify why you crave validation do you want to know that you're important and a lot of times if you're not able to self-validate then you need others to tell you're and you're important if you can validate yourself then you don't crave validation from others make a list of people who fit the label that the person that you want to be who is it that is important relevant and lovable in your life and identify how you're those people if you have a hard time identifying what's awesome about you look around at your friends and the people that you value and identify what's awesome about them and then go do i have that quality and a lot of times you're going to find that you do have that quality or something similar we've gone over kind of a broad spectrum and we're talking a lot about validation because the need for validation from other people is one of the reasons that many people stay in unhealthy relationships we talked about why we may need validation how we can get validation how we can validate ourselves and then we talked a little bit about letting go of control and admitting that sometimes somebody else just can't or won't validate us but a lot of times that's because of their stuff and we can't fix that they have to be willing to fix that we've got to be able to let go of control forgive them for not being willing to play by our playbook and move on and then we ended with exploring some psychological flexibility activities that we can do and we've been able to do that for a long time and i think that's a great way to start i think in order to learn about and keep present in our mind how awesome we are and why we deserve love and respect if you this podcast please subscribe on your favorite podcast app join our facebook group at docsnipes.",

By the same token, they need to feel they're in control of that person because they don't want that person to leave. More time than anticipated is spent thinking about engaging in or recovering, in this case, from the relationship. , in codependency, many times the relationship is with someone who needs help, who is struggling with their own depression, addiction, something else. And as a result, the person with codependency is constantly being called upon to do things. They are constantly worried about if they're in a relationship with a person with an addiction, is Jim Bob going to relapse. Is this going to happen. Are they going to be home safe. they're constantly thinking about that other person and wondering if they're going to be able to do things. And they're also spending a lot of time covering up for when that person doesn't do the thing, covering up for it and making excuses for it. And then recovering from the shame, from the anger that the person didn't behave, from the exhaustion, from constantly wondering, constantly worrying, and constantly covering up and trying to fix things. As a result of all of this, you can imagine it's time consuming. significant events and activities are given up or minimized, and there's often a failure to fulfill other major role obligations because the person with codependency is focused on this relationship that they can't focus at work. They can't focus on their hobbies. They can't focus maybe even on their kids because they are concerned about this and consumed with this other relationship and terrified of losing it. Back to insecure attachment. We have this child who can't exist on their own. They're six months, five years, even 10 years old. They can't exist on their own. They're dependent on their caregivers who are not consistently there and responsive for them. they feel terrified. And then they finally get into a place where they think, , , this person might stick around and be attentive. I need to make sure that they stick around and I need to invest all my energy because maybe if I work a little bit harder, then this person won't leave me. Think about it.",

Why. , that's because narcissists sense when you're waking up. They can feel that shift in your tone, your confidence, your boundaries, your energy, and it terrifies them. Now, here's what most people don't realize. They don't realize. They don't realize. They don't see themselves as narcissists. And you can drive yourself crazy going, oh, do they realize it. Oh, do they know. As if them actually knowing gives them a little bit of a pass. I'm not sure. But, no. They actually don't see themselves as narcissists. Now, of course, maybe some of the grandiose ones who recognize some of the characteristics and they just don't care. But I would say, for the most part, most of the people that you're struggling with are covert narcissists. And, no, they don't see themselves as narcissists. They don't see themselves as the problem. Manipulative people don't see themselves as manipulative. They actually just see themselves as getting what it is that they need and they feel entitled to get it from you however they need to. And, yes, they truly do believe you are the problem. Their patterns are ingrained that they literally can't process your awakening without getting escalated. Because their goal has always been the same and it always will be the same is getting what they want. And they're going to use whatever tactic they could possibly come up with. , now, they're scrambling because they know. They know you're onto them. , before we talk about what tricks they're going to pull, what I'd to do is to let's dive into three clear signs. One. That they know you're onto them. Sign number one. You told them. Yes, I mean, it's this. I'm onto you. I'm not taking your nonsense anymore. I know you're a narcissist. You're this. You're that. And you call them out. And, look, I get it. It feels really good. And you likely won't admit it. But you need them to know that they can't push you around any longer. And while this feels empowering, in just a few minutes, I'm going to share with you how and why this is likely to backfire.",

He's going to walk through it, but he's not going to do it for you. I had somebody ask me years ago, can't God just take away all of my bad memories and can't God just make me think differently. , yes, but no, he's not going to do it. That would make you a robot.

Please be prayerful. Very, very prayerful. And of course, set your boundaries. I think after living years of marriage and not setting boundaries, how to effectively communicate boundaries. If you're dealing with the Darvo method, how to stop second guessing myself. for those of you who are not familiar, Darvo stands for deny, attack, reverse victim offender. a lot of times when you try to communicate something to the narcissist, they deny it away.

How do you not trigger reactions and your beliefs, feeling you're gonna be fired when you're still actually employed and valued. How do you reclaim perception of yourself and others. And that word perception is a key to this video, hold on to it. Let's pause here and summarize what we just discussed. Here is what we've established. One, sometimes we get caught up in the diagnosis and the traits of a narcissistic parent too much. Focusing on the damage and the impact is actually the way out of the damage. And a damage doesn't always mean broken. In other words, think of your triggers are the healing path onto something new, not just focusing on the abusive parents' crappy behaviors. And I'd love to hear from you now about how any of those things apply to you. Leave a comment if you ever wondered what not living in fear of what other people think of you might actually look. Remember, damage doesn't mean broken. What would it feel if you trusted yourself in assessing who people really are and trusting yourself about who you are in that. And most importantly, what would it be if we weren't hypervigilant about what people thought about us related to that parent. Those questions I just asked you all involve perception. Here is the impact on a child's perception of having a parent that. And I often say the deepest wound of childhood trauma is the damage done to a child. And I often say the deepest wound of childhood trauma is the damage done to a child. And I often say the deepest wound of childhood trauma is the damage done to a child. And others. Here are three simple categories to explore the damage to our perception. And again, think of how you see yourself and how you see others.

Don't just put it off. I really want you to kind of try this out. Imagine through writing your statement that you're telling your narcissistic parent the truth about that situation they put you in, the truth about who you were, who you were in it, and most importantly what them to be now. just someone who is just sad and kind of broken because that's different than our perception of them then. they had all the power. that mother with the Christmas example had all the power to just shoot through her daughter or her son and just say that they were a bad kid when that wasn't true. Or that they were a bad kid when they were a kid. What comes up about maybe doing that statement. Perhaps the most important piece of this video about moving on from a narcissistic parent's legacy is don't get caught up in your head to tell me that the truth is subjective depending on who's talking. And what I mean by that is that is your inner child speaking from a lifetime of having your heart broken and being taught about yourself. That the truth kind of doesn't matter when that's not true. Abuse is not subjective. Facts are not true. You don't need to play devil's advocate with yourself for your abusers sake or people who weren't there or people who didn't care the potatoes that I mentioned. Really in this truth statement is you are dismantling their narrative and just simply telling the truth. now let's move on to the third one, the final one, which is my favorite. The giving back game. We're going to take back our power with a simple exercise I call the give it back game.

We've worked on the clarity about the damage. We've learned that the diagnosis about the parent isn't as important. We've learned about damage to our perception, our thought and our own stories, how it plays out, in that example with my narcissistic father. And the exercises were your inner adult stepping in to protect your inner child, your true statement about what happened to your sense of self, and then the giving back game about how to start projecting around intimacy and relating to people differently.

I'm going to talk about some of the things that I learned in the last few days, and then I will talk about some of the things that I have learned, and I will keep working on this. you can see that the narcissistic parent takes time. It takes time in processing the damage to our perception, our sense of self, self-worth and our intimacy issues. You can start with your present stuck places and direct them back to that narcissistic parent. It is very empowering to give the issues back to them. And again, you didn't get to choose them. They were really forced onto you. They're forced onto kids in these families. And I hope the prompts that I've given you today are helpful in getting you to start reclaiming some power and really trying to choose your children back. I think that's where the challenge is. I'm going to go ahead and put this in the chat box. that I've given you today are helpful in getting you to start reclaiming some power and really exploring the ways perception was damaged and how it can actually be healed. This video is actually a shortened video version of a chapter in a workbook that I've written that I mentioned earlier. The chapter is about how to recover from a narcissistic parent.",

I really believe that there's the therapist or the helper out there, and there shouldn't be this many barriers. But look for the people who are able to say, I finally found someone, and we're actually doing some work. I'm actually getting somewhere. Look for those statements from people. Try not to let your inner child go to that place of it's never going to happen for me. You can be frustrated. You can be annoyed. It's annoying. You can be mad, but try not to look at it's confirming something about you. That's the rub here. That's when your inner child is back in an old place where it wasn't worth keep trying, which was definitely true growing up, to get your needs met. But the present is different. When someone asked me about how to find a therapist, my first piece of advice is, try to be as tenacious and persistent, because for every 10 to 15 emails or calls you make, maybe one therapist or helper would get back to you because most of them are full. It's funny, but inner children actually hate that advice, I think, because it takes them back to their family system where nothing worked for them, or it was all on them. It's sort of a feeling of, you're not wrong for feeling this. Why can't this be easy. Again, you're not wrong, but there's a trauma. , I think that's the final response in this. It's only really our inner adult, not the inner child, who can say, this sucks, but F it. I'm going to keep plugging away and finding what I need to get my needs met. Number four is, I've seen the light. You should too. This pitfall is about being moved, motivated, jazzed up about your healing gains, and you're just wanting more connection and more authenticity that you try to get everyone on board the healing train. I know that none of that is super bad or super negative, but we might try to recruit others into healing long before they're ready or long before they want to. I don't know about you, but I dislike being recruited for anything.",

The missing piece in this codependency thing in terms of a healthy development in childhood is that we want our children to be both capable of intimacy, but also be self-sufficient in terms of security and self intimacy. I mentioned, they can self soothe and they can also see their good side. And that's what we're trying to do. we're trying to do inner child work where we are bonding with our inner child who is seeking meet in a Instagram story, analyst or whatever, which that way is going to go. That way we can help them to meet their kinship enfin or we can also help people with emotionally things closer when they're doing the work.

A good example of that inner security is the gradual withdrawal of security blankets or sucking one's thumb, or gradually, in later school years, in sort of, , grammar school years, to not be dysregulated as a child without a beloved stuffed animal. And these security transitional objects are all part of a healthy childhood, but there are often signs of security problems when children age and they cannot let go of those things. They get stuck into a transitioning from childhood to adolescence and on into adulthood.",

Make sure you choose wisely about who you practice taking risks with probably not going to go with really difficult or highly abusive people. obviously another is working with your inner child and helping them with the fear around the risk-taking in addition to working around the issues such as overly apologetic. Or apologizing or getting really upset when you're not feeling validated the risk-taking leads to becoming more emotionally mature and confident about how you communicate and again. This is why group work is always one of my main suggestions as trauma is super relational and I think that the healing needs to be relational as being in a group and communicating is a risk. I've never met someone who is psyched join a group to be honest. neither was I but being in a group and learning how to communicate. And realizing that you're not going to die from taking a risk around safe people is you can't get much better than that in terms of growth again. I haven't met a survivor yet who didn't feel super shaky about their emotional confidence in terms of knowing how much to be upset about something or how to talk about it without being really.

All nuance, but I think you probably understand what I mean. Lastly number nine is I could never do that briefly. I could never do that is a sharp thought or expression when an opportunity comes up to be more visible or take on a challenge or try to finally explore something in you that you're maybe drawn to what I mean is an opportunity comes up at work to present your work in a meeting and there's a intense reaction. I could never do that an opportunity comes up when someone says you'd be good at selling cupcakes that you make or market a service or thing that you do I could never accept money about that accepting money would be wrong. It's wrong, could never do that an opportunity to take a dance class or sing at an open mic your roommate says you have a nice voice and you should perform somewhere and there's oh I could never do that. Even though there might be your dream to do that shame tells us that being visible or wanting a bit of the spotlight is terribly wrong or grandiose. It also convinces us that will make a fool out of ourselves. there's a lot going on with this one. You might also have some grief or jealousy when you see others who can freely take up some of the spotlight without shame in our inner child can be intimidated by such people or feel they're a bit too showboaty. we can also be judgy of those who have some spotlight while we kind of want some of it as. Where it could come from in childhood trauma is being raised in an incredibly shame based family where the thing to do is to let other people shine but wanting that for yourself is selfish and wrong abusive families can even police their children from being too extroverted or wanting to be funny or wanting to be entertaining just normal kids stuff.",

And I think with all of these, getting the doer to dip down into their feelings in psychotherapy or in group work or something that would be a good part of treatment to help them kind of sink down into the feelings or increase their window of tolerance for some feelings. Or even kind of help the doer kind of hit bottom with the doing, talking about it, really kind of making the coping strategy more real to them. Interpersonal groups can help if they are working, if they're a working group, what I call a working group, and get the doer to relate in different ways away from the fixing or the helping or taking over.

    "text": "What I mean by that is a hostile usually deals with their feelings from a hard anger place up front and detaches from childhood grief and sadness about say in any of the examples I gave earlier, not having a family connection with their parents who are really limited in say in a survival mode. The hostile would do in a group, but not in a family. they would be in a group where they do their advice giving or controlling things, even in subtle ways, and are kind of checked and they have to be kind of processed in a good working group or talked about that the other people don't really, they want something else from them. They don't want that general advice. It's also beneficial for the hostile to get validation that they spent their childhood kind of in a rage and frustration. And it was appropriate back then, but not appropriate now. Then some learning would have to take place about accepting people as they are, seeing the humanity in others, know how to be just with somebody instead of, , giving advice or being upset by giving the advice. All that's a big reversal there, letting people be themselves to make their own mistakes and still be loving towards them. Hostiles really struggle with being loving. They might confuse control for love and they lose the humanity in others and can be ruled by confirming those things about people. See, I knew it kind of stuff. Chances are a good therapist would want the hostile to step out of the addiction to anger and upset, the addiction to being kind of self-righteous, which is top tier sign that we're triggered and learn to reclaim some compassion, some self-compassion and love, which was kind of taken away from them or got wrecked. Moving on to number three, something that I'm calling the darkness or what did I do or what's the point. The darkness trauma personality is rooted in the FON response, as a bit of the freeze response. They tend to give off energy that feels hopelessness, kind of lack of power, defeatist, and definitely some negativity. Unlike the doer or the hostile, the darkness often wrestles with making decisions and avoiding out of this kind of analysis paralysis kind of stuff that happens to them. Here are some examples and qualities of the darkness.",

Again, it's not judgmental. Chances are other people in the darkness's life kind of want them for that too. And coming to, isn't this just who I am. Again, the others, this is ingrained in their trauma conditioning given what happened to them. But I don't believe that when they were two, they were really this dark. They weren't, as a two year old, they weren't sort of saying you can't handle me. I'm such a mess. with all of these, I'm not suggesting the authentic personality to be reclaimed is gonna be a total 180, to become a different person. That would be silly. It doesn't mean you're not gonna not dark things or dark themes. It's just, you can do other things too. The darkness is just able to see that things actually do work or that people do want them in their lives and do enjoy them, rather than feel they have to be down in a hole with you or something that. How the darkness can become more real. A goal to be able to be around others or be in intimacy and be free in that and clear from the negativity as the neurotic discomfort. I know that's a huge order, but it takes time over kind of a long process, just with the other personalities. The darkness really needs to deal with the original dark things that happened to them and hopefully get the opportunity to mend that broken heart. They also have to decide if they really value the darkness kind of energy that they give off. They have to learn also how to be with themselves and others without the safety of wanting to point out how bad things are or how negative things are gonna be. And don't take this as, I hate this stuff. Just go be positive. That's kind of obnoxious, doesn't really work. But again, processing how the heart got broken with a capable healer, noticing how the present is different is gonna be helpful depending on the resources that are available to you.",

That's the first place, but I know that finding someone that is super hard, much less affording them. when I start with clients, I have them do a genogram with me. I have an e-course that walks you through how to put a genogram together. In addition, there are three other e-courses on my website that are helpful in processing childhood or the family system, including a talk I did on shame that includes a worksheet on how to do the inner child dialoguing.

One is that you can actually step out of the toxic chase or reactivity dynamics with men or the masculine in general. If you can figure out that inner child peace and the unfinished business with your own father you can be able to step out of this stuff and catch it. Next is you can actually trust yourself and identify toxic behaviors and patterns and the legacy that your father kind of left that you were left holding this bag of just stuff. The more you focus on your father you can spot these things more as how you project in that projection and replication. The more you focus on your father you can spot these things more as how you project in that projection and replication.

And you're oh my gosh I'm sorry I didn't work getting all that attention can really make us feel freaked out. I mean it's I don't think it's ever comfortable I think if you're super comfortable. It's a little bit weird. Maybe it's cool if you're three or four years old or if you're five but it's always just oh God please finish a song.

That's another example of being on the spot. Where this might come from in childhood trauma. This amazing psychologist named Irving Yalom talks to these psychiatrists I believe actually talks about how we only usually experientially talk to a child in this way. Look at me when I'm talking to you. Look at me when I'm talking to you. We only tend to do that if we're abusive and we only tend to do that to children. That's an extreme version of when we're on the spot. And many of you may have really grown up with that finger in your face. What did you do. But I would that aggression. Hyper abusive hypercritical. That's a big example of where this stuff might come from. It might come from not having a safe person in early life where when you think about being securely attached and children needing a lot of help you're in daycare and there's a play date and you're just dropped off instead of having a safe person that you can help with all that focus. With all that newness I hopefully I'm making sense here but children need a lot of hand holding in that way.",

Find some supportive people where you can practice discussing your emotions in real time and learn how to actually feel the anger or feel the grief instead of just kind of making fun of how bad it was. Moving on to number eight, which is something that I'm simply calling crying valve. Crying valve is, this one is pretty simple. Either you can't cry or you can't stop crying. You can often think about childhood trauma on a spectrum. I do this with many of these concepts where the goal is somewhat heading towards the middle, where the goal is somewhat heading towards the middle, where the goal is somewhat heading towards the middle, and to become more balanced in these things. Extreme left on the spectrum, whichever your left or is, extreme left on the spectrum is being shut down and they can't access grief. And extreme is the emotional eruption, think volcano of hopelessness and overwhelm, which isn't exactly processing grief either. Examples, going into therapy and feeling really on the spot and not knowing what to do about the grief because that feeling is missing. It's missing from your insides. Same with the possible big situations a wake or a funeral and you're not feeling anything. You're not a sociopath, it's just a symptom of trauma. Going to therapy, now the other side of this is going to therapy and you can't stop crying in front of the therapist and you can't get, kind of get it together to have the discussion or you can't regulate. I'm not criticizing you. These are just common childhood trauma symptoms. Where this might come from, every child has their own strategy growing up in childhood. Some really leave their emotional body in an extreme way and shut down to the numbness, which is a really good strategy. And some kids go to a survival strategy of cry for help. They, and they kind of can live in that in adulthood. The adult who is overwhelmed with crying, the upset might be about crying for help more than it is about the feelings underneath. it's a little bit complicated. It's almost there's the grief down here, but then there's the cry for help. And that's the cry for help strategy, I think up here.",

I hope it was just very helpful about that definition. Think stuckness. have you ever played these kind of waiting games with yourself. even things , I'm going to get going in my day after I get some energy and then you end up just doom scrolling until it hits kind of critical mass. Those are terrible, awful stuck places that feel impossible to get some movement on. I've been there. And this is in the overlap with ADHD and it should be noted to that. But this is really the childhood trauma part that I'm discussing that could lead to struggling with waiting games. Where it comes from. Having parents who lived in this most of their lives, they were very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, my parent, my mother specifically lived in this kind of, I will do X after Y when things get better. Could simply come from not being parented. a child doesn't do their homework and it's 11 PM and they're tired. They're going to go to bed and they think, I know I'll get up early and do my homework then. But they don't operate on an alarm clock kind of a thing. That kind of level of neglect and not being parented can give us these magical thinking, which is what waiting games kind of are. Experiencing emotional abuse in childhood where you're taught that, you're not good at getting anything done. Or you believe that because you're neglected and you're overwhelmed. Or you're emotionally shamed for being an F up child. Or you're hearing things , who do you think you are that you can make those band tryouts kind of stuff. all that garbage is essentially being shot down before you even start. we play these games about, because we don't have enough gas in the tank because of all that emotional abuse. some treatment ideas. Being more and more aware of how your inner child believes that change only comes from being in the mood or having the energy at the time, which is false.",

    "text": "And often a toxic family demands enmeshment, where we have some goodness, kind of, in such a family, only if we are selfless. Or if we only just go along. Or if we take what they say about us or say to us. And not rock boats or be different or be an individual. Think about that if that resonates when you think about your family system in terms of goodness and enmeshment. I look at a healthy sense of self as a deep automatic assumption that not only do we exist, but we have a to the seat at the table at the human collective because we automatically know that there is a good enough and our goodness in place. shame tells us that we do not have a seat at the table and it tells us that we're bad for wanting a seat at the table. Having a strong sense of self is the opposite of when we automatically make ourselves small in various situations because there is an internal valuing of ourselves and our security. My definition of self is rooted in personal power and goodness. And goodness and power are the missing ingredients that we want kids to have when they're going through development. It sure makes life a hell of a lot easier if we feel we're a good person doing good things and we have some agency in life. what does a healthy sense of self look. Here is what I mean. A big thing I think is the ability to include oneself socially in the form of belonging that can also kind of involve self advocacy. We can include ourselves in conversation and also take some risks without the intense fear of being ostracized or self-sabotaging or something that. Sense of self is actually a pretty action oriented thing. Another thing is the ability to disagree with somebody without messy internal complications. This is again, we're talking about a healthy sense of self. Another is knowing who we are in a good enough way. Not too big, not too small. Another one we have a good solid sense of self is we have the ability to not absorb feedback from other people or get super defensive or confused by other people feedback. Another is the ability to stick to one's choices and convictions.",

It sounds goofy but it's a John Bradshaw idea where those who go through childhood trauma often have a thing where they will not ask questions and clarification for fear of the person's response or what they think of them for asking the question. Another is not really knowing your worth to the course of your life. Another is not considering yourself. Those of us who struggle with having a sense of self, we tend to consider others way more than we consider ourselves. We don't really have an awareness that we have some personal power. Another is we don't really enjoy alone time. That can often be pretty triggering. Not really enjoying being social for the chameleon saying or not wanting to put our foot in our mouths or not trying to make mistakes. All of that are examples of sense of self issues. take some time here and write out some concrete examples where not having a sense of self had unwanted consequences on you in big and small ways. not saying no to something that was really damaging to you. Such as when you were trying to maybe break up with someone and they talked you into staying and that made things worse. To much smaller ideas, to smaller examples where you walk away from a conversation kind of going , ugh, why did I say I liked that book when I hated that book. Why did I do that to myself. I hate it when I do that. That kind of stuff. And a good place to take it from here is to start doing inner child work. Where you have active conversations with our undeveloped sense of self, our undeveloped inner child and gradually giving that child what's been missing the whole time which is some mirroring and some love. And I have a playlist that I'll put in the description of the video. It's a playlist on inner child work that you can start there. Inner child work is really having safe conversations from our loving inner adult. It's really the main ingredient to having a sense of self, I think.",

    "text": "Many of us might get that from a safe partnership, but we shouldn't solely rely on our partners for missing parental pieces. That's a common trap that happens in couples. how to do that. I would start by looking into joining interpersonal therapy groups or find a community of fellow childhood trauma survivors and start to engage as best as you can. Considering maybe looking into some 12-step program options. These are free options such as adult children of alcoholics, which does a lot of family-based inner child stuff. There's also Codependents Anonymous, and you really have to find meetings that work for you. And yes, 12-step programs have problems. I'm not going to sugarcoat or anything that. But there really are good meetings out there with good people who are working on different issues. You just really have to take it slow and kind of be careful and find the safe meetings with good people. for many of us, the worst thing that we struggle with is being around other people, but it's also the thing that gets the most healing, I think. And why I'm suggesting this for Sense of Self problems is, groups are really the place where we can learn to be more comfortable in our own skin and be among people while continuously separating ourselves from our family stuff. And separating the people in our lives from our family stuff. It's best, I think, if you can join a therapy group that isn't just learning something DBT, but where there's really kind of an in-depth back and forth among group members. I think that's ideal. I don't recommend just going for a tech space, online community, something , , Reddit or something that. Reddit is awesome to get a sense of things, but it's not real intimacy. I think the social piece is probably the most important piece of building or rebuilding a sense of self. Because being part of something, being accepted where you can take risk to be more authentic, really builds up our inner goodness and our sense of power and fights the shame and cuts down on the distrust that really gets in the way of having a solid sense of self. some final thoughts.",

    "text": "In this world of nervous system health and working with things complex PTSD, various forms of mental illness, which we are knowing now are actually a form of physiological illness that show up in the psyche, chronic illness, heart disease, cancer and cancers, autoimmune addiction, trouble connecting with people, trouble being able to sense our own bodies. All of these are connected to some form of what we would call dysregulation in the nervous system. again, coming back, trauma, from my point of view, is not the event per se. It is in the actual physiological body, somatic systems, the nervous system. that's number one that we have to understand. Number two, what is the nervous system. What is the body. And I know that you all have a body and some of you are going to be more adept and more skilled at being and masterful at being with this physical body of ours. Some of us are very good in the in, say, athletics and physical sports. Some are really good with more mind body. Some are really good with more physical body. Some are really good with more mind body techniques. Some of us are not in our body. But the nervous system, the autonomic nervous system, the ANS, this is responsible for our automatic pieces. I have to lay these foundations. The autonomic nervous system is comprised of two main nervous systems. One is the sympathetic nervous system. One is the parasympathetic nervous system. I'm not going to get into all the details. I'll mention where you can learn more of that in a second. But the sympathetic nervous system is more of the get up and go, fight, flight, protect, attack, defend, get the heart rate and blood pressure up that we can climb a flight of stairs, that we can run down the street. All these sorts of things. It gives us more blood to our muscles and to our system that we can act and move and be engaged and stimulated and activated. The parasympathetic nervous system means an ashamed being has to just say, , I'm not very good. I'm not even a completeataroy. I'm not doing my mission. And then the parasympathetic nervous system, as I mentioned just a while ago, that's a carcinogen. Otherwise, obviously, I'm going to find those things. You can't do any of those things.",

If you've ever seen dogs, they'll shiver and they'll shake. They'll release tension by doing a shake, by doing a stretch. And it's not that cat is thinking, I'm gonna get up and do some downward cat or downward dog. When you see a cat or a dog and they get up and they do those stretches, it is an automatic response in their body to reset the tone in their muscles that they can act. And walk and be agile and nimble and be there for threat if it comes. another little nugget here of how we gain more capacity to release stuff that's stored inside is we start to follow impulse in our body. We start to follow the things that occur internally that we often don't think of. This concept of, , , oh, , I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna do that. And then we have how we follow our impulse. the first thing I started with, again, a little bit of education,. We always wanna start with education. The second piece is dealing with stressors and troubles in the moment, in the now moment, they don't stick. And that takes practice. As humans, we have overridden, we have overrided our stress responses because we have this higher brain. this is why I was doing that little preamble of, , animal physiology, and we have this higher brain that is darn smart and darn complex that it can actually shut down and disconnect from what's happening in our physiology. This is a problem. It's when we're in a moment of absolute abuse, perhaps. We will maybe have to dissociate to handle what's happening to us. This is what occurs with folks who have had severe abuse, torture, that kind of thing. They will really disconnect from their physiology because it's too much to sense and feel. , we see this in private practice. We hear about this in stories, movies, all sorts of things that depict atrocities. And then the person is protecting.",

Or they're , , this just seems too boring. I got to find a little bit more intensity to bring my system back up to what it's used to. again, let's just say you're here because you want to understand how this trauma stuff works, how it is supposed to be released, how it is really released. As I said in the title, there's two situations that often people live in. Again, this sense of disconnection, dissociation, and then this sense of hyper aroused, looking for danger all the time. The interesting thing is these kind of, they kind of play together because someone who has more of that dissociative tendency, they're not going to be able to see how that person is doing. The person who's more of a dissociative tendency is often that because the high alert needing to look for danger all the time just became too exhausting. This is how someone ends up in what we would call adrenal fatigue, adrenal burnout, where the system has just collapsed. It has spent its whole life looking for danger. And it's maybe not there, but they're expecting it the system stays ramped. Again, hypothetically, you've got all this chronic stuff in your system due to the past that was scary, bad, and wasn't good. What do we do about it. First thing, education. You're doing that now. promise me that after this, you will do more education with me through my resources, through my programs, etc. The second thing is we have to learn how to follow our impulses. And by that, I mean, tracking our impulses. As a coach, I think I may need to provide some life and making sure that people understand that they are able to make that backup on their own. And then why don't you AND ME get your communications and laser calls chill out on a variety of things that might conflict your physical health and body biodiversity issues.",

It's these real life events. , maybe there was a death in the family the day that we were born and mom was distraught. There are many instances where this early stuff imprints on us.

Because if we are now saying our, I'm 45. let's say you're 45. Let's say you knew you were that baby that was not attuned to, wasn't securely attached to parents hated each other.

Or does it just guide your body on how to release the trauma. Or does it depend on how the bodywork is carried out. , it depends on how the bodywork is carried out. But what's more important is the person getting the bodywork and the person giving the bodywork. If they are not connected to their physiology, they might miss some very important stress responses that pop up while that person is, say, working with their lower back or their leg or whatever, or they're up here. , it doesn't matter where. The other one is acupuncture. That was another thing. I still, I consider acupuncture to be bodywork because you're shifting things in the body through pressure points, needles, meridians, etc. I have a story about acupuncture that I'll share. But I'm not going to go into that. I'm going to go into the bodywork. But it depends on the person. It depends on you.

But many of our students, I've never met them, and they do this on their own, but we're not asking them to do it on the first day. We're building up resource. We're building up containment. We're building up capacity. We're building up that smartness with the body. We're literally taking advantage of what I call neuroplastic healing sequencing. If you haven't checked out that piece of content, I talk about how we have to sequence our healing. We can't just go to the big kahuna at the very beginning. Someone said, how do we find the patience for this healing journey. You just find it. Just don't overthink it. I say this work is mundane. This work is just waking up and feeding yourself and cleaning and continually dusting your home and putting fuel in your car. And I'm not saying that's the best way to do it. I'm saying that's the best way to do it. I'm saying that's the best way to do it. I'm saying that's the best way to do it. I'm saying that's the best way to do it.

But there's this way of nurturing, sparking back up, getting our biological awareness back, our awareness with the world back, our capacity to be with our sensations is key. Our body is key. Our emotions are important, but they're actually less important than the physicality and the viscera, because it's the viscera in the body that creates the emotions. when we become really good biologically noticing ourselves, that's when we start to really get these emotions more in check. Someone asked, what about personality disorders or bipolar. I'm , , I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

I actually did a video on this called Functional Freeze Explained. maybe check that out. But most, there's a pretty strong preponderance in Western civilization.

The way that we work typically is through survival, especially when we're not connected to the physiology and the body,. yes, a hundred percent, yes. This is from Carrie. I just realized only today that I finally managed to listen to my body's impulses and let it rest with a long nap. Sounds simple, but it's huge for me. One hundred percent. And that comment goes really nicely with what the last person asked about being in a functional state, but really shut down. Many of our kids were raised pushing them past their comfort zone and overriding the structure in which they go to school. They're not allowed to often sleep till they're rested. The structure is, it's important to some degree, but it's also not allowing their systems to organically find what they need. We need discipline. We need structure and containment. But there's also this other element of allowing the human system to experience what it needs based on its needs, based on its preferences, based on the level of regulation, et cetera. one of the things that my students find really difficult to do is to, , to honor their systems need for rest. Because the moment we try to rest, there's a little bell that goes off in the physiology that says, don't do that. You're not supposed to do that. You're supposed to keep going. You're supposed to keep working. Because if you pause and stop, you might get attacked. You might get in trouble. And these are the things that we really have to be aware to. I can't stress enough.

Yes, we do have a shortage. If you want, the image we could take is that we are preparing a mass of soldiers, we are preparing a match where we should have 45 players, and we actually have an effective of 27. That is to say that we can train, we can do recruitment schools. The recruitment schools are -filled, in the first term, with about 20,000 per year. But the overall mass of the army, if we had to mobilize it, is too small for the challenges we should face in the defence. It's 120,000 compared to the capacities we would really need. It's not enough. And that's the imbalance we have today. Two, three, fire. Another problem, the equipment and the equipment, often worn out and insufficient. Wait, wait, wait. But the main gap we have is in the tanks, it's in the heavy training, in the artillery, the armored tanks, the Leopard. And that's where this gap must be now, today, compensated, in order to give ourselves the chance, with the heavy elements, to have this first force in combat, this defense force. The heavy training is now in the air. The heavy training is now in the air. The heavy training is now in the air. Here are these heavy training units, in exercise on the Col du Saint-Plon this winter. This mountain artillery company uses armored and armored M109s, which have more than 50 years of service.

The division leader estimates that only 3 out of 10 battalions, whether heavy or infantry, are equipped with the necessary equipment to fulfill their territorial defence mission. Whose fault is it. The political will is to do something big. It's simple. There was no political will to rearm us in a consistent way. Over the last 30 years, there has been no significant purchase of weapons. We have just filled in small gaps. In fact, all the available money has been invested in the maintenance of the existing equipment.

After the end of the Cold War, successive economic programs were cut into the fat and muscle of the military. In 1989, the Swiss people also took part in the war.

He was the head of the Civil and Military Security Service of the Vaud County for 20 years, before retiring a few months ago. We started from the principle that this era of Cold War, of bipolar world, of peace through nuclear dissuasion, would produce dividends of peace for eternity. And we have not ceased to reduce, to weaken, the capacity of defense of Switzerland. I want to prove that we made a first reform project called Army 95. Imagine that at that time, the geniuses of Bern had invented the fact that we could do a rehearsal every two years. It was largely enough to keep the know-how. Then we reduced the means of Army 21. And then the Parliament did not give the credits necessary to carry out Army 21. We had to do a sub-project called DEVA. And that's where we are today. we went from an army of 650,000 men to an army of a few hundred thousand men. It means everything. During these years of peace, the army's first mission was to help in the event of a catastrophe and promote peace. The reduction of military expenses also made profit for civil society, for example by investing public money in education or research. This is what we call the dividends of peace. Georg Gassler, himself a artillery colonel, is a renowned military expert who works for the influential German daily newspaper NZZ. The army was redirected towards supporting civil authorities. And we reduced the proper defense capacities. In terms of dividends of peace, it is estimated that Switzerland could benefit from 140 billion francs for other expenses. It is very clear that a bourgeois parliament, a federal bourgeois council, treated the army as a negligible quantity. During all the reforms, we were always promised that we could re-muscle the army in ten years, that it could be re-equipped and therefore ready. That was not the case. It is not much a matter of anticipation. We turned our gaze away. We did not want to return to the time when war was a means of leading a policy. Martin Pfister.

The instructions are good, the conduct is done. We are fulfilling the missions that are entrusted to us, for example in the field of disasters. But it is undeniable that we have great gaps in terms of equipment, ammunition, and we also lack certain capacities to respond to new forms of conflict. Today, conflicts are not just classic military conflicts. The current threat in terms of security goes far beyond. There are forms of hybrid warfare. For example, disinformation campaigns, espionage, attacks, attacks against our important institutions. It is therefore very important that we focus again on the capacity of defense of the army and on all other areas of security. It is obviously the war in Ukraine that has awakened the political Bern. At the end of 2024, the parliament gave a new government. The majority of the voted for the increase in the budget allocated to the Department of Defense. In 2024, it was 5. 7 billion francs. By 2028, the department will be able to spend 4 billion more. The goal is for military spending to reach 1 of GDP by 2032. Member of the Security Policy Commission, the Vaudois centrist Isabelle Chapuis, is one of the elected members who want to re-muscle the army that it is ready to engage in much more complex battle fields than ever before. The military is ready to engage in much more complex battle fields than ever before. It is true that the stock exchanges have been opened, and the parliament has shown very clearly that security has become a priority.

All this, we must do it away because it has already happened now. in fact, what is terrible is that we must, we cannot neglect one field to favour another. The left and the PS in the lead are opposed to the increase in the number of people in the military budget because they risk being made dependent on other areas, such as international cooperation. But there is also a divergence on what threatens Switzerland, as explained by the socialist from the Jurassic, Pierre-Alain Frid, member of the Security Policy Commission. The war is in Europe, but in fact it is not in Europe, it is at the border of Europe. And in fact, from my point of view, the security of the country, it is not questioned by the government. It is questioned by this war. On the other hand, there are threats, it is clear. Terrorism, cyber attack problems, misinformation, great crime, all that is obvious. Distance attacks by missiles, that is always a possibility because now it can go very far. And in the face of the real threat that concerns the country, there are indeed flaws. We are missing a lot of police officers. We are missing a high-level intelligence service. And then we have no air defense system that would allow us to fight with missiles. we hear noises, rearmament, which go in all directions.

And one of them was, he didn't have a good relationship with money at one point. And he said, every time I see money, I'm gonna thank money. I'm just gonna do this little simple practice inside that if I find a penny on the street, I'm gonna say, thank you. If someone gives me a million dollars, I'm gonna say, thank you. I'm just gonna say, thank you. Whenever I get any type of payment that comes into my bank account, thank you. Thank you. Gratitude, gratitude. And then he follows it up with saying, thank you money. Where do you wanna go. Do you wanna go in my bank account. Do you wanna go to an investment. Do you wanna buy a home with you. Do you wanna give you away. Do you wanna pay for someone's coffee. Where do you wanna go. And he has this direct relationship and he's very intentional every time money comes, where it's gonna go. He gives it a direction. He has this relationship with it and he's.

He just has a relationship with it that makes him feel emotionally safe and abundant. And food is energy and is money. Money is energy, food is energy. And when you eat things with a lower frequency within the food, it's gonna affect your energy physically. And you're gonna have a relationship with that constant eating. You're probably gonna gain weight. You might have inflammation. You're gonna get sick maybe at times. Your immune system's gonna be suppressed.

But it's getting uncomfortable and not saying I'm going to hoard all my money to myself. I'm also going to contribute it. I'm going to relax. The more I relax, the more I can receive. The more I can give. The more it can come back to me. it's shifting this mindset of , I'll give when I make money to, I'm going to give what I can now with the money I have, the time I have, the resources I have. And be generous now, as opposed to being generous later. That's for me, the most powerful mindset habit. Amazing. Amazing. Again, we've got seven habits here. We're just going to touch on one more. I want to ask you about the monetizing habit. -. Monetizing habit is figuring out your money. Exactly. Butit , fighters Appliation. , the want to do is not going to go into quá. create, create. It's just, it's a big deal. There you go. Cuz doing that I'm curious about, that I'm passionate about. I just started writing it down. And I was , how do you make money with this stuff.

I found a public speaking mentor. I found a writing mentor because I knew those would be tied to my goals of helping people in the world. And one guy was a professional speaker that I met. He said, if you want to influence people and impact people in a positive way, you need to learn how to communicate your message through public speaking. Whether you're in a boardroom and you work somewhere for 50 years, you're going to need to influence people in an office space, or you're speaking to the masses.

    "text": "But be careful, this explanation is not an apology, but merely an attempt to understand the context. Because long before he built the basement, Fritzl already showed a clear criminal profile. In 1967, when Elisabeth was just a year old, Fritzl was a young woman. She was a young woman, but she was a young woman. She was a young woman, but she was a young woman. When Elisabeth was just a year old, Fritzl was convicted of rape. He had entered the apartment of a 24-year-old nurse in Linz, threatened her with a knife and brutally raped her. He spent 18 months in prison, of which he was 12. This act is crucial for the overall picture. It proves that his sexual readiness for violence did not start with Elisabeth. It was an evolutionary escalation. From a violent but short crime to a decades-long systematic system of oppression. The basement was not a spontaneous idea, but the perfection of his criminal career. His genius, a word that can only be used in the absolutely negative sense, was in his ability to maintain a perfect facade of normality. He was the successful engineer and businessman who, with his wife Rosemarie, had been married since 1956 and led a large family. But behind this facade of the patriarch a sadistic stripper hid. His daily routine was meticulously planned. Every morning at 9 a. m. he disappeared in his basement, his alleged workshop. Even his wife was strictly forbidden to enter. This rigid control over his territory was the operative basis for his crimes. He created an absolute authority zone directly under the feet of his nameless family. The economic component of his actions is central here. Fritzl was not only the perpetrator, but also the sole provider of his victim and the children in the basement. Every meal, every piece of clothing, every piece of toys was a tool of control. By keeping them in complete financial dependence, he took away from them every possible opportunity to make them a victim. Fritzl was a man of his word. He took away from them every possibility of independence and bound them even more closely to himself. Their economic reality was a zero. He controlled the entire budget, the entire supply.",

Let me start with this and then you guys can respond to it. But when I started over 20 years ago, what I realized was, there were several books that had come out. codependency was had been kind of a term for 10-15 years by that time. But really what they were doing at that initial time was just identifying how certain relationships are different than healthy relationships. what are the characteristics of these not healthy relationships, and they began to identify the characteristics that became known as codependency. And books were written, and it was very helpful, it was very useful. But to me, the problem was, I had to be a codependent. And I'm not sure if it's in the book, but it was very helpful to me. And it was very helpful to me. And I was very interested in this, I'm very interested in this. And I think the problem was, is that nobody talked about, , where did these symptoms come from. , why are these people acting this way. It was all almost made they were born this way, or it was a pathology that was kind of, there's nothing you can do about it, you're screwed. That's just the way you are. And it's , No, I don't, can't buy that. And what I began to realize was, as you said when I was Mole and I was living with my son, I had experience with human to chamber away. I couldn't go all the way to the bathroom. If the thing paid me money, that was three capability today for me. But I realized, , now I know about something I can accept. I can accept it wouldn't work as long as something busier, it would do to me. If that doesn't work, I don't know what's going on even though I don't know.

When I think about, we bring the subconscious to the conscious mind,. I have awareness of , let's say I have awareness of the subconscious mind.

Or what are some things that people can do to kind of help. , I guess, take responsibility or ownership of that. , such an important question. the first thing to me is, what happens in complex trauma when a child has constant pain and being hurt and needs not being met, that they can't resolve, they're trying to resolve, but they can't fix the problem is they're living with constant pain. And nobody wants to live with constant pain. they either disconnect from their emotions, and shove their emotions down, and I'm not going to feel anymore. Or they deny. And they create a new story for their life that sounds happier. But the key thing is, they're not looking at it accurately. They're minimizing, they're denying, they're rationalizing, but nobody's being accurate. Somebody's blaming, but nobody's owning. And to begin with, you can't heal something unless you properly, accurately diagnose it. And that's painful to do that. But that has to be the starting point, you got to validate the truth, and get rid of the lies. The second piece to me, which is important is, when I talk to couples with codependency issues, how I describe it to them is this. The guy comes into the relationship, let's say it's a heterosexual, the guy comes in with his baggage, the woman comes in with her baggage, then they live together in codependency and create a third set of baggage. What most do when they go into counseling is they want to fix the third set of baggage. But nobody wants to fix their own personal baggage,. give me tools, give me tools. we don't keep hurting each other. , I can give you lots of tools. But if you don't deal with your own personal baggage, you're going to keep hurting each other. And that's the first step. And then the second step is to deal with the third set of baggage.

You can't set boundaries with me because that would be disrespectful. You can't say no to me. That would be disrespectful. You can't challenge me and call me on my stuff. there's all kinds of different things that are part of that kind of dynamics within the family that the child has just been trained in. It's the water they swim in, they don't even know it's there until they try to change it. All of a sudden, the family's mad at them. They're being a rebel. You're not cooperating with the program. You're not conforming. those kind of families, it's all about conformity. But what's really happening is you're asked to conform to what is unhealthy.

    "text": "First of all, thank you for letting us do this in your home. I'm really glad to get to have these conversations. I always enjoy these kind of conversations a lot. I'll give you a little background on why I found you, which was the main thing I started to become curious about is what constitutes abuse. And when someone is in a confusing situation, how do you begin to sort through the confusion of what the hell is going on. But you offered a side of the equation that I think a lot of people don't understand, which is insight into the abuser perspective. And the book that you wrote, which was the first book I read, which is Why Does He Do That. , which is literally the question that is in many people's heads, why, spoke directly to the struggle I was having to understand what was going on. anyway, I would love you to introduce yourself to the book. Introduce yourself and just say a little bit about your background and what you do, , what you did. I'm Lundy Bancroft, and I came into the domestic violence field about 30 years ago, more than 30 years ago now. And I came in on the offender end, and that's much of what shapes my perspective is the fact that the lion's share of my direct service experience was with the offender rather than with the abused woman. And there's a way, I guess, that when people think about domestic violence, their first image tends to be of an abused woman. Whereas my first image tends to be of an abuser. And that tends to be part of the soapbox I'm on, is try to get people to keep the offender front and center. , he's the source of the problem. , she's not the problem, he's the problem. I started to first volunteer and then become a staff member at what was actually the first counseling program specifically for men who abuse women in the country, called Emerge. It was in Cambridge, Massachusetts. And we had a really deep dive into, the abuser mentality because we were working with the abusers in groups. And a lot of what was essential to our experience and my experience was that we maintained telephone contact with the abused woman throughout the time that the man was in our program.",

    "text": ", where are the men. I don't know how to find that out, really. But I was surprised when I first came into the field how many men there already were then who had decided they want to be on the side of this thing. But I think there are more now. , I think now I hear a lot of young men, I hear a lot of young guys, 20 guys in their 20s, who are all sort of hyped up on gender justice and who have a very feminist orientation. I feel it's growing. One thing that I really to point out to people is that when a white person devotes themselves in all kinds of ways to fighting racism, and we know many, many white people who do that, we think, oh, they should be doing that. That's being on the cause of justice. , why wouldn't they be doing that. When a man, is someone who really devotes his life to fighting for women's , people immediately start to look at you , , what's up. And with me, they're always saying, oh, is your father an abuser. Or , , what's this really about. And I say, , now, wait a minute. Why shouldn't we take the same attitude with a man who's fighting for women's as we would do with white people who are fighting racism. Say, , that's what you ought to be doing. , you're fighting for something because it's. I want us to try our best to get the surprise out of that. And feel , , good, you're doing what you should be doing. Keep,. A couple other thoughts, if I might. One is that I notice all kinds of times people trying to address male violence while trying to avoid any discussion of male domination. And I think they end up doing harm for exactly the reason that you've pointed out, that you're actually missing much the key dynamic. And then one other sort of snippet that I to give, which is that when people hear about domestic abuse, they away start focusing on the man's anger and say, oh, he's got anger issues. , he's got problems with his anger. And one of my catchphrases about that is, no, he doesn't have a problem with his anger. He has a problem with her anger.",

But that's a real judgment call. At what point do I feel this person is really over and over again tearing me down. And the abuser will also work quite strategically. And this is one of the things, again, that people who don't know that much about domestic abuse have trouble accepting, is how much method there is to the madness. You can focus much on the madness and not notice how much method there is. if he notices, for example, that she has some mental health problems that she is battling with, he's going to keep throwing that up in her face all the time. Oh, you're just imagining this. You think I'm abusing you because you just see abuse everywhere. Or you think I'm abusing you because your parents abused you. That's become a popular one that abusers to use against the victim. And I tend to really encourage her to trust her perceptions. If she's going to, , sue him, then, yes, she needs more than her perceptions. But for her decision whether to be in the relationship or not or to go into distance, she doesn't need any proof that she has the at any point to back away from a relationship. Hey, what if you were wrong. , , maybe better say no. I'm more safe than sorry. A couple of other things I really watch people to look for is does he make her responsible for his actions. Because that's something that even if she has some mental health issues and she's wondering, , am I distorting this. It's , , that's something very concrete she can look at. Does she complain about things that he did and he says, , you caused me to do those things. , that's got to be a big flashing light there. , you made me angry or you made me this way or you made me that way. It's , , that doesn't justify his actions. Someone can make you feel things, but they can't make you do things unless they, , put you in danger. that's a big one to watch for. Is he saying that you cause what he does. Another big one to watch for is double standards.",

You're not even allowed to talk to a guy or have a man friend. Or he can spend money any way he wants, but you spend a little money and he's , you're wasting money. That's, I find, sometimes super clarifying and helpful to people who are trying to make sense out of what's happening is where there's double standards. But the main thing I tend to want to emphasize to someone is if you're afraid, assume that there's a problem. Don't assume that, oh, I'm just getting afraid for no reason. Maybe you're just getting afraid for no reason. I doubt it. But even if you are, it's it's too risky in case it's not for no reason. You've got to take it seriously. Actually, let me add one more thing, which is that a guy who's not abusive, if you say you really scared me, he's concerned about that. He's going to say, oh, geez, all , what do we need to change. And even if he feels he didn't do anything wrong, he's still going to want to know, , what was it. I'm going to learn this about you. , maybe I wasn't misbehaving. But now I've learned that there is a thing that I do sometimes that scares you. He'd want to know about that. He doesn't want her to be afraid. And if he says you scared me and his response is, , da, da, da, da, that's an abuser for sure. If you're having intuition, instinct that you're afraid of him, all things being equal, is it worth the risk to stay or is it not worth the risk. Because statistically it's a risk. Is it worth putting me, me and my kids, in danger to stay or not. , we know what the answer is. Whether you choose that or not is a different story. There also are sort of a series of levels to take distance in a relationship because people will think , , I'm not ready to leave this relationship, I'm going to leave it the way it is.

You don't have to be ready to decide that you're ending this relationship forever to decide it's not, this is not a safe situation to be at this level of intimacy. And you will also learn a lot from that because when you try to back away from a relationship is another way that you discover whether you're involved with an abuser or not. Because when you try to back away from a non-abusive man, he may be upset by that, but he's going to respect the limits you set. He's going to be concerned. He's going to be interested in working on what needs to be different. You back away from an abuser, he usually will not respect it. He's not going to have sex anymore for now. He's going to be push, push, pushing, pushing you for sex or outright sexually assaulting you. , then you're with an abuser. Or you say, what, I need to not talk to you for a week, and he's texting you 20 times. you're involved with an abuser. backing off some distance is often very, very clarifying and will help you to take steps that you need to take. Whereas, just try to wake up tomorrow morning and leave, who's ready to do that. No, that's a very big, hard move to make. With regard to blaming non-accountability, part of the original YouTube channel was geared toward people who are interested in personality disorders. And certainly for borderline, one of the things that good therapy does is it sort of positions you, the borderline person, in a place where you have to be sort of radically accountable for yourself and your actions. It may be almost too in extreme, but it means that, , look how you're actually doing. How your actions are impacting other people. And one of the things that seems pretty much common, , with abusers, is they absolutely do not take accountability for their actions. I mean, I think that's a general red flag in a romantic relationship, period, for someone you may not want to stick around with. But not everybody who isn't accountable is an abuser,. , that's my question.",

I mean, this sort of leads me to wonder the question that people who are in abusive relationships wonder if the person, the abuser, actually knows what they're doing or if they are just, , they don't know, and especially if they deny what they did. Can you talk about that experience and what the hell is really going on. I think the level of consciousness varies quite a bit among abusers. And that, for example, a lot of abusers, something 40 percent, still not half, certainly not 80 percent, but it's still a substantial number of abusers, grew up with an abusive dad or stepdad, , an abusive male in the home. And that means that a lot of what they do, they're just doing on automatic. They absorb that as what a man has a to do, and we should really see most of his abusive behaviors as forms of enforcement. He's trying to require her to do certain things that he's trying to make her do. , those kinds of enforcing behaviors he just absorbed, and they became automatic. when he doesn't what his partners are doing, he moves to enforce. And he just learned how to use the verbal abuse and the threats and the scary looks and all this different kind of stuff became automatic to him. One thing I'd to say to people about that, though, is don't confuse something that's automatic with something that's accidental. It doesn't mean that it's accidental. I'll give you an example. If there's a glass of water sitting on a table, and I go this and knock the glass off, we can argue about how much thought or premeditation went into that, but we can't argue that it was an accident. That is not an accident. whatever the abuser's level of consciousness may be, and it varies, it's not an accident. He may not be aware of his own reasons. He's often not aware of his own reasons.

It then unfortunately dovetails with the way that an abuser cuts the woman off from other people. Because if you're very isolated, and an abused woman does tend to become, not always, but does tend to become increasingly isolated over time, that's going to increase the impact of the one voice that you're hearing. If the one voice that you're hearing is the only voice that you're hearing, it gets more and more power, more and more opportunity to define what is real.

But any ordinary human being who hasn't had super specialized high level agent type training, this stuff is going to affect you. You cannot grow up with a parent who tells you're stupid every day and not have that creep into you. You cannot have a partner who tells you're stupid every day and not have that creep into you.

    "text": "one of the things that I tend to say to moms, and nothing's foolproof unfortunately, but one of the things I tend to say to moms is, the abuser is going to be saying, think me, think me, think me, and your temptation is going to be to say to him, no, think me, think me, think me, and he's going to win because you're playing to his strengths. you really have to teach kids to think for themselves. Dr. hm. when he's saying, think me, think me, think me, rather than saying, no, no, he's wrong, it's more this, you have to keep saying to the kid, what do you think. And let's look at this. And any games that you can play with them that encourage them to figure things out for themselves. Great conversation with kids is to talk about advertising. Because advertising is manipulation, with all due respect to people whose relatives work in advertising. The goal of advertising is to mislead you into believing that something is going to have an effect on your life that it's not going to have. Even a fairly good product that may have a good effect on your life, it's not going to have the effect that they're saying it's going to have. And they're out to convince you that the reason they want you to do this is because it would be good for you. When obviously the reason they want you to do this is because it would be good for them. advertising is manipulation. It is manipulation. It's working just the way manipulators work for exactly the same reason. teaching kids to read advertising is a great way to prepare them to think for themselves in the face of manipulation. And as you're pointing out, you can't say anything very critical about the abuser because he may catch on that you're saying that. And also, he often is the children's father, they don't want to hear anything bad about him. If he's their stepdad, they're much less sensitive about it. You can usually get away with being more obviously analytical about him. And if he's their father, you can't usually be obviously analytical about him. what you have to do is equip them with the ability to analyze and leave it to them to apply it to him. And kids see many ads.",

And why are they making it look this kid suddenly won a prize because they got the new sneakers or whatever. And then for younger kids, I really, up to about age five, I was , I'm going to be a kid. Five or six. I really recommend the Russell Hoban book, A Bargain for Francis. And it's just, it's a children's story. Very entertaining. Kids aren't going to feel they're being preached to by the story, but it actually teaches them to recognize manipulation. And not only that, but it covers many of the key tactics that manipulators use. And it's just, boy, if you've got a kid who has a key manipulator in their life, a dad or stepdad who's a manipulator, and you want to teach him to read. Teach him some skills for reading that without saying anything bad about him. A bargain for Francis. And you recommend not saying bad things about the other parent to the kid if the other parent's an abuser. It won't work for a number of reasons. One is if he finds out you're saying that, you're going to pay, and the kid's going to pay. But the other thing is the kids, kids don't want to hear bad things about their parents. Kids often want to say bad things about their parents themselves. Sure. But they don't want other people saying bad things about their parents. But you can't. You can't often name behaviors as wrong without them getting defensive. you can say that's not that he did such and such, or he shouldn't have put you in that position, or he shouldn't have said that to you, or he shouldn't have scared you. That stuff is , fine to say. But don't ever say things that evaluate him as a person. Don't say he's mean, or as kids start to understand abuse, don't say he's abusive or he's an abuser. Avoid characterizations of him as a person. I would even avoid characterizations of his behavior. I wouldn't even say his behavior is abusive. I wouldn't even say his behavior is abusive.

But the other thing that kids do need to hear is that adults are responsible for their own actions. And part of the goal of childhood is to gradually become, by the time you reach adulthood, able to be fully responsible for your own actions. But we don't consider kids fully responsible for their own actions. That's why we have juvenile courts, , instead of adult courts. And we're trying to move them. We're trying to move them in that direction. But they need to understand that adults are responsible for their own actions, because they're going to hear all kinds of things from him that he isn't. And kids need to hear, you're not causing what he does, and mom isn't causing what he does. And those are things that need to be explicitly said to kids. Again, that doesn't involve saying anything bad about him, to say you don't cause what he does, and mom doesn't cause what he does. Your siblings don't cause what he does. One of the big sources of harm in a family where you have the domestic abuser is that everybody. Everybody starts to blame each other. He's conditioning them to all blame each other for what's going on. And then they start to do a lot of damage to each other, what you might call secondary damage, where they're starting to hurt each other a lot because of dynamics that he's put into motion. And we want to try to break that up by saying to kids, hey, don't blame each other. Don't blame yourself for what he did. Don't blame each other for what he did. Don't blame mom for what he did. He's responsible for his own behavior. You're angry at mom about what she did. That's fine. But don't get mad at her about what he did. That's not her fault. Is the intention to turn the child against the mother. What is it in the dynamic. When an abuser is sowing divisions between moms and kids, a lot of the intention is to turn children against the mom. But also the intention is to make the mom's parenting life more difficult, to make her be under more stress, to undermine her authority.",

We don't really know the method. But what we don't see is Jonah wondering, was that my voice in my head that told me that. Or was that the devil that told me to do that. Or was it really God. Maybe I just misheard things. That's not what we see. He knew that it was God's voice. But then what did he do. What did he do. the story, he hears God's voice and then does he listen and obey. No, he doesn't. He runs away. He goes the other direction in total disobedience. And that's what led him to the belly of the fish that we read about in the story. I think it raises an important question for you and for me, for all of us. And it's a deep question. How do I hear God's voice. How do I hear. How do I hear God's voice. Because if Jonah heard God's voice and he still disobeyed, then what about us. How does God speak now. How do we really know it's him. How do we really know it's not just our own thoughts and our own feelings. Or even worse, how do we know that it's not just a trick of the enemy that is designed to lead us off course. , I think in order to establish how we hear God's voice, we need to know that God's voice is not just a trick. And , in order to hear God's voice, first we have to believe that God still speaks today. This is an important step in the process here. Because if you don't believe that God is active and that he is involved in the world, that he's involved in his creation, that he's involved in people today, if you don't believe that, then there's no point in really trying to hear his voice. Maybe you don't even believe that there is a God. Maybe you don't believe that there is one, but he's not involved. He's just far off somewhere. Maybe he even created us, but he's not active and involved in our everyday lives. If that's what you believe, then you may not really care about hearing God's voice.",

But as a follow-up to that, the what do we do part, we've got to be able to discern His voice. today, I want to just unpack with you four ways that we can hear and discern God's voice. Because here's the bottom line, if we're going to follow God, if we're going to obey Him, then we have to be able to hear Him clearly. How can you follow and obey if you don't know what you're following or obeying. here's the first one of the four ways that we can hear from the Lord. I'd say four major ways. The first one is that God speaks through us. He speaks through His Word. Also, we call that the Bible. He speaks through His Word. And I really want to emphasize that this is the primary way that God speaks to His people. The Apostle Paul said in 2 Timothy 3. 16, all Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is. God uses it to prepare and equip His people to do every good work. did you catch that in the beginning there that all Scripture is inspired by God. Other translations say that it is God-breathed. That means when you open your Bible, you are hearing what God has to say. This is the primary way. The Bible is the primary way that He speaks to us.",

And I've sat where you are and wondered about this same dilemma and just thinking, oh, , pastor, but the Bible has a lot of different things in it. It has some pretty intense stuff. If you go back to the Old Testament, it's got some pretty violent things, pretty grotesque things, things that sound harsh and judgmental. how does all of that fit into hearing the voice of God today. Dr. Joseph McClary, M. D. : Maybe you've wondered that before, or maybe even now. You're wondering, how does all this work. And it's really an important question to ask. let's talk about it for a minute. One of the keys to bridging the gap, which we could say that there's a gap between the God of the Old Testament and the God of the New Testament, is this, that it's the idea that God has always been the same. Let's start there. He's always been holy. He's always been a God. He's always been a God of justice. He's always been a God of mercy. But here's the thing, the way that God relates to people has shifted depending on which covenant has been in effect,. the way that God relates to people has shifted depending on which covenant has been in effect. This is important. in the Old Testament, or we could say the old covenant, God gave this nation of Israel some really specific laws. Some were laws about worship, some were about sacrifice, some were ceremonial type laws, some were about how their society should run as a nation. They weren't all just religious laws. Some were moral commands that reflected God's character and God's eternal nature. And , these civil laws and these ceremonial laws that existed in the Jewish temple, they were good and they were for Israel in that season. But they were also pointing forward to something greater. They were pointing forward to the ultimate redemption, the ultimate sacrifice to the coming of Jesus in the New Testament.",

Because remember, He said, I don't do just what I want to do. I do what the Father says to do. He would get downloads from the Father. This is where He would disconnect from the craziness of ministry and travel and people always pulling on Him with needs. He would disconnect from just life and relationships and from people's expectations. This is where He would disconnect from. He would recharge His spiritual batteries. I think it's appropriate to say that prayer is a conversation with God, which means that prayer is listening to God also. There's one image that I've done before that I heard about a long time ago. every now and then I'll do it. And I encourage you to try it if you've never tried it. Wherever you are, if you're in your living room or your bedroom or somewhere where there's. somewhere you can sit and then there's another chair. And put it in front of you. And then as you pray, imagine that Jesus is sitting in that chair facing you. You think, oh, that's silly. , come on, it's quite an imagination. Just try it. I think it will be more impactful than you think if you've never done it. Just imagine that He's there. What is He doing. What is He saying. How is He reacting to what you're praying. Just try it. And if you want, come and tell me about it. I'd love to hear about what happens. All. I want to also give you a couple safeguards as we go along today. One is here that when it comes to hearing the voice of the Holy Spirit, there's a safeguard here. That if what you think God is saying to you, if that contradicts the revelation of God in the Bible, then it is not God. If it contradicts God's Word, it's not God. I've seen these things happen where God will say, or people will say, , God told me to do this or that. And if it's out of alignment, especially with what we see in the New Testament, then it's not of God.",

    "text": "They gave them a covering. The Holy Spirit spoke. But he did in the context of a church community. they discerned God's voice together. Remember that Jonah, he did not do that. No part in the story does he go to anybody else and ask them, Hey, I think God might have said this, but I'm thinking I might run the other way. What do you think. I think I might go to Tarshish instead. Just get away from it entirely. He didn't bounce that idea off of anybody. Of course, if he would have, they would have said, You're crazy. What did he do instead. He isolated himself. He got just with his own thoughts. And when we isolate, we are open to deception. Let me say that again. When we isolate from the body of Christ, we are open for deception from the enemy. We are vulnerable and the enemy starts licking his chops. Because the deer or the gazelle or the one that breaks away from the pack, that's the one that the. The big cat in the weeds looks at and says, That's the one we can track down. They have no protection. They have no other thoughts, no other people around to look at what they're looking at. That's how people get. Maybe you've heard the term catfished. Anybody ever heard that. Catfished, where people pretend to be someone and they go online and they act they're a young woman or something. And the man is , Oh, man. This one. This one. This woman is beautiful. And they talk for a year. And yet the whole time, it's a 62-year-old man on the other side trying to talk to him and to trick him and get money and whatever. That's being catfished. , you don't hear a lot of stories about people who are catfished that ran that by their friends and family. It's not the whole group was deceived. It's one person isolating and they get tricked. here's another danger. There's the danger of saying. God told me. I'm not saying we never say that. I'm just saying be careful with that phrase, God told me. Because too often what people do is use that a trump card. That you. God told me, you can't say anything. There's nothing you could say higher than that. God told me, I'm doing it.",

Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians. 1 Thessalonians 5. 19 Do not stifle the Holy Spirit. Do not scoff at prophecies. But test everything that is said. Hold on to what is good. See, that's the balance. That we don't want to shut down the idea that God still speaks. And that He could tell you something now. But we don't just accept every thought or impression either. We test it. We could say, as a mentor of mine said one time. You eat the meat and spit out. You spit out the bones. That we test it. And some of it may not be on point. But some of it might be. we take the good. I think it's just better to have a posture of humility. Instead of saying, , God told me. Say something , I believe that God may be leading me to this. God may be leading me this way. And then invite others to help test it. Am I missing it here, guys. Am I. Is this. Do you believe. Do you discern. This is from the Lord. I'm going to ask you to pray and help me. If you do it that way, that shows that you care more about God's will and really hearing Him. Than you do your own agenda and your own wants and desires.

You can't just throw that out there as the trump card. here's the safeguard with hearing with God speaking through his people. Is that make sure that you value the voice of mature believers.

You got to slow down and you got to listen because God often confirms his voice through his people. for example, if you believe that God is telling you that you're going to be a missionary. You're called to be a missionary. You're called to be a missionary overseas. What you don't do is you just go the next day and buy a plane ticket and get a brand new suitcase for travel. That's the wrong move. First, ask some important questions , hey, does this what I believe God's telling me. Does it line up with scripture. , , the Great Commission says go into all the world and make disciples of all nations. , it lines up with scripture. , then ask yourself, do I have peace from the Holy Spirit about this specific calling. Is I rest wrestle with it and discern. And test it. Does it sit within me or do I have this uneasy churning. No peace. And if you do have peace, then you bring it to others. Bring it to church leadership. For example, the hope is that they would affirm what you're hearing that they would agree with this calling on your life. But if they have some concerns or they suggest some steps or some prerequisites first should probably listen to them. You should probably follow their guidance. God speaks through his people and this applies to anything that you believe God is telling you. It's really a picture of how to hear God's voice in a healthy way. It's not having a lack of faith or a lack of courage by listening to others. And , just don't give in you. God told you no, it's being wise. the key is to be humble. It's to be biblical and it's to be involved in a solid community of faith. And then be ready to obey when God opens the door when he says now be ready to move. And that leads us to our last one. We'll just take a few more extra minutes here. Number four is that God speaks through our circumstances. God speaks through our circumstances. Romans 8 28.",

Other times we have an open door and we think oh God is wanting me to walk through the door. We just assume but it could be the enemy trying to steer us off course into something that we don't need to be a part of. don't base your decisions solely on whether it's an easy door to walk through or not. God works in different ways. here's a simple test that we can use and maybe if there's something to remember or something sticky today that you can take away. This maybe is it if we want to discern God's voice. We look at scripture, his spirit, the Saints, and if it makes sense. first thing is scripture. Does it line up with the Bible. What I believe I'm hearing line up. The spirit. Do I have a sense of godly peace about it. And then the Saints. We don't usually call ourselves Saints, but we'll take it. Do other believers affirm it. And then sense wisdom. Does it reflect God's character and wisdom. Or, is this out of alignment with who God is and what he does in his revelation in scripture. But if it passes this test, then we can move forward confidently in faith that the Lord is speaking. we really do believe that God is speaking today that he speaks through his word through his spirit speaks through his people. And he speaks through his Providence over the circumstances that we face that we might find ourselves in even today. the real question is not does God speak. The real question.

What is important is to find out, it is not at all about being an optimized person afterwards, or working better, or not being able to do it. The handling of small challenges is suddenly a different one, namely no longer much a fear-affected person, not even a guilt-affected person. And that just makes life more valuable. There is an explanation for the difficulties in thinking, planning and acting. The transmission of the stimulus, i. e. the information from one nerve cell to the next, takes place with the help of botulism. But these are often not available in sufficient quantities in certain brain regions in ADHS learning. Here, drugs with the active ingredient methylphenidate are used. They strengthen the transmission of information, and then you can concentrate better again. But that stuff doesn't pop up, in the sense that you are not high when you take a drug betaline. Interestingly, not exactly. That is the difference with a neurodivergent person. And that is why I also call ADHS a kind of diabetes in the head. there is simply a biochemical insufficiency. And that makes the change. And there is no character insufficiency. Exactly. Because someone who has diabetes, you wouldn't say, yes, have you ever tried good music. Or, , your parents must have misled you that you have diabetes now, or something that. That would never be heard by someone who has diabetes. Now I have told you an incredible amount about my experience. What are the aspects where you think you have recognized yourself again. In many respects, to be honest. Of course, I have already worked as a doctor in practice, in children's and youth psychiatry, with a large number of boys who were hyperactive. Also always comforted with, , I'm not them. And what I find totally exciting is that we underestimated how many different variations there can be. And that only because you don't have this hyperactive, you can still have a lot to do with other facets of ADHS. The encounter with Samira made me think. Do I have that too.

Here in virtual reality, my brain waves are measured while I try not to be distracted by the chaos in a virtual classroom. Not easy. In school, of course, I was the one with the paper plane. But now I have to concentrate. Stop with the crap. Maybe in the future ADHS symptoms will also be objectively measurable on the computer. a lot about my inner self. You also know the question, Bögen. Does that give you a coherent picture. Overall, I have the impression that ADHS has something to do with it. There are certainly people who are even more affected. And they were also able to compensate a lot. With stimulation, with impulsiveness. Earlier they said they actually led three lives in parallel. I would say from the first impression, also with the look-alike, with the question arches, that it is moderately shaped. Does that fit as a moderator. Yes, exactly. That fits as a moderator. Otherwise it would have been the job. Good to know. Dr. Philipsen gave me a few behavioral therapy tips away. In particular, sports help against inner unrest and a self-reliant environment for work.

Sadly, there isn't much that you can do from a prevention standpoint. It's an exhausting life to have to continually monitor your life and wonder, is that person going to become a flying monkey. Is that person going to become a flying monkey. It's no way to live. In some ways, all you can do is go through your life as your best you. And if the people around you don't seem to understand narcissism, be careful around them because they are the ones that will be the most recruitable. They are the ones that will be the most useful as flying monkeys. It's really where we can address the flying monkeys is what you do as it's happening or after it happens. Number one, you've got to hold on to your reality. It's very easy to be gaslighted and start to doubt yourself and feel deeply confused when lots of people are sharing the same distorted narrative. Trust yourself. There can be much grief when you're experiencing the whole flying monkey phenomenon and that grief can drain you and sometimes leave you doubting yourself even more. you. what you experienced. And even if the flying monkeys want to gaslight you alongside the narcissist, you've got to hold on to your reality. Number two, don't try to convert the flying monkeys. The group of flying monkeys with the narcissist leading the fray can feel a little bit culty. And sometimes the flying monkeys can get really zealous about their support of the narcissist and the idea that you may be to blame. All you can do is calmly, calmly and gracefully stand in your truth. Even if you're angry inside, don't get into the mud with them. They will want to hear your side of things and if you choose to do that, stick to the behaviors of the narcissist and don't get lost in talking about gaslighting and narcissism and other words that might put them on the defensive. Because when you use those words with flying monkeys, they'll often push back and try to paint you as the bad person. Number three, keep in mind that sometimes flying monkeys come back around.",

Just when a person hits the breaking point with a narcissistic person, that the rage and all of the invalidation and the berating and the humiliation finally gets to a person and they take a stand against the narcissist. The narcissist is masterful at playing the sulking petulant victim. And because most people stuck in narcissistic relationships tend to be pretty good, kind, compassionate, and they're not going to be empathic people. They struggle with seeing the sort of the consequences that leave the narcissist looking victimized and sad, and they recant and they find themselves trying to cheer up the victimized narcissist because people who've suffered narcissistic abuse are uncomfortable with that tension, with that conflict. It's a brilliant, but sick maneuver by the narcissistic person. In one quick second, they are able to turn the tables from someone actually being rude to them. And they're able to turn the tables from someone actually being really angry with them or upset about them to someone trying to appease them. In many cases, narcissistic people are good at playing the victim that people tend to forget the bullying sequence that just happened and just focus their energies on making sure that the narcissist is. Another way that the victim bully sequence plays out is when you do call them out on their bad behavior. They try to play it off as a joke, but they don't. And they don't. And they don't. And they don't. And they don't. And that's when you're able to get rid of it, but you can actually take a joke. You may say, what you just did or said it was hurtful, or it was wrong.

I cannot do this. I cannot be gaslighted by this system any longer. It's not. And I see it and it's not gonna change. And then you decide to step away and then you're met with anger that you went no contact, but there were never any attempts by people within that family system to change. It doesn't feel good. The whole flying monkey mess that follows up, that doesn't feel good either. But when you go no contact with your parent, it is your parent. to do this, to go no contact brings up primal feelings of abandonment, shame, fear, and grief. The reckoning that nothing you could have done would have made it better since childhood. And that's a heavy weight to carry. To recognize that for you to finally be you, to live honestly as yourself, to show up as you, that the only way that was gonna be able to happen in some cases was that you had to break out of this system, and that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna get out of this system and that recognition hurts. Family estrangement is viewed very negatively and certainly nobody signs up for it. Everybody just wishes for and craves a loving, attuned and consistent family. Many of us don't get it. But because the estranger is always the one viewed as the problem, it makes this hard. When people judge estrangement, they do not focus on the abusive behavior that would have led up to the fact that they were abused.

Estrangement shaming is pretty common. And as you can imagine, when it comes to narcissistic family system, it is often a tool, this idea of no contact or estrangement, that works very. Sadly, it can become the case, that ongoing contact with the narcissistic family system can be quite harmful. And that by the time a person goes no contact with a narcissistic family system, that they have suffered and suffered, and hoped and hoped, and tried and tried, and had those hopes dashed, and tried, and blamed themselves, and radical acceptance, then often becomes the catalyst to no contact. It is a, big decision to make. Because to go no contact can upend a family system. Because it is all but impossible to go no contact with just one family member. Especially a family that has, that's connected to each other. Oftentimes going no contact means you lose everyone. And not everyone wants that. But the assumption that the person who makes the decision to go no contact, is simply a petulant adult baby person, is wrong. I've worked with clients in a range of situations. Some of them have gone no contact with selected family members, and sometimes with entire family systems for years. And there was grief, and a sense of loss, but ultimately a sense of peace. Not one of them regretted it. They definitely regretted that this was their lot, that this was their story. But they didn't regret the decision that they made. Others couldn't go no contact for a range of reasons. Culture, a close attachment to other family members that they would lose if they went no contact with anyone. Fear. And they found themselves on a revolving carousel of ongoing abuse, that they would often attempt to do work arounds on. None of them came to these decisions lightly. And many of the ones who could not do no contact, often wished they could, and recognized very clearly how much easier their lives, and how much better their overall health would be, if they did not have to maintain contact. Now obviously, narcissism and other forms of antagonistic personality styles in family members, are not the only reason that people go no contact.",

And it's one that can take people a long time to get to. It takes as long as it takes. I want to throw in one last piece here, which is that we often treat estrangement and no contact as a forever kind of a situation. Some people need time down. What we talk a lot about when we're talking about what happens, especially in narcissistic family systems, the fancy word for it is a loss of subjectivity. Basically, you lose your sense of self. You lose your identity. You don't even know who your authentic self is. And as long as you're in that family, you have to sort of fit your square peg into their round hole kind of thing. And that the only way to really find yourself is to separate out from that system for some period of time. For some people, that's a couple of years. For some people, that's a decade or longer. And at the end of that time, sometimes there's an event, a catalyzing event. It could be a death. It could be an illness. It could be a coincidence. And there may be an event that puts you back in the fold with that family. And in some cases, you may find that now that you're fully possessed of who you are, what you're about, that you can stand strong in the face of it and give yourself permission to step away, that some people may find that there's an opportunity for repair where others will say, this will always and forever be a traumatizing system.

And it's important to have a safe space to talk about that with the therapist who gets it, with the goal of ensuring that you don't replicate these cycles in adulthood, that you don't slide off into a place where you take on a more victimized role, and that you can step into adult roles informed with empathy and grace that come from having done some of your hardest yards when you were in childhood. I hope this was helpful. Thanks again.",

    "text": "Hey everyone, it's Dr. Ramani. Let's talk about consequences,. Consequences are what happen after a behavior and shape whether that behavior happens again. what kinds of consequences matter to a narcissistic person. The universal piece is that consequences shape behavior, but the other piece is what consequences matter. we know blah, blah, blah, narcissistic people won't change, but we often need to make these relationships work. And the only way that can happen is if we can shape their behavior somewhat,. The way we shape anyone's behavior is the consequences we set for someone's behavior. Behavior is shaped by consequences,. Pay me extra for the extra work. I'm going to want to keep doing the extra work. Give a person frequent, flyer miles and perks, they may keep flying your airline. Give a kid a gold star, he may keep making his bed,. It's not quite that simple, but it's also kind of that simple,. I mean, listen, with animals, this is much easier. Food is almost always rewarding for every animal,. You give your pup a treat after they do whatever thing you want them to do, and we assume that they keep getting the treat. When they keep doing the thing you want, we can shape their behavior they'll keep learning to do the thing we want them to do. They'll keep doing the thing we want them to do, and we can shape their behavior. they'll keep learning to do the thing we want them to do. They'll keep learning to do the thing we want them to do. They'll become a habit. Every often we'll reward them, and that'll be enough. For people, this can be a lot more complicated. Because with people, unlike animals, where food is almost always rewarding, we have to figure out what is rewarding for someone,. If you give that person who does that extra work just five bucks, that may not be enough to interest them in doing that again. But a much more meaningful amount of money, or perhaps something that might be even more meaningful to them, maybe a day off, or a better party, or maybe a day off, or maybe a parking spot, that may then result in the desired behavior to repeat. We gotta figure out for each person what matters. Now that's rewards,. That stuff's called positive reinforcement.",

    "text": "But what about other kinds of consequences. Punishment, for example, is a consequence,. We give someone something aversive. We do something to someone that's aversive with the goal that they stop the behavior. A speeding ticket, being grounded for coming home late, docking a person's pay for not showing up. You want them to stop the thing they're doing, you penalize them,. Now punishment, we know, doesn't work as those rewards, as that positive reinforcement to shape behavior. But if a consequence is aversive enough, losing a driver's license, missing out on a really a fun event, losing a job, then just the possibility of the consequence may be enough to keep a person in line. And you don't even have to deliver the consequence, because they don't want it to happen. But the consequence of the behavior has to be meaningful to a person if it's going to change or shape their behavior. And this is where it gets tricky with narcissistic folks. Many of you may think, listen, I can't get out of this relationship, or I have to have an ongoing contact with this person. I have to figure out some kind of consequence, their behavior isn't awful. Or you may want to figure out a reward that will get them to repeat a behavior that you want them to do. Let's break down this whole consequence problem a little bit. first, when you're thinking about this in terms of narcissistic people, let's start with what is meaningful to narcissistic people as a reward. For most narcissistic folks, validation and admiration and other clear sources of narcissistic supply are incredibly motivating. that will include effusive praise, attention, applause, being told they're great, overblown gratitude. It may also be proximity to important people or VIPs or people whom they perceive to be VIPs or being at the concert, the event, the party, whatever the hit or the bad. And it's a lot of things that are important to them. let's start with the reward. let's start with the reward. let's start with the reward. First of all, think about what the hip or cultural credit that gives them status is. Other things may include high status items, cars, clothing, jewelry, watches, boats.",

    "text": "If the narcissistic person is mad at someone or believes that they have been wronged by someone, it may also be either seeing the narcissistic person's own attempt at getting revenge succeed or watching that the person that they perceive as doing them wrong going down. If the narcissistic person thinks their revenge is working or their baiting is working, they're going to keep doing it. That's tricky. What do you do with consequences there. you might be thinking, but what about when they do things that I do not. What about those behaviors I just want them to stop. What then. Now that gets a lot more complicated. If we know what constitutes the strongest narcissistic supply for them, , we can build on that to figure out what will make them. Uncomfortable. And that would be losing supply, less attention, admiration, and validation, taking those things away. when they're yammering on one more time about something in their life, that's they don't , or that they don't agree with, or someone's doing them wrong. Don't engage with them. This is why techniques gray rock exist. It's basically a way of taking away narcissistic supply. Another sort of way of giving a consequence. It's by not noticing something in them. They're wearing some fancy new thing or engaging in some kind of grandiose prattle about something they did. And you may just nod and say, , cool. That sounds fun. And they want you to, Ooh, and , Ooh, you had the front row ticket. Nobody could get those tickets. You not doing that turns you into less interesting supply. If you're fortunate, they may take their ridiculous conversations elsewhere. this is again, where it gets a lot more difficult. Let's think about a difficult conversation. For example, they're gaslighting you or baiting you, , intellectually that if you get into the mud with them, it is going to escalate and just keep getting worse at those times. Cause you don't want that to keep happening. The best consequence is to disengage. Even when they escalate and say worse and worse things. Remember what the reward for them is you losing it, you getting angry, you showing emotion. If you do that, you are in essence, giving them that honestly positive reward. And they're going to do it again. You may think that's ridiculous.",

Other consequences for the narcissistic person that are meaningful. One is when they do what we call losing face, when they look bad socially, this isn't really about shaping their behavior, but just knowing that when they aren't the good one, the center of attention, the winner, then for a lot of narcissistic folks that can really unsettle them. Now, that's a very tough consequence for you to issue. Because they're not the one. Because it can just as easily backfire on you. If you're trying to paint them in a bad light to others, the best thing you can do is just let them be them. Because at some point they will lose face. It's inevitable with them that they'll behave badly. Sometimes us engaging with them doesn't let that natural process unfold. Let them be the ones who do it. Now another loss for them is a loss of success or attainment or looking back or their work not going the way they want. And again, there often isn't much you can do to make that happen in most cases as a consequence, but when it does, it's definitely a meaningful consequence for them. For example, let's say they mismanage money at work or behave inappropriately at work and they get called out on it. They will typically go down the witch hunt rabbit hole or blame other people. But if there are real losses for them, loss of a professional title, a license, a reputation, a public image. Ooh, that is a very, very big loss. And again, there often isn't much you can do to make that happen in most cases as a consequence. just being able to make that happen is a very, very meaningful consequence for them. Again, it just may be a consequence you may not be able to generate. What's another big consequence for narcissistic folks. When they lose superficial stuff literal stuff, money, fancy house, that's a big loss, but also another consequence. And the interesting thing about this consequence is that it will happen. This consequence I'm about to talk about is about, will happen to every narcissistic person.",

    "text": "This exercise we're about to do together is, in my opinion, life changing. It will fundamentally transform how you interact with painful thoughts and emotions and relationships. You'll practice creating space for them that you can be less reactive and more intentional in your actions. It's a powerful transformative exercise, and at the same time it's not difficult to practice. It's a simple skill, and I've invited mindfulness expert Thomas McConkie to join us to teach it. As this exercise is designed to work with disturbances or uncomfortable emotions, it's going to be a little uncomfortable. But if you find yourself getting overwhelmed, feel free to take a break, do something comforting, and then come back to this exercise when you feel more resourced or safe. This exercise is about 12 minutes, and I've made a longer version of this video where I debrief and explore my experience with Thomas, because each time I do this exercise, something inside of me changes. The first couple times it was pretty mind-blowing for me. if you struggle or feel confused during the exercise, definitely check out the longer version of the video to explore the why. , without further ado, let's jump in. One of the things I've noticed is that for a lot of people, they have a hard time feeling their feelings. , they don't know what it means, to feel their feelings, and that could include their emotions. , they don't quite know what it means to feel what their emotions are saying. But they also don't know how to sit with their body's sensations and what's going on there. And I think a lot of people have a tendency to distract themselves or avoid having these feelings, whether they're emotional or physical, or they maybe suppress them. They try not to feel them, they're maybe afraid of them. -. Or they intellectualize or distract themselves mentally that they don't have to sit with them. And that's what I'm hoping you can talk with us about today, Thomas. I'm excited to talk about this today. I'm happy to. I love the introduction. It needs no embellishment, but if I were to add anything, I would just say from a Buddhist perspective that yes, we all do that as human beings.",

Totally. Exactly. All of those could be a threat. Something that is triggering. A trigger from any context. And, , that gets processed through the amygdala, which is the part of your brain that processes emotion. And then the amygdala interprets what it's sensing and what's coming into it. And if it interprets it as a threat, then it's going to send signals to other parts of your brain, specifically the hypothalamus. And then the hypothalamus is going to start this cascade of neurotransmitters release that goes out through the autonomic nervous system. And then telling your body to start preparing itself. , , we're talking about the stress response, but we're talking about the adrenaline and cortisol. And basically kicking it into action in order to protect you. And you get signals sent to the adrenal glands, which primarily in stress, when we talk about the stress response, we're talking about adrenaline and cortisol. With adrenaline being kind of the first immediate hormone that is produced and starts making physiologic changes to your body. , speeding up your heart rate, constricting certain blood vessels while dilating others. really just preparing your body to do something. Preparing you for action to overcome that threat. And then once your body senses that threat is still present and is still there and you need to stay in this mode of action or doing something, that's when the cortisol release starts to happen, which again has all kinds of effects on your body. Similarly, in protection mode, but it's really designed to help you move, help you do something, help you stay in action. when we think about acute stress, we just talk about the stress response.

I can't think of her name now, but the book's called Burnout. It's a great book and I highly recommend it. But they talk through this concept of completing the stress cycle and how, as you just mentioned, just because your body's tired and it's a certain time at night where , you're ready to go to bed physically, it doesn't mean that your insides have completed that stress cycle. And how do you do that. , it's hard, , it's hard to do that.

And I'm happy to talk a little more on that. That's kind of my little golden tool. But then also having ways to complete the cycle. you get home from work and you maybe engage in some physical activity. You get some of that, you kind of let that sympathetic drive finish out. You have some release for it. Maybe you go for a walk or you get outside in nature or you come home and you hug your partner or you hug your kids. Or you call someone and you have an emotional or social connection with someone. Those are things that can kind of trigger the parasympathetic to start turning on and telling your body, , I'm in a safe place. I'm home and I can start settling down. And , sympathetic drive, you can start to turn off now. Totally. And then certainly breathing and things that, that we can talk more about. Ooh, I love it. I love it.

And again, I think that's the first thing that I would encourage them to do is to recognize that you're not alone too. I think it can feel really isolating, especially when you're going through chronic stress. You, you can consciously acknowledge that other people deal with stuff, but it's really hard to see beyond your own stuff when you're really in the thick of things, especially when you're in that really in a state of burnout, you really do feel very isolated and alone. , and then, I think for coaching somebody or advising someone and what I would tell my partners is to recognize and remind yourself that there are things that you can control. When you get to this point of chronic stress or burnout, you may feel you have lost control of everything. And as humans, we to be in control. And reminding ourselves, what can we control. We can control our breath. We can stop, take a pause and we can use our breath to our advantage. We can control our movement. We can choose to move our bodies. We can choose to incorporate functional fitness or physical activity into our day. We can choose. And that's what we put into our body and into our mind. sometimes it doesn't feel that way, but we can control what we're saying to ourselves, our negative self-talk, all of that stuff, our mindset. And I, first and foremost, you have the ability to just pause and then choose your response to any situation. And that's really where that mind body connection comes in and this mindfulness work. And, , again, it's for me, it's probably just starts with taking a pause. I have this, we have this podcast episode that we did on our podcast. It's a, I think it's in our self-awareness episode where I tell the listeners to stop for 30 seconds, no matter what they're doing, even if they're driving, just keep driving, but just stop for 30 seconds and just breathe and just notice what comes up in your body. , that's a typical mindfulness practice, but, and that's a great place to start.",

It's not bad, but that's probably a sign that you might benefit from doing that a little bit more often. , and I, I think that's a great place to start is just stopping, pausing, taking a breath. And then from there you can increase that 30 seconds to a minute or five minutes. And , these breathing practices don't have to look formal meditation or, , , they don't have to happen at a certain time of day. It, it just gives you a moment to stop and then tap into your body and what your mind's doing at that time and, and start building that connection that you can, , you can manipulate it to your advantage. These things happen automatically, we discussed earlier, but you can influence them for sure by things breathing and movement. Absolutely. Absolutely. And it, it makes, , if you look at the kind of the allostatic load, basically the total amount of stress that someone carries the whole day, if instead they go and they get a little activated, something stressful at work, and then they breathe and they slide, slow down. And then you can, , if you're in a really, really, really, really slow down, then they're down here for a little bit and then they maybe climb back up and breathe and slow down and they're down here. But you look at the, this, some amount of stress under that chart, I'm imagining this line graph here in my head. There's a lot lower, less minutes stressed during the day. your body is less stressed out and it gets a chance to process or gets a chance to move some of that cortisol out of your system. And it's a practice. , I mean, you wouldn't go out and expect to hit a home run at the World Series if you've never swung a bat in your life. , and as humans, we tend to be harsh on ourselves.

Hey, I think I'm going to take this spin class tomorrow morning. Oh, sure. Oh, I get it. Message received. this happens super fast, we've got to slow it down. Step one, you assume someone is out to get you. You interpret what they say as an attack. They're threatening your self-worth, your inherent goodness, your character, or your abilities. in this situation, Cam must be thinking, you must think I'm fat. You must think that I'm lazy or that I'm a glutton. You're saying that I'm not attractive. That is rude of you. How dare you. Oh, I get it. Message received. Taking things personally happens when you mind-read what the other person is thinking and you assume that they are attacking you. You feel threatened, in an attempt to create safety, you pull out a lesser-evolved defense mechanism. You try to protect yourself by taking offense. , step two. You try to protect yourself by labeling the other person as jerk and, and labeling yourself as the innocent victim. You're trying to protect your vulnerable ego by simultaneously trying to control them while also blaming them, but without addressing it directly, because that might make you look you're not quite innocent. you add passive aggression on top of that. And that's how you create this lovely vindicating feeling of self-righteousness in the short term. , step three. You try to targeted blank and self-militating victim and one final step in this process is to use your distracting gestures to ultimately resolve a problem that has been prepar teng in a pretty parti- warty way from this idea of self- styles over video game. , step four. Be mindful of that V-act ofateral behavior. which is where you quietly continue your sense of insecurity and isolation, and you feel drama, a constant sense of drama. You continue to overthink the problem. You wonder if you're a bad person, and that the way you're responding is not making things better. And taking things personally is an immature defense mechanism.",

Why would you insult me by telling me how fat I am. But that story came from my American culture, where being fat is shamed and telling people they're fat is an insult. After more time, in Argentina I learned that culturally, commenting on people's changes and appearances isn't an insult. It's a sign of closeness. I had people comment on my weight, my zits, my clothing, my hair, and not in particularly flattering ways. They were just being honest. When my story was, they're insulting me, I felt offended. And when my story was, they're showing me affection, it was no big deal. It was just a way to connect. We make assumptions about what people think all the time. If you've been hurt or mistreated in the past, you're even more likely to take things personally in the present. let's say someone honks at you. The story machine kicks into gear. Do they hate me. Am I a bad driver. No, I'm a great driver. Everyone else is an idiot.",

Usually both people have a part, but we're only responsible for our part. stop trying to passively manipulate the world to stop hurting your feelings and instead get really clear on what you can and can't control. my favorite exercise for this is using a piece of paper, a fine one, dividing it into two parts.

With ADHD, there seems to be a predisposed deficit in an executive function, and this makes it hard to process emotions anxiety. When you feel anxious about all the homework you need to do, poor executive function makes it hard to choose which task is most important, and that makes it hard to remember why school is important, which drains your motivation. You might have a hard time getting started because you have less dopamine than the average person and then you might look at your clock and realize it's 1 a. m and then you pull an All-Nighter and then you have much worse executive function in the morning because executive function is worse when you don't sleep , now you're late to school you can't find your keys because you're slightly more disorganized than the average person, then when you finally get to school because of all this stress and lack of sleep, you actually have a harder time paying attention in class than usual,. Now it feels school is impossible and worried about your grades,. Here comes the anxiety. Now this all stems from difficulty organizing and initiating tasks the day before. It starts with poor executive function, and executive function is generally in this part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex. Now with anxiety, there is perhaps or usually an overactive amygdala or HPA axis. This leads to a heightened fear response. when you perceive that you're in danger, a tiger is chasing you or your friend is going to reject you, your brain doesn't care about making a budget or planning out tomorrow's task list. The brain channels that energy away from the thinking part of the brain into reactive responses running away. It decreases big picture thinking or value-based decision making. then you're going to make choices that avoid problems or situations. you might avoid doing your homework because you're afraid you won't do it perfectly. Or there's another form of avoidance, which is avoiding failure, a big threat, by trying to do your homework perfectly. And all that avoidance fuels the anxiety cycle where your anxiety increases, which increases avoidance, which increases worry, which is another type of avoidance, which impacts your ability to function.",

Or I just suck at this. Why even try. Or no one would ever want to be my friend. Now you can add some helpful thoughts. What would you say to someone else who was thinking that. Write those down.

Impulsivity can fuel ADHD and anxiety. you get upset at work, then you impulsively quit your job, and now you're super anxious about paying rent. To support impulsivity, we need to train ourselves to pause. Take a breath or take a walk. Instead of reacting away. Bite your tongue. Put your hands behind your back. Sometimes it's good to sleep on a problem or set up a new rule that you have to take 48 hours before making a decision. want to break up with your girlfriend or buy something that costs more than 100. Set a timer for 48 hours. These are behavioral strategies that you can practice until you make a habit of them. Another thing you can do is, , just do less stuff. This is one of the best ways. To make yourself disorganized and anxious is to overbook yourself and run around a chicken with its head cut off. Schedule in time every day to slow down and work through feelings and to plan and to look at your calendar and to rest and do self-care. The second way we improve our ability to work through anxiety from an ADHD lens is we strengthen the weak parts of our car. The bicycle brakes need extra support. Or in the case of ADHD, it's usually working memory and impulse control that need extra support. Now, this video cannot begin to touch on all of the different skills to support executive functioning. But let me just list a few. You'll have to do your own research to figure out how to build systems that work for you. But here's some of the things we do. You keep visual reminders around you. For people with ADHD, out of sight is literally out of mind. , if I feel panicky, then it seems impossible to remember that I've gotten through this before and I'll feel better after going for a walk. put up a. reminders on your walls.

They are our present moment direction. We can always choose, if we are lining up with our values here in the present moment, because our values are direction, not a destination. for example, do you regret not having kids in your youth.

It's this whole idea of thinking a lot about your regrets and then never doing anything about them. When you do have the chance in the present moment,. I don't blame him. He was probably still gaining those relationship skills. we all have to do in our life. But this concept of I'm going to think about and talk about all the things that I regret, but not do anything about them. That idea prevented him from being able to connect on a deeper level or form more meaningful relationships. And it's that type of thinking about regrets that's disordered. we take the hammer. We take that emotional energy and you use that energy to do the thing, to ask someone out, to take the trip, to fix a relationship, whatever it is. Identify how you can get out of your comfort zone and live the life you value here in the present moment. If I someone, I'm going to tell them. If I feel to do something nice for someone, I'll do it without second guessing. If I feel the need to speak up, but I might get shut down, I'll speak up anyway.

What do you think he meant by that. The same as I intended to convey to my readers and students, that the vision of a meaning ahead of someone, a meaning in wait for someone to be fulfilled by someone, that this contributes most than anything else under equal circumstances for survival. Meaning is the most important thing in our lives. Certainly, because what I call a will to meaning, the wish to find and to fulfill meaning, is the basic motivation in human beings. , this certainly runs counter to much of the determinist notions that are being bandied around these days, as man is a machine, man is a computer, man is a product of instincts. Man is something a rat in experiments, psychological experiments. Of course, you are. But not only against the -called deterministic concepts of man, but also regarding the motivational theories of certain psychotherapeutic systems. Let's talk for a minute about logotherapy, which arose out of this notion of a search for meaning. Logotherapy is one among other types of psychotherapy, is, we may say, a meaning-centered psychotherapy. In as much particularly as logotherapy sees you, a human being, not predominantly determined, not to say dominated, by the will to pleasure, as you were mentioning, nor by the will to power, along the lines of Adlerian teachings, but basically, fundamentally, by a will to meaning. That is to say, the desire, the impulse, to find, to discover in life, or better to say, in each life situation, concrete life situation, confronting someone, the desire to find a meaning therein and to go on to fulfill it. I was very intrigued. One of the most surprising things I've read recently was that you said that when you talked to European students, only 40 said they had suffered this sort of inner void. I was very intrigued. I was very intrigued. I was very intrigued. I was very intrigued. I was very intrigued. I was very intrigued. And yet, 81 of American students experience the same thing. This was decades ago. We think of it just the opposite.",

But you're trying to get them sort of ready to speak up to, , take a more active position, which is hard with emotionally immature people, because they shut other people down really fast. I mean, some of them are very assertive in the way that they shut people down. Other people shut them down by dismissing them, or acting they're being silly, or, , just disregarding it. But I always, let people know that their job is to just try to set the boundary. It's not their job to guarantee that the other person hears it or respects it. That's another task. But being able to say it is moving yourself out of this kind of enforced passive position that emotionally immature people often put their family members into. , you're supposed to be passive and go along with whatever I think is. But when you start to set boundaries, you are really moving into a much more assertive and active relationship vis-a-vis them. You just can't depend on them to hear you or want to understand.

    "text": "Not if the other person's not listening, , not if they're not wanting to step inside your shoes it doesn't work that way is it is it possible i mean is it possible to have boundaries with people who are this and i guess what do you what do people end up doing is it is it you just have to break things off some people do that although i'm never the one to encourage anybody to move into estrangement because i think there's much good practice that can happen as long as you're having some contact with the people and i see here that there's a lot of good growth that can happen when you're in therapy and you still are in touch with your family or your family and you're still in touch with your family or your family and you're still in touch with your family or your family or your family or your family or your family or your family or your family or your family or your person i'm i think people sometimes get the mistaken idea that i'm all for estrangement i'm not i am if the person's being abused or if there's something about that person that they just can't handle yes there are conditions but my client's the one who's going to decide that not me i'm not pushing one way or the other when you're gonna when you're going to make a boundary or set a boundary i encourage them to think about it in terms of you're not doing something against that person you are only trying to get space for yourself always look at it in terms of space it's not that you're shutting them out or not letting them do something it's you're just trying to get space for living space for yourself and you have to make it very remember how concrete and and specific they are you have to make it something that's pretty simple that doesn't have a lot of explanation i mean you can try to explain it once or twice or 10 times but if they are not interested i said and they're not listening that needs to be a part of the conversation and the conversation needs to be a part of the conversation to be abandoned and it needs to be short and sweet and repeated ad infinitum that this is what i can tolerate or this is what you can do in our house or this is what i want to do about thanksgiving or christmas and then that needs to be repeated many times because remember it's three degrees of the circle they're only focused in on what they want and they really do hang on to that until you have repeatedly set that limit in a very specific kind of way and don't try to give them insight or understanding about the reasons behind it that just confuses them it makes them they have no idea what why you're saying this why you're doing this to them it just works better if you keep it clean and you're not just trying to keep it clean and you're not just trying to keep it clean keep your reactivity down and repeat repeat and then when you feel deceited and bad about how they didn't listen to you that's what you expect that's them it's not a call for you to go passive and give up on yourself it's a call for you to get specific and definite and repetitive with them which are all active coping mechanisms you don't it's not good to give up and when you keep at it in a non-reactive way sooner or later i think a new norm gets set up because you just don't do it and if you say you're not going to do it and you don't do it a new norm eventually gets set up do you think that with specifically talking about emotionally immature people as you're defining them here do you think that they will honor the boundary that's set if you continue to say no i'm doing it this way or whatever i wouldn't call it honoring i think it's a good thing because that's that suggests an empathy or a respect for the other person that i don't think is probably there i think that over time it's it's kind of just think that little kids they don't say oh yes mother i understand that this is important to you and therefore i'm not going to do it anymore they're going to keep trying until they learn that this is important for me and this isn't going to happen and that's what that explains a question for me is do the parents think about what it's ashamed of do the parents get dares the grandparents think about what that means they get no matter how many times i go on about this i'm not winning and then a new norm gets established but it's it's not easy and it's not something that comes don't don't have to get emotionally reactive to it either -huh it's that's tough i mean i think managing the feelings that come up when you're it's that dynamic of one person being just no and i don't get why you don't understand this and the other person's they're having all these feelings and they're i'm trying to reach you i'm trying to reach it was just i'm turning away what's your problem stop stirring the pot or whatever every everything was fine before you're talking you're talking again there's too much words i'm trying to stay in my own head and do what i want and you're kind of this annoying mosquito absolutely yes that's it but i want to amplify one point you said that you don't encourage people to stay in relationships where they're being abused because when i when i interview people about this type of dynamic i often hear some feedback about sort of that there's more concern for the person the emotionally immature person than the person that is affected by their behavior and what i mean why is it for them to act that and that it's not sensitive to the experience of the other person in the in the relationship and i'm not saying i don't think anything in our conversation is that but i just want people to heal here very clearly that you're not neither of us is saying people should or have to stay in a relationship with anyone who's being abusive towards them you don't have to keep trying to set a boundary with someone who's being abusive towards you if you if you don't feel safe and even i mean that's that's a pretty clear-cut situation but there are other situations where i've had people who just can't stand to be around their parent i mean that they've experienced the parent as creepy or they experience the parent as going across boundaries or being intrusive and that's maybe it's not technically abused per se but it's they just don't to be around it and what i will say to people is i will just bring up the fact that they don't have to have a visit now or they don't have to respond now and i kind of leave it at that they can take breaks they can not have contact for a while i had a client once that had a new baby and she was it was everything she could do to keep her sanity with this new baby and her father who's a very was a very disruptive life character and as you may have recognized she was playing everybody around with a big fight she was brewing me up with a deal and yet our child has the wedding she had and she has to make things that simple now and make it that she can stay alive and even when i get

And that's been fun because it's been a way of me just talking to the people who are interested in this whole topic. And we talk a lot about the impact of emotionally immature parents on their adult children and what you can do to address that. it's sort of a, it's a, kind of a talking video book. Where I get to, , talk directly to people about some of the things that they're doing. And it's not just about what we're doing here. It's just about what we're doing here. it's just , what we're doing here. , I know that is, I just recently found out about it. I started, I shared it this week, but I don't know.

Because I think there are a lot of people who, who are raising kids who didn't get what they needed when they were young. And , we all want to do better when we know better. , hopefully it almost all of us want to, or for those of us who do, it's really, it's really valuable what you're putting out into the world.

    "text": "Narcissism is built on a fragile foundation. Beneath the arrogance, beneath the entitlement, is a deep fear of being powerless, unworthy, and insignificant. They've spent their whole lives constructing a false self to cover that up. When you go no contact, you don't just walk away. You pierce through that false self. You strip away the illusion, and for a moment, they are forced to confront the emptiness underneath. That's why silence is powerful. Because silence isn't passive. Silence speaks. Silence says, I no longer participate in your game. And that statement is louder than any confrontation, louder than any argument, louder than any attempt to explain yourself. Arguments still feed them. Explanations still give them control. Silence gives them nothing. And that nothingness is unbearable for them. You might wonder why shock hits hard, but it's not because of the silence. It's because of the silence. It's because of the witness. It's because of the silence. It's because of the witness. Even when they've devalued you or discarded you in the past. After all, narcissists are notorious for acting you don't matter. But the truth is, even when they discard you, they expect you to remain available. They assume you'll wait in the wings, ready to return when they snap their fingers. No contact is the one move they don't anticipate. It breaks the cycle. It takes away their ability to recycle you back into their lives. That's why it shocks them. It violates the unspoken contract they believed they had with you, that you would always be there no matter how badly they treated you. And here's the part that I really want you to hear. That shock is the beginning of your freedom because the moment they feel that jolt of losing control, you begin to reclaim your power. Their shock is evidence that you've broken the pattern. It's proof that you've stepped outside of their narrative and started writing your own. And yes, they will scramble. They will try to test your boundaries. They will use guilt, manipulation, or even rage to pull you back in. But if you hold your silence, if you maintain no contact, that initial shock grows into something even bigger than what you've been able to do. And that's why I want you to hear this. The realization that they can no longer reach you in the way they once did.",

They lose the mirror that reflects back the image they want to believe about themselves. That panic is rooted in emptiness. Narcissists live with a hollow core, and they rely on others to fill it. Your silence doesn't just withhold attention. It exposes that hollow space for what it really is. And here's where it gets manipulative. That panic doesn't stay hidden for long. It drives them to act. They'll reach for whatever strategies they've used in the past to pull you back into orbit. Maybe it's a late night message, or maybe it's a long night message. But it's a long night message. Something vague enough to make you wonder if you should respond. Maybe it's a fabricated crisis. A sudden emergency where only you can help. Or maybe it's the flying monkeys, those mutual acquaintances they send to check in. On you, who conveniently deliver their version of the story. These aren't random moves. They're desperate attempts to regain the connection to re-establish the threat of control. But the irony is, the more desperate they become, the clearer it is that they were never in control to begin with. If they truly had the power, they wanted you to believe they had, your silence wouldn't rattle them. Yet here they are, scrambling, scheming, panicking. Because the one thing they can't handle is being ignored. And that's when you start to see the truth, all of their dominance, all of their arrogance, was built on your willingness to engage. This is where psychology intersects with philosophy. Because the panic a narcissist feels is not really about you. It's about them. It's about their terror of being irrelevant. For most people, being unseen or unheard is uncomfortable. For a narcissist, it's unbearable. Their entire identity hinges on the idea that they matter more than everyone else. And that's why they're arrogant. They're arrogant. They're arrogant. They're arrogant. They're arrogant. They're arrogant. They're arrogant. They're arrogant. They're arrogant. They're arrogant. when your silence suggests otherwise, it shakes the foundation of their existence. That's why their panic can look obsessive.

This back and forth, this cycle of contradictory behavior is not a reflection of your inconsistency. It's a reflection of theirs. And that inconsistency is a direct result of your self-reliance. The more you do this, the more you're able to get rid of it. It's not a reflection of your inconsistency. result of your boundary holding firm. What's critical here is that you don't mistake their anger for power or their denial for indifference. When they lash out, it may look strength. When they pretend they don't care, it may look confidence. But in reality, both reactions are masks. The truth is that they're shaken. They're unsettled. They're spinning in circles because your silence has created a problem they can't solve in the usual ways. And that's exactly why your boundary matters much. Because it forces them to deal with themselves instead of projecting everything onto you. And let's be honest, this part of the process is uncomfortable. Knowing that someone is out there raging, lying, denying, spinning stories about you. It can tempt you to break your silence just to determine whether or not you're going to be able to solve the problem. You can't defend yourself just to set the record straight. But here's the deeper truth. The moment you respond, you give them exactly what they want, your attention. And when you stay silent, you do something far more powerful. You let their anger expose them. You let their denial collapse under its own weight. And you stand in the quiet confidence of someone who no longer needs to prove anything. That's the ultimate test. And that's the ultimate test. And that's the ultimate test in this stage. Trusting that their cycle of anger and denial has nothing to do with your worth and everything to do with their inability to handle your boundary. Their fury is not proof that you've wronged them. It's proof that you've finally done something for yourself. And that's why this phase, as messy and loud as it can be, is actually another sign of your freedom taking root. Because while they're caught in that exhausting loop of rage and denial, you're not. You're building something different. Peace, stability, clarity.

These include manipulative, difficult, untreatable, and attention-seeking. Let me type. In this video, we're going to focus on attention-seeking behaviors, but also the paradox that a disorder that seeks and benefits from appropriate attention-seeking shouldn't get it,. That there's those who hold that idea, that perspective, oh, , they just want attention. But many folks with BPD need appropriate attention, and a lot of times they don't know how to get it. And there is this odd belief, , that if you withhold the attention, , or if you ignore them or freeze them out, that will somehow teach. Them to not engage in attention-seeking maladaptive behaviors. That is a complete fallacy. That just isn't the case. And in this video, we're going to talk about BPD and attention, specifically attention-seeking behaviors. please, , and let's get on with it. Here we go. Now, maladaptive attention-seeking behaviors can include, now this list isn't exhaustive, of course,. But it can include. It can include saying provocative or rude things to elicit a reaction, even a negative or hostile one, purposely annoying others or starting fights, exhibiting learned helplessness, which is saying that you can't do something or carry out a task to change a negative situation, but you do have the ability to do. And in other words, often posting one's troubles on social media and embellishing the severity. Self-harming. Direction. Hopeless. Coerced. Suspicion. Oriental.

Some Patricia overcome young for a pig age to sealed options. will teach them to not engage in behaviors to get attention. This just doesn't make sense and it doesn't work. All human beings need some form of attention and some degree of attention. And when they're starved, individuals act out BPD or not. Now, this is not to say that all attention-seeking behaviors should be attended to. , that's not what I'm saying. But if someone with BPD who engages in attention-seeking behaviors, ostracizing them is not going to help the issue. It will inflame it.",

That inner critic. And it will encourage maladaptive beliefs, behaviors, and patterns. And that is not what you want to do. You have to engage in an adaptive and suitable manner, which will sometimes be very difficult,. I mean, that's the truth,. It's not always going to be easy, but it can be really effective. the question becomes, , what can you do about it to help someone who has BPD and how can they benefit from and learn more. Adaptive seeking behaviors, because that's what we want to do,. We want to change those maladaptive attention seeking behaviors into adaptive ones. We don't want to starve them out of attention. That doesn't make any sense. That's just not going to work. we have to change the maladaptive to adaptive. And I can tell you, , in my 20 years plus of doing this, that it does take time.

You have to be aware of your current feelings and in process situation. That's step one. Step two, talk to the person with BPD and explain that you care about them. All.

It just means that your life has multiple domains. That's all of ours,. You have other areas other than this person that has to be dealt with. And that can be really hard for folks with DPD. And I recognize that this is going to be challenging and a sensitive conversation for some. But that's why reassurance that this does not mean abandonment is really important. Also, you don't want to have this conversation when they're showing up at guys or girls night or when they're blowing your phone up or anything that. You want to strike when the iron's cold. That means when all seems calm, , everything seems kind of chill, that's when you want to have conversations about this. Recognize that if they do have some of those classic core content symptoms and issues, which is abandonment, emptiness, some of those are going to get triggered. That's why that reassurance is important. And also, you have to be in a spot or in a place where you're comfortable dealing with that, , and helping them get through it.

Now, the important thing, though, is to provide something that is routine and dependable that fits into your schedule as theirs. Now, this may seem a lot of contacts throughout the day, but these short contacts help reassure the other person that you're still present. And it decreases the likelihood of them acting out in those attention-seeking behaviors. It also. It also allows you time to focus on other parts of your life that you need to. And it doesn't mean you love them any less. It doesn't mean you care about them any less. This doesn't mean that they're not important to you. It just means that you only have much attention to give out and managing it to address all aspects of your life allows you to be more attentive and helpful, but also helps you take care of yourself, too. And that's critical. If we don't help ourselves, we can't help anyone else. And it's important. It's important that we do that. Now, over time, you'll find that reassurance sets in. The routine provides a sense of stability. Stability gives the person with BPD a feeling of safety and connection. And this is one of the best tools to help them manage their BPD beliefs, behaviors, and patterns. , it's going to take time,. Just when you pour concrete. It takes a while for that concrete to solidify. It's the same thing with predictability and safety, particularly for those with BPD. And fourth and last, if it is not an emergency and define what an emergency is with that other person, they need to wait until the scheduled contact. Now, this is where it can get really tricky,. This is where it can get tough. And this is why therapy is important for those with BPD to learn those adaptive strategies, to not engage in maladaptive behaviors, such as attention-seeking behaviors, and also exercise containment. Containment is critical to controlling BPD maladaptive beliefs, behaviors, and patterns. And it really, really is. I hope that you found this video helpful. Please leave any comments about how you manage attention-seeking behaviors. And that would be great because that helps a lot of folks.",

That's what he talks about it sometimes. Some days you get a couple and some days you just, you don't even know you're in it. as a person grows in healing, let's say you would get triggered and you start spiraling but you've got enough self-awareness you'd catch yourself. And you, I know what's going on here. Then you ground yourself, you regulate your emotions and you get back to your cortex and you go, hey, I'm believing lies there. I'm not that useless person. And you don't have to do that. And you get, and what you find is all of a sudden that spiral just stopped. instead of being in it for four days, you're now only in it for 15 minutes and you caught yourself. Now there's going to be a bit of a hangover effect as you kind of keep working through emotions with it. But within a day, you're back to being in a pretty good place and you've grown a little bit. And then because of that, you probably won't get triggered as intensely in that area. Again, because you've grown that next time something happens, the trigger won't be intense and it won't be as frequent. And over time, you're growing with greater infrequency and less intensity until you don't get triggered there anymore. But that can take a few years. But it can happen. It can happen. Wow. It's really, it's really possible. It is. Man. Do you get a lot of people who are, feel at their other side. Do you get a lot of people who are at their wits end.

I am no gangster, but I would have found a way to kill this man. Thankfully, my daughter, point blank, asked me to be her daddy and not her avenger. The opening words from a favorite novel of mine, The Salt Eaters, by Tony Cade Bambara, welled up within me and demanded an answer. Are you sure, sweetheart, that you want to be. How could I be and still be a man if I didn't go to war with a foul individual who had hurt my daughter. Arunike's insistence that I walk with her, that I follow her lead, was my key to answering that question. I recognized that despite my own innate desire to be protected and safe, I didn't want either one of my parents to go to jail. I knew there would be no personal satisfaction or gratification if they were incarcerated for punishing my cause. I knew that I was a criminal stepfather. I'm thankful they listened to me. I didn't have a plan of action for my stepfather, but I had a plan for my family. I'm grateful my father turned towards me and respected my request to stand down. And to this day, he has allowed me to continue to lead the charge to our healing. He showed more strength and restraint compared to his natural instinct to destroy my stepfather. Listen, many men, I had absorbed the lessons that I must protect my honor at all costs. From other men, from the movies, from locker rooms, from the very culture of American manhood, I was taught that her sexual assault is all about me. That her sexual purity is directly connected to what it means for me to be a man, a good father, a protector. But when I actually listened to my daughter, it was clear, I knew revenge would just worsen the situation.",

It's probably helpful in your intimate relationships to make people aware of this, to let your partner or your closest friends know, Hey, sometimes I freeze up in the moment. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. And I'll tell you I'm fine with something and later realize that I actually had another underlying want that I wasn't conscious of at the time. Is it with you if I come to you later on and just fill you in on what I wanted, even if it's too late for me to get that, just you're aware of what my underlying wants and needs tend to be. And the more comfortable you can get doing this, the more likely you are to start actually deactivating your own fawn response around that person,. If you have a pattern of going to them and having the things you want and need to be accepted, even if it's later on after the fact, your body might start logging. Oh, this person actually does listen to me when I bring up what I want or need. And now maybe in the moment, eventually after enough repetition, my body can start calming down, not having that fawn response come online. And I can learn to access my own emotional state in that instance and communicate it at the time. But again, this is a process,. And you might find there are situations where you go to someone after the fact, let them know what was happening and they're not receptive to that, or they kind of your fawn response,. And that in and of itself is information about that maybe not being the safest or most healthy relationship for you to be in. Doesn't mean you have to do anything about it. It's just information.",

And then the tectonic plates of your life are going to shift as they always do and at some point you will find yourself back in a period where you are just trying to keep your head above water.

And the way that I've come to think about it is that those survival periods are my opportunities to practice deep humility. No matter how much work I do in my life I don't ever want to believe that I am above struggling. whenever I find myself in that state of survival I'm in a state of resisting something difficult that I'm going through which happens frequently. I do not go down without a fight. I try to reframe it as it is my time to be taught. It is my time to humble myself and let life teach me whatever lesson I currently need to learn.",

Because this is the kind of thing that is actually going to help you get in reality and start learning from your mistakes and taking more chances instead of just doubling down and inhibiting based on a fear of retribution. Which blends pretty naturally into the fourth thing that if you had complex PTSD growing up you probably did not internalize but it would have been wonderful if you had. Which is that it is normal to not know things that you have never been taught. And it is also normal to not know things that you have been taught but that you were dissociated while they were taught. And that's what I want you to do. And I want you to do that. And I want you to do that. And I want you to do that. And I want you to do that. And I want you to do that. And I want you to do that. Because if you are in a state of low or high grade dissociation you are by definition not forming memories properly. And a lot of people with complex PTSD spent a great deal of their early years intermittently dissociated. And then we can develop all of these areas of deep shame where there are basic life lessons that other people learned really early on and that we know we were technically taught as but that for whatever reason we can't seem to remember enough or keep our focus on those areas. And we feel embarrassed as adults about all of these kind of knowledge and skill gaps that we might have. But it is a perfectly normal thing to not be able to remember and internalize information that our whole selves were not online for during the learning process. Because the learning process requires us to be both emotionally and intellectually present. And the thing is when we grow up with many of these knowledge and skill gaps we often start to internalize a deep sense of shame around everything that we don't know. And we often don't even stop to check in and go have I ever learned this thing.",

What kind of shocked me in, and is that there is a theory of development, moral development by Kohlberg that was put out years ago, where it describes how we develop a sense of conscience. And it starts out by, we first discover that when you do something wrong, there's a punitive reaction. And , you don't want to get hurt. , you don't do bad things. And then we hopefully will grow eventually to a place where we do things for the integrity of it, for the principle of it. , help me understand what do you think is happening in men's development, that's causing them to stay basically at the lowest rung of moral development when it comes to their relationship with women.

I keep getting all the benefits I want from sexism in general, from battery. And these poor women, anytime they go out for help, when the first things they hear, what were you doing.

And the domestic abuse intervention programs in Duluth, Minnesota, has all the kinds of materials that's needed to develop this kind of intervention, because it's a community intervention. And what will happen is the guys who don't want to change you just start moving to different community, and they're going to be more vulnerable.

In the moments you recognize manipulation for what it is and choose not to engage. Reclaiming your power isn't loud. It's calm. It's deliberate.

You lived in a constant state of reaction. But now something shifts. You don't answer the phone. You don't reply to the guilt ridden message. You don't chase the closure they're dangling bait. You realize that peace matters more than being understood by someone who distorted your every word. That's power. It's not in what you say but in what you no longer feel the need to respond to. At first it feels strange. you're doing something wrong. Because for long your focus was survival. You can't change it. You kept the peace by keeping quiet. You made yourself small to avoid being criticized. You twisted yourself into someone they could tolerate. Hoping maybe they'd finally treat you. You made yourself small to avoid being criticized.

And then I went to the last state mental hospital in Boston, which was also interesting. It was a sanctuary for very disturbed people. And that institution gets closed. I go work at the Veterans Administration Hospital. I met these guys who were people who I looked up to. They were good athletes, competent people, helicopter pilots all my age. And these guys had broken apart. And they had fallen apart. And I go, oh. And they reminded me of some of my relatives who I grew up with, who also had been concentration camp survivors and Japanese camp survivors. And then I learned much else after that.

You said earlier that you were born in 1943. 1943, very important. When you're born has a huge impact on who you become. my earliest imprint is of my father at some point was detained by the Germans. He was not in concentration camp, but he was supposed to go off there. My mom is by herself, raising small kids in hiding next to the place where the Nazis are launching their rockets to go to London. half of the rockets fell into our backyard. And I have no conscious imprint of that. But I grew up a kid growing up in Ukraine today. And a lot of kids my age died.",

Every single conversation I have here on The Diary of a CEO, at the very end of it, you'll know, I asked the guest to leave a question, in The Diary of a CEO. And what we've done is we've turned every single question written in The Diary of a CEO into these conversation cards that you can play at home. you've got every guest we've ever had, their question, and on the back of it, if you scan that QR code, you get to watch the person who answered that question. We're finally revealing all of the questions and the people that answered the question. The brand new question. The brand new version two updated conversation cards are out now at theconversationcards. com. They've sold out twice instantaneously. if you are interested in getting hold of some limited edition conversation cards, I really, really recommend acting quickly. I'm a little busy, but it's really worth it. if you are interested, you can get hold of a few more of these cards. But if you're not interested, you can get hold of a few more of these cards. And I'll see you guys in a couple of weeks. Take care. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.",

Your authentic self is about who. Me, me, me, me, me. Everything is what's happening to me. What's in it for me. Do that you impact other people. You affect other people's lives. You make the work environment easier or more taxing. Can someone learn to be a better self-regulator of their emotions. I've been around former SEALs, U. S. Secret Service, presidents, and I learned a lot about communication, reading people, confidence. And I'll share these things. first of all, Ebi Pompouros is the former U. S. Secret Service agent. From guarding presidents to reading liars, she now reveals the strategies she used to make anyone respect you, trust you, and give you what you want. I've been around very confident people, and they had a really good circle around them, inner circle. Because if you're exposing yourself to people and environments that are not good for you, that will actually impact your life negatively. , I always say, be careful who you try to save. Some people will drown you. And then the other thing I would see presidents do is they were very good at delegating. they didn't need to know everything, because confident people are with not knowing all the information. your brain is a bathtub. The bathtub can only hold much water. If you keep putting water in the bathtub, it's going to overflow. That's your cognitive load. My bathtub only holds the water it needs to hold in. And another thing that the Secret Service taught us is that it's really important to use your hands. Because when people don't see hands, it's a sign of untrustworthiness. , you can't trust them. when you see hands, open hands, I'm no threat. And then there's communication skills, manipulation tactics, and a strategy to make good decisions. And I will go through them. But the two most important things are. To my regular listeners, I know you don't it when I ask you to subscribe at the start of these conversations. I don't saying it. I don't it being in there. None of us it. It's frustrating. Do what's also frustrating.",

My goal was always, no, you have the ability. I might need to kind of shift things around or shake things up a little bit in your mindset. But in the end, you are very capable. And most people are.

I'm going to add more stuff and more stuff and more stuff. Your cognitive load is overflowing. It's maxed. You're inefficient. You're sloppy. You're not getting things done. If you are, you're just barely getting there. You're everywhere. You're stressed out. You're frazzled. Because you're maxed out. You're beyond maxed out. everything I do, and I will tell you, I learned this from watching Presidents, I keep my load light. My bathtub only holds the water it needs to hold in. it protects you from overextending yourself, stressing yourself, and it also keeps you from making bad decisions. You make good decisions. There's something called decision fatigue, where the more stuff I add, we think the busier I am, the better I am. I'm moving. I'm hustling. I'm doing all this stuff. Look how maxed out I am. Just because you're busy, it doesn't mean you're being perfect. You're not productive. Those two things are not synonymous. often people think leaders keep adding, adding. No, what good leaders do. And this is what, again, I've learned. They take out of that bathtub. They take out. What can I do less of I can be exceptional at the other things I do. Really great example. This is public knowledge I can share it. President Barack Obama, he had 30 of the same suits. Why. Why do you think. 30 of the same exact suits. he didn't have to make many decisions every day. He didn't want to sit and figure out what he's going to wear. It's a decision he didn't have to make. That keeps his bathtub light. Think about all the decisions he had to make every single day. I want a light bathtub. Boop. Take that thing out. Lighten your bathtub. when you're overthinking and overanalyzing and trying to process all this stuff, you are maxing out that bathtub. how can you perform. You don't have infinite resources. You do not have an infinite cognitive load and you do not have an infinite emotional load. Don't keep adding. Your job is to take out that the things you do, you do exceptionally and you're much more emotionally stable.",

I was doing everything the book said, and I still wasn't getting the results in terms of a romantic context. It was these women could just figure out at some deeper level that I wasn't it.

But it taught me over time that actually you should aim at real confidence. And the real confidence came when the story in my head about myself was that I was of high value. And I'll share a story. the reason I said this to my friend literally two weeks ago was because he was dating someone and she turned around to him. She's a very young girl. He's 30, five. She was 25. She turned around and said, what. I don't think I want to have kids. They'd known each other four months. And his response to that was really, really insecure. It was , I really want to have kids. I want to have kids. And she ended up dumping him a week later. And I remember I said to him, do , my current girlfriend said the same to me when I was 30. She turned around to me and said, I'm not sure if I want to have kids. And in my head, the first thought that came in was, if I'm being completely honest, was I'm not sure I want to have kids with you yet either. You're still a young girl. I'm not sure I want to have kids with you. You're still on trial. I'm still dating you to figure out if you're the person. my response, even though I didn't say anything out loud, because I just kind of shoulder rolled it, was because I valued myself, my immediate response wasn't to be insecure.

I said, babe, at any time when you feel you want to go back to Bali, you go and I'll help you. I'll help you go back to Bali. You don't have to be in London. You go wherever makes you happy.

Getting a confession I can find out what happened that investigators could figure out what to do this little girl wouldn't be victimized again. That's what I mean by your authentic self. Don't come in and be phony. Nobody wants a phony. But authentic self has become me, me, me, me, me. Everybody check me out. It's me, me, me. I was irrelevant personally. It was what I was contributing. What was my goal. My task. That's what I mean by authentic self. when you show up to work, wherever you work, what are you bringing to bring value. To the whole team. Because your authentic self could be I'm bringing my problems, I'm bringing my opinions, I'm bringing my judgments. Honestly, nobody cares. I have lots of different leaders across my different companies. And when I look at the best leaders, one of the things they have in common is you do feel they are being honest with you. Are they bringing their full authentic self and all their baggage to work. No, but you feel you're dealing with the honest self. And I think some of the worst leaders, the ones that really, really struggle, you can see that the team that they're leading just feel maybe they're manipulating them a little bit, or they're not being straight with them, or there's something going on. They're acting. You can kind of feel it. I'm wondering how this kind of sits with everything you've just said there, because you're going into these interrogations and you're winning them over to some degree because you're building trust. You're building trust, but you're not acting. That's a different thing. I'm not being disingenuous. How do you square all of that. Are you acting. You're not acting. I'm listening. Because I'm not there for me. And I'm not there to pass judgment. The quickest way to shut people down, even in business, you want to know what's going on around you all the time. If people are too afraid to say things or don't tell Steven, oh, you don't know how he's going to react, or he's going to get mad, he's this. That's a problem. The problem is they're going to be too afraid to tell you things.",

You're collecting intelligence because when you have the intelligence, then you can make the decisions. But you must know what's going on around you. when you pass judgment and you're telling everybody your opinion, and you're bringing your authentic self, people filter information because they're bringing versions of themselves that they think you want to hear. We don't want that. I was very neutral. I'm a neutral slate. Even to this day, I try to be neutral in that. I allow people to come to me, and people are very open and they share, and it works for me because I get a good read on people and situations I can make good decisions. But I don't do a lot of the talking. A good interviewer doesn't say anything. Good interviewer says less. Don't make it about you. Don't try to guess where people headspace is. Ask them.

To be effective when you're dealing with these monstrous people that you dealt with, whether it's terrorists or people that hurt children or whoever else it might be, you're not going to be able to do that. You're not going to be able to do that. Did you have to kind of step outside of. Do you have to detach at some deeper level. And do you have to see everybody as just a human being. Because I'm wondering how you navigate these spaces when these people have done horrific things. Did you teach yourself to just be more empathetic, dare I say. You could be empathetic. all different crimes have different types of characteristics. somebody who's a terrorist, let's say, that's more of an ideology. And they were typically raised from being very young to feel a certain way. I understood coming into a room that I'm dealing with someone who's been groomed from a very young age to see the world a certain way. that's why I did not bother wasting my time trying to change that person's viewpoint. But what about that kid that hurt that little girl. with him, that specific one, I spent a lot of time speaking to him. And I did bring empathy. empathy does not mean I agree with you, I'm trying to understand you. And what turned out with him is that he had been sexually abusedhimselfwhen he was young. And all that stuff came out. And it did not excuse his behavior or what he did, but it was genuine. I was genuinely curious. I was genuinely asking him. And at the same time, I needed to find out the truth. Sometimes I would have somebody across from me, and I'm thinking they did it. And Then. And afterward, I'm , they didn't do it. There's times where you clear people, and that's really important. that's why when you would, at least when you talk to people, and even to this day, we're all biased, but I try not to come in and project that. I really try to give people a fair chance to show me what's happening instead of coming in with prejudgments. And you're better at reading their behavior too when you're talking to people.",

And they tend to think because they're better communicators. They have less complaints. Because when you're a cop, you're going to get a complaint. There's no way. You're going to get them. You're going to just get them. But women tend to have less. Female officers. Female officers tend to have less complaints. And they think that they're just better at dialoguing and de-escalating. On this point about confidence, then, you said it didn't sound my friend had a confidence issue. Do you think confidence is the thing that the people who do feel they're not respected in the world need to be aiming at. And in your experience, what can one do to build their confidence. Let me say this first. I've been around very steady people, confident people, I suppose. I've never seen anyone. Or heard anybody talk about it. Ever. I've never heard anybody in the circle of where I was, whether it's former SEALs, US Secret Service, the. I've never had anyone talk about it. And I think one of the secrets is they don't talk about it. They don't think about it. They don't give it that much life. They just. I just am. I just are. I think that's one secret where people try to. They think about it much. And I think it goes back to what we're saying initially. , stop over analyzing. Just be you. Just do. But now if you're looking at confident people with things that I noticed traits amongst confident people or steady people, they have a strong. They have a good circle around them, meaning they're very aware and meticulous of who's around them and who they associate with. Because if you're not. If you're around insecure people, it bleeds on you. , you're going to absorb what other people are. And if you're the most confident person in the room, it's probably not a good thing. It's not a good thing. You want to be around people you learn from. It can't just be you're at the top and everybody's looking to you. Your bathtub's going to crack, number one. The other thing I learned about confidence, research shows people in law enforcement are perceived to be highly confident.",

Should I pull out the pepper spray. I mean, what would you do in this moment. You'd be dead. when you're used to making decisions, whether or wrong, but when you're used to making those decisions and believing in yourself and trusting in yourself that you're making the best decision you can with the information you have at that moment, that builds confidence.

Worry about simple things. Show up on time. I was reading this study about confidence and the victim mindset. It was a study done by YouGov in 2025 in the United States. And it said women rated themselves much higher on trustworthiness, honesty, and empathy. But men rated themselves higher on self-awareness, sense of humor, and confidence. And the gap between self-reported confidence between men and women was quite significant. It's about 50 of men consider themselves confident, where it's only about 35 of women that consider themselves confident. I'll tell you this. I've never heard anybody from the field of work I came from say, I feel I'm an imposter. that whole imposter syndrome. I've never heard that. Again, I didn't hear it till after I left the service. It's wild. Because all these things. I had no awareness. I had no awareness of them because they were never discussed in the circle that we were in. I also think sometimes when we sit and discuss these things to such extent that they actually start to plant seeds of doubt. I'm not saying we shouldn't study and have self-awareness, but I think when we over-evaluate to such a degree, we never did that.",

I started trying to figure out how to make the idea happen, which looked three months on Google scrolling down, searching the word web developer, clicking onto people's links, and then emailing them saying, hey, can you build websites. it was this long, drawn-out process of stumbling forward. And had I known, I think a lot of entrepreneurs and founders say this, had I known what it would have taken, had I known how difficult it was, had I not been ignorant and naive, maybe I would have been demotivated or demoralized to do it.

He said, procrastination is the avoidance of psychological discomfort. when you have that big essay to do, what you end up doing is taking the path of least resistance, which might be, I'll just clean the house.

It goes back to a lot of the stuff that we're saying that sometimes over analyzing and trying to make sense of things does you a disservice. Where sometimes if you just let things be and you just move forward to try to execute, the goal is to execute and do. Because if you sit and try to analyze everything, how should this be done or that be done. Or if you look at the bigger picture of what it's going to be , it can kill you.

Executing and making progress. Progress no matter how small is progress. As long as you're moving in that direction. But thinking about something, ruminating over something, playing that CD over and over again, procrastinating, just start. Just go. I spoke to Sir David Brailsford, who's the guy that turned the British cycling team around. And he told me that when he went in there and those players, those cyclists were down and out and depressed and winning nothing, one of the first things he did was ban them from thinking about the podium. And I always, I came up with this phrase called pedals over podium, based on everything he said to me, which is he got his riders to think about the pedals in front of him, just the rotation of the pedals and not whether they were cycling fast enough to win the gold or needed to speed up. And he said to me when he did that, it was almost the riders would get to the end of the track and they would get off the bike and they could not recall the cycle because they were present.",

them on outside then the day after that he took the shoes and just went to the corner and then came back and then he went from being severely obese and having being very unhealthy to running marathons and that's how he did it you've seen some of the most consequential people ever make decisions these presidents maybe you can't answer this question i don't know if you can but who were the best decision makers and why that you observed i'm going to say this to be the president of united states it's no small thing for you to get to that place you are exceptional i just i say this in a neutral way people get very personal or biased and i don't just because i served under various presidencies didn't matter what the party was and i learned much from all of them but as far as making decisions there are a couple of things one they had a really good circle around them inner circle everybody didn't have access to the president there were layers around the president everybody didn't have access to them that was really important but the circle around them was a circle that was there to support them everybody was there to support them everybody was there to support them everybody was there to support them around them was steady i never saw i never saw anybody go cry at the white house i never saw anybody lose their mind i never saw anybody get emotionally dysregulated i never saw this and that was important because that kept them steady the other thing was they were very good at delegating they didn't need to know everything but they would find people who knew more than they did to give them advisement to help make decisions and they would just make decisions the other thing i saw and i witnessed they worked very hard they worked i would see presidents sit up i mean i think it's to say this i really don't talk about the people i protected out of out of respect there's a greek saying everybody loves the everybody loves the treason nobody loves a traitor and i'm just always careful not to say but i would see presidents i remember president bill clinton he'd be up till very late hours of the night studying reading preparing just reading better than barack obama i mean i'd work midnight shifts sometimes and he was up studying sitting at his desk reading preparing they would study they would spend time studying all those things collectively help you feel i'm as informed as i can be by studying myself by surrounding myself with people who are informing me who are also steady and then i make the best decisions i can with the mom the information i have in front of me now one of the things we do and we all do this we do a disservice to us when things don't go or work out the way we thought they would we beat up on ourselves i should have known this i should have this i should have that and anytime i start to do that or i have somebody and i always say i'm my husband used to say this too he's you made the best decision you could with what you knew in that moment don't go back and make yourself feel because you feel you should have chose differently i've heard obama say that just i said it pretty much close he i heard him talk about this whole idea of a making decisions at 51 certainty when he spoke at this conference i was speaking at in sao paulo a couple years ago and he's talking about the big decisions in his career going in and getting osama bin laden didn't have 100 certainty and he said sometimes in life you have to make a decision with the information you have and be at peace with the fact that you made the best available decision with the information you had and move on confident people are with not knowing all the information they're i don't need to know it doesn't have to be 100 because and here's the other thing because we're scared of making the wrong decision and unless you're the president of the united states or and you're in law enforcement and you may shoot the wrong human being which i get but overall most decisions not life or death make a decision and then feel with it being wrong if you're insecure that you're terrified you're going to make the wrong decision why because you're going to look dumb you're going to feel dumb confidence you don't care how you look or how you eat you're not sick and you're not quantifying he's going to think i'm done she's going to think i look stupid they're going to think this and even for yourself you don't tally that you're with making the wrong decision it's i'm going to make my choice i hope it's the one i did the best i could but i'm comfortable with that but if you're worried about it's the wrong decision then don't make one and that's that in and of itself that the confident people don't do that the other thing i would see presidents do they had time to themselves meaning you would see them they would have time where they would be alone and they would think they won't they weren't always exposed or surrounded by people george w bush he would go to waco to the ranch that was his roots that was his place to i need to kind of find my roots person barack obama i spent every holiday in hawaii he went home george bush senior he would split his time between kenny bunkport and texas houston that was another thing they'd all go home they'd all go home i hear from a lot of very successful people that i interview that they all have some kind of meditation practice and even when i looked at the life of someone steve jobs and how he was able to continually see round corners and remove the keyboard and remove the stylus then remove the iphone jack and remove java from our phones and do all of these things that the time were crazy talk that's someone who was motivated to do something that was not his own and that's why he was able to do it and he was able to do it because he was motivated by money today would not have done but someone that could see the future tomorrow could have done and you come to learn that he was basically a yogic he was he was a meditator and what you described there made me think of that which is all these successful people seem to be have some kind of practice where they get out of the trenches and into their intuition or into the clouds alone they have space to stand back from the painting they can see the full picture do what they were all also do.",

You also want to give people time to absorb what you're saying, to feel what you're saying. When you slow down also as a presenter, I am less likely to make mistakes. I am less slightly, less likely to say the wrong thing live on camera. When I do the news, I'm less likely to do these things. And I'm more likely to able to think process and share. And you're. How many times do people do presentations. And when I do communication for companies, I always tell them when you're doing your presentations, please don't do this. All , guys, just one other thing. Let me put this in here. I don't want to waste anybody's more time or take up any more time. Just really quickly. What did I just do. I just told you what I'm about to tell you really isn't that important. don't even listen. Why do we do that. I'm here. I'm speaking.

I'm going to pause. I'm going to speak. I'm going to share. But if I'm talking for myself, because I'm insecure, I want people to see me. Everybody needs to know you're sitting at that table,. Make yourself known. Make sure they can hear you. Make sure they see you at that meeting. You just made that about you. You shouldn't be at that table. That's the difference. Command your voice. Also, science and research, because I know you science and research, the more we speak, meaning if we talk a lot and we use a lot of words and we don't get to the point, we are seen as less trustworthy. And people will assess how competent and confident you are in the way you speak. Get to the point. Say it with less words. And be impactful. Command what you say.

When I first began doing the news, which I knew nothing about, again, I went from a job where you were supposed to be not in front of the camera, actually out of the camera, because the camera is supposed to catch the president, never you, to being in front of the camera. And the producer I worked with the very first day said, let me give you a secret. When you're on camera, just , the camera sucks 25 of your energy away. It takes immediately 25 of your energy out. when the person is watching, you look flatter. You ever watch Zooms.

    "text": "One of the things I learned from watching MrBeast make content, but also from doing this podcast and sitting with guests that get really high retention. Cause the audience don't know this, but when every guest comes on the show, we get a graph back from YouTube and the other places that the podcast appears that shows how many minutes people listened for. And sometimes there's big swings. Between the lowest performing guest and the highest performing guests on YouTube, there's a 100 gain in retention. thinking back over the last month, the lowest performing guests on the Diary of a CEO in terms of how long people listened for is let's say, just get arbitrary number. People listened for one hour. The highest performing, they listened for two hours. And that's the range that we see. And when I look at why that is, it's often because it's why it's always because of the way that they speak. You're one of the people that has extremely high retention because of the way that you speak. And Morgan Housel is another one. And I was watching Morgan Housel, the way he delivers his message. And he basically always starts it with a curiosity gap or a promise. And MrBeast does the same. MrBeast's videos don't start with, hey, hi, I'm MrBeast. I'm MrBeast. Welcome back to my channel. He immediately shouts a promise in your face, which is , I've put a thousand people in that circle. The last one to leave wins 5 million. And immediately there's this curiosity gap. I want to see the answer. And I just noticed that in great speakers, even on stage when I go to conferences, is they leave me hanging on something that they haven't yet given me. Somebody once, when I began doing keynotes or speaking, there was this other speaker and he said to me, he's , let me give you some advice, kid. And I was , sure, I'll take it. I didn't mind. And he hadn't heard me speak yet. It was just, he was just trying to impart wisdom. He said, just because you're an expert doesn't mean you're interesting. And it always stuck with me.

It's about being able to relay that information in a way that people can understand and that's digestible. It's how they process information. Do , I even learned to do that in the interview room when I would Mirandize people. I was trying to assess where they were linguistically. And I could speak to them in a way that resonated with them. one of the things I would do is I had Miranda. I never read Miranda. I never read Miranda verbally. The Miranda in the United States before you interview anybody. And I would do this, whether they were an applicant, a suspect, a victim, because you never knew how things were going to go. I would Mirandize everybody. , you have the to remain silent, all that. I had a piece of paper and I would hand it to them and I would say, please read each sentence out loud. the first sentence would be, and I would have them hold it. They would read out loud, I have the to remain silent. And I would ask them, do you understand that. I wouldn't read it. I would say it. I would listen to them. And I wanted to hear their speech, how they, , how, how it resonated, their language skills. And they would sign it. Then we'd finish it. And then I would ask them questions that I already knew the answer to. What's your name. What's your date of birth. Where are you from. I had all of this. I did not need it, but it was a way for me to assess their speech. And then based on that, I would meet them where they were. I'm not going to speak the way I normally speak. I'm going to adapt my speech. There's adaptability in a way that's going to resonate with you the most. using big, hefty words, speaking super fast, especially I'm from New York.

the situation makes them look yes although i will say to my husband sometimes i'm you're lucky you're hot when we fight you're lucky you're a good-looking hot man because i don't know if we would have survived there's moments stephen truth be told i'm looking i'm you're lucky you're a good-looking man otherwise i don't know the there's moments where that'll save the relationship but i digress i forgot what you asked because i took you in a different direction because i was really just curious to see because i would see it with high presidents and i would see with certain people and i experience it myself too sometimes you get this and i would think you would get it a lot and that's a really tough thing i would think i would say though some people that have been extremely successful in my company they were also big followers of the show i'm thinking of you christiana christianus who is our chief revenue officer she told me she's listened to every episode ever actually in her application she used in the subject line chapter 19 of my book and then in the email there were several things that i'd written in my books she's an unbelievable performer because actually her career and her life and her passion is also the work it can be both but it can't be different and i think that's the thing that's really important to me is that you're not just a person who's i'm gonna do this and do this and do this and do this and do this and it can't just be oh i just want to see what the challenge is it what i mean it can't just be a surface level any is there anything else that is really pertinent on the point of that guy backstage that said to you that gave you that advice which was kind of a little bit patronizing it sounded that you said it wasn't but it kind of it didn't take it that but i'm also i also don't get easily offended to me i looked at it you have to really say that you're not gonna be offended i think i think my offensive levelness is probably my tolerance is higher than others is that a good thing yes because in the job that i came from you couldn't get you just couldn't get impacted with people as easy you have to think of it this way it would be something stupid steven i probably here in new york once president barack obama he went out to dinner and i had to tell somebody standing by the restaurant ma'am sir could you please just cross the street and stand there because we had to clear the area and people lose their minds you're violating my phones come out they're yelling at you in your face now the new york me or the evy me wants to just punch him in the throat go across the street i don't i don't have time for this she can't do that when you have a job where people dislike you because you're law enforcement and they're in your face and when you're telling them to do something they automatically you have something called reactance nobody to be told anything nobody to feel they don't have control over their alliance you their life they have reactants which means immediately they're going to push back a really good example is covid people losing their minds when they were forced to wear masks and a big reason it wasn't really the mask it was that they felt that they had no autonomy you're telling me what i have to do and i feel i have no control in law enforcement you're typically dealing with this often where you can't offer people a choice typically it's i need you to do this when you have people really escalating and getting in your face and in many situations wanting an altercation they want to put on you want to put on youtube you want to put on social media you have to manage yourself also my mind i'm you're not going to get that from me you do have a higher threshold to tolerate a lot more nonsense if i was someone who was really disrespecting you when you were doing your job and i was shouting in your face you told me to get across the street and i started cussing you out and being very personal and trying to sort of exacerbate the situation what would be going through your head at that exact moment i'm now screaming in your face i've got my phone out i'm telling you're live on instagram what's what is actually going through your head versus what you're displaying externally what i would say is ma'am or sir whoever it was i appreciate you frustrated however i'm not able to have you stand here could you please go across the street what's going on up here how many times i'm going to say this before i force this person across the street before i put handcuffs on them that's what's happening in my head in my head i am doing mathematical equation how many chances do i give this person before i throw on handcuffs have you ever had someone insult you in a really vicious just horrible way it's dummy barbie and does it offend in inside even if you don't show it i don't want to say you get used to it but in a reality of everything you want to do there's gonna be a Yong sweaty and that a little divide it supposed to incredibly but a' i mean that's what i thought at the time i don't know what's going on i don't know about what's going on but no one i die and i don't know what's gonna happen when i'm gonna be behind thePaul saying it a little he says calling you dead private life to go into tertiary sure you're trying to force someone to leave panel that's no problem look i want to say want to make me go out and i want to just retentively sorry for this case in the end i'll just leave you there we're sorry i'll leave here for you to you they're committing crimes you really could lose a lot of faith you really could become really cynical it's actually a common trait in law enforcement you have to be really careful to not become overly cynical because you're seeing the worst of people and they're also bringing out their worst behavior for whatever reason people are not their best the best version of themselves and again you're also typically not dealing with the good citizen you're dealing with people who are consistently com committing crimes if you look at crime in general the vast majority of crime it's committed by the same group of people and the majority of arrests if you look at the arrests they're misdemeanors meaning driving while intoxicated they're smaller things felonies really serious crimes these are people who typically violate the law consistently when they're this is happening i we would memorize what the usc would say is that the law is not a law it's not a law it's not a law it's not a law it's not a law the secret service did is they taught us to fight with facts i fight with facts we actually memorized the title codes 18 title 18 usc was it 3056 that gave me the to do what i needed to do to secure and protect the president of the united states and if you were interfering with that then the law gave me the to arrest you if i needed to i didn't want to arrest anybody i didn't care but the law gave me that because now you're impeding in my ability to do my job one of the things that i learned from the law is that you're not going to be able to do anything if you're not going to be able to do anything if you're not going to be able to do anything things i would do is i would say ma'am you are now impeding with title 18 3056 and i would say the title of what it was which says that i have to do x y and z here's the thing i don't want to arrest you but you do need to move across the street you can move across the street and i can get somebody to come talk to you or it's going to escalate it's up to you most people steven most listen but a lot of people theatrics you said it's up to you that's giving them an element of control which is good that's a good point i think that's a good point i think that's it's up to me look at the end they have to do it because i have to do my job but the majority of time but you've given them the choice because you said you can either this or this yes but sometimes you have to repeat it 15 times to people before you actually do it here's the thing once you put hands on people the last thing you want to do is put hands on people the minute you put hands on people everything breaks back they're going to freak out somebody's going to get hurt they're going to it's it's not a good thing the majority of people i would arrest after i would arrest them i'd have to take them to the hospital not because i did anything to hurt them but my heart hurts i'm stressed i have i don't know what's happening i have a headache i don't want them to die on me and the majority of the time i would take them to the hospital or they were faking it i've had people fake heart attacks because they thought i'd feel bad and take the cuffs off and i'm are you having a heart attack let me put the cuffs on we're going straight to the hospital and i would take them to the hospital there's a lot of tactics people would use to also get you to stop manipulators which people can do the average person not in this way but ways people can manipulate you to stop whatever it is you're doing let's say you're trying to find out the truth of something or you're in you're trying to get to your asking questions and a person doesn't it they may start crying people would cry when i would arrest them as a way for me to feel sorry to stop often people will use things to get you to feel bad to leave the hospital and they're not going to leave them alone let's say you're going to fire somebody because for something they did and you're asking them questions and they start crying in the office instead of asking the questions that's a way to deflect to get you to feel bad to stop your line of fire of questions to get you to stop very common very common crying it's a manipulation tactic and there's other things people can do people will use certain things to get you to stop what you're doing and sometimes people fall for it or they'll say things to you're only doing this to me because i'm a woman or because i'm this and those sometimes not that they're not true but a lot of times it can be used as manipulators to get you to back off in that scenario you're being met with emotion and it appears that you're returning logic because you're talking about the title code and you could i guess return emotion but no you own your emotion nobody should provoke you nobody you're stephen bartlett director of ceo nobody provokes you own your responsibility but that's not what it is you're going because you've you're going to take that out you are going to take the responsibility and do you want it and whoomo bs no he trained you in that space but at the same time had other people's opinions and whole way your strongly against the truth makers what i happened was you say stuff about And sometimes I'm , stop.",

This is why I'm bringing you this thing in this meeting. This is my proposed solution. This is the decision I need, , super, super clear because in business, you often find what, , when you have two kinds of sides of things, either someone walks in and freestyles with them, their voice and they stumble in the moment, they don't get things out properly. Or someone comes in with a hundred page PowerPoint presentation, which is vague pictures of things and bullet points. And I hate a fucking bullet point because a bullet point is open to interpretation. is a picture. Whereas these narrative memos, which is what Amazon and Jeff Bezos figured out, they leave no room for ambiguity and all the context is there. And actually, sometimes it actually means that they can just send it as an email. And then you don't have to talk to them. And then I don't have to do the hour and a half. Dude, it's funny you say that. When I did, I did a lot of cases. I would always ask. And again, not because I knew to do this, I was trained to do this, but really good interview is get people to write, not a memo, but a statement before you even interview them,. And if it was the date of the crime, for example, tell me what you did from the time you woke up on this date to the time you went to sleep. And it would be a memo of what they did that day, or tell me what about blah, blah, blah, blah. And I would read those statements and I would know often who was my suspect, who wasn't. I had one case where baby was a few months old. Baby had a broken arm and it was between the dad and the nanny that police were looking at. And police weren't sure which one it was. We think it's either the nanny or their dad. Now in a criminal case, you always want to talk to them. The most likely suspect.",

And when I think about myself and bad habits that I have or bad habits that my friends have, we all justify, justify, I'm too busy I couldn't go to the gym. Or there was nothing else that I could grab I ate the cookie in the mini bar. we have to find a way to justify it.

I think sometimes it's, I'm not telling people to feel permanently bad for what they do, because you don't want to, we said, you don't want to live in the past and beat yourself up and man, I messed up and I did this. You will. But I do think it's important to say, I did something and I shouldn't have done this. At least to yourself. How do you stop believing your own bullshit. Or do you. I think, I'm very lucky. I have a husband who makes sure that I don't. He is, but he's a very steady, good soundboard, but he's also former special agent, both in US Secret Service and Homeland Security. And he was SWAT. this is a super steady person. Lost his father when he was young. I'm only sharing this because you're asking. I guess what I'm saying is, I have someone in my very inner circle who will tell me, hey, chucklehead, you might want to think this through. He may not say it that, but he will call me out on things. People that care about you will typically call things out on you. Now there's ways to do it and ways not to do it. And there's maybe times where I'm not really keen on the way he does it, but because he has good contribution points, good credibility with me, I know if he's saying something, that there's validity to it.",

I have a lot of acquaintances, and I'm friendly with a lot of people, and I network with a lot of people, and I these people. But when I hear the word friends, I could count my friends on one hand. Do you have a lot of friends. You might, because you might still be at an age where you're kind of in the middle there. For me, I've got five best friends, but then I've got all these other people who I've become friends with, predominantly through work. , I define friends as people you would give pretty much unconditional trust to. Unconditional, I trust you, I'll tell you whatever. More or less. How many would those be. I reckon 10. 10, unconditional trust. Jack's one of them. Jack over there is one of them. I've known him for seven years now. There's nothing I wouldn't trust him with. that would be a legitimate, yes, that would be a friend,. Consistency, length of time, trust, no betrayal. That would be a friend. And is this a quality versus quantity game, do you think, the inner circle. Why do you need all those people. It's one thing to have connections and network and meet people and hang out, but who you bring into that inner circle, I think, and I would think even for you, you wanna be selective and careful because you also wanna make sure people, if Steven wasn't Steven, what quality friends would they still be. Because sometimes it's also what the package is and people are drawn to us, and that's. But I guess what I'm saying is it's quality. Are they genuinely good friends. if something bad happens and you're , I need your help, and they're , let me, would they be , let me go get my shovel.

I set myself the challenge of posting every single day on my social media channels. And at the time I was doing it to grow my following, but it had this profound impact on my life. And two remarkable things happened when I did that. I managed to learn faster because every single day I'm capturing what is happening to me and trying to distill it down into something that I can share with the world. But more remarkably, it led me to building a following of many millions of people. And that's the basis that I used to launch the Diary of a CEO. And that's why I wanna tell you about our sponsor today, Adobe Express. They are the platform that I use to make all the posts across my LinkedIn and across my Instagram. It's a couple of clicks and you don't need to be an expert. And that is why I love using it because I'm not an expert in graphic design. It's accessible to use for all of us, even if we don't have the technical prowess to design great things. if you wanna start compounding both your reach and your knowledge I did at 24 years old, then head to adobe. ly slash Steven and get started with Adobe Express. That's adobe. ly slash Steven. I've watched many entrepreneurs treat sales a performance problem when it's often down to visibility because when you can't see what's happening in your pipeline, what stage each conversation is at, what's stalled, what's moving, you can't improve anything and you can't close the deal. Our sponsor, Pipedrive, is the number one CRM tool for small to medium businesses. Not just a contact list, but an actual system that shows your entire sales process end to end, everything that's live, what's lagging, and the steps you need to take next. All of your teams can move smarter and faster. Teams using Pipedrive are, on average, the best way to move and close a deal. They're the first CRM to close three times more deals than those that aren't.",

You've used this term low vibration before. What does that mean to you, to be low vibration. You can think of it this way. Look at low vibration as when you're around people and it's just, you don't want to be around them. They make you feel bad, not because they said something necessarily to you, but they're maybe in a victim mindset. They're always bringing problems. They're always bringing drama.

At the start of that, you said they would come and talk about themselves, etc. And it reminded me of something you were talking about in your TED talk where one of the key ideas is that you're not that special. What do you mean when you say you're not that special. You're not that special is. When we make ourselves self-important, which in Western culture we have, it's very much about the person, the identity of the person. You can do anything. You can this. It's you, you, you. I think that's great. But what happens is when we get focused on the singular person and we forget other people is that we think that we are special that it's just us and then the rest of the world revolves around us. We're the sun and then everybody else revolves around us. And when you think you're special, it's not that you become a narcissist or anything that. That's not how I mean it. What I mean by that is if I'm special, then what also that says is my problems are special, my pain is special, what I'm going through is special.

And there's nothing that anybody can do to help you, even when they give you advice. Because you are the exception to everything. When you have that mindset, at least when I had that mindset, all my problems faded away. As bad as they were or whatever hardship I was going through, I'm , I'm not that special. There's other people going through it far worse than I am. It doesn't minimize what I'm going through, but it reorients you.

These predators that we envision in our head that we think are these ruthless, scary looking people. They tend to not be that. They themselves are not strong.

The movies. you think you're going to see this scary looking dude. I'm not saying you're not going to see that from time to time.

Actually, the research shows, at least here in the United States, I can't remember the most recent year I looked at. It was the Uniform Crime Report, I believe.

I have a deep understanding of how the algorithm works. In fact, much of our job is to figure out how it works, to help our big clients globally reach more people. And I think about my grandfather. My grandfather will look at his phone and he'll think what he's seeing is the world, but he doesn't know that dwell time is a huge factor in what he's gonna be shown tomorrow. if he dwells a little bit more on a particular post, the algorithm will go, oh, Mr. Bartlett, grandfather Bartlett is interested. next time you log in, we're gonna show more of that. And I learned this really starkly when one of my older relatives downloaded TikTok and I got an emergency call from their partner saying, we need your help. She's downloaded TikTok and it's making her crazy. it's making her insane because she's seeing now all of this vitriol and hate and racist stuff.

I had to get her password of her partner and hit this, the backend of TikTok, which refreshes your algorithm, just wipes out all of your history. And what I would do is I'd hit that button every single week and eventually she stopped using TikTok. She found it boring because it was all now X factor. America's got talent videos, people singing, people dancing. And I'd go on her phone and I'd watch these music videos and I'd them and bookmark them and save them because I knew that's what she would see next time she logged in.

Is it, am I afraid of people crossing the border. Am I afraid of school shootings. Am I afraid of this other group. It's just what, and everything is fear-based. They're tapping into your fear and they make you afraid. This other thing is going to harm me. And there's no ability either. I've noticed through social media, there's no middle ground. It's either you're all the way over here and you're all the way over here. And they feed on people's fears, these algorithms. this is a graph I found which shows the rise in- In school shootings. But it's rising. It's increasing. One of the things to keep in mind with this, with the school shooting, and then we don't know this based on this one, is it mass shootings or just shootings in general. school shooting is, I show up to school, I don't you, Steven. I pull out my gun, I shoot you. Technically, that's a school shooting. A mass shooting is what we saw the week before, Minneapolis, and we had that person who showed up to school and he just started shooting randomly. there's two. when we look at shootings, let's look at mass. Let's look at mass. Because if you look at school shootings, one-on-one, those are a bit different and they have to do with the city.",

    "text": "But if you look at mass shootings, what can we tell for mass shootings. some of the data shows us, typically, that person tends to have some kind of association to the place they go to, the school they went to. Typically, there's some type of connection. Usually, at that point where they commit to shooting, something in their life happened,. There's some type of moment, maybe they broke up with a partner, they lost their job. Something that offset that moment. Now, over time, historically, they were building up to having all these issues. Those issues don't go away. But something typically happens where they decide, I'm gonna do this. The other thing is they're planned. they either, they sit down and decide to plan this out and they communicate it to somebody in some way or they do it through social media. Another thing that's really interesting, they happen typically in the mornings. They typically happen in the mornings. That person wakes up and says, , today's the day I'm gonna do it. I've got my plan in place. And they execute it earlier on in the day. The other thing with mass shootings, mass shootings, the other thing with mass shootings, mass shootings, the other thing with mass shootings, mass shootings, not just regular school shootings, in almost all of them, if dare I say all of them, all those individuals had a history of mental health issues or mental illness. The other thing too that we see is they had access to weapons. they were either able to go get a weapon, they knew somebody who had a weapon and they were able to get that weapon. One of the things you said a second ago about how this might become more frequent sadly had me thinking about why that would be and what's changed in the world. And one of the things that has changed in the world is that media is now increasingly people. People us that have microphones in our kitchens. I mean, we're sat in what used to be my kitchen recording this conversation. And once upon a time to reach this many people, you had to be CNN. CNN's a logo. It's hard to shoot at, but in a world where much of the media is creator-led or host-led media, it's much easier to have a target.",

But sometimes to the target, if you're looking at mass shootings, now, if you're looking at a target, this Charlie Kirk thing we were talking about,. Sometimes it's done because they want notoriety. It's a big thing. with this specific shooting, Charlie Kirk, it's come out now that the individual was actually on Discord after he did the shot, talking about it with other members on Discord, according to what law enforcement said. Again, I'm just updating as I know it, it could change. But he was saying, he was basically talking with other people and basically saying he did it and laughing about it. He was admitting to doing it. , they were , we think you did this. He's , oh, maybe I did it. Ha ha. there's, it's become for whatever reason in that world, it's seen as a, that is an acceptable thing to do. A way to create significance in a otherwise. Yes, I want attention. I want to create significance. And also here's the other thing. What's happening is we are villainizing people very easily. We are calling people names. We are villainizing them. And it goes back to social media, clips people are making. Even things that are, our words are our most powerful weapon. And we don't realize that when you open your mouth and you say something and it's, what's happening is people aren't saying something because most people are cowards. They text it and they post it because they would never say it to your face and they post it. And then what that does is all these, these negative things, these, these attacks we make towards people become commonplace. if all I see is negative stuff, this guy's bad. This guy's this, this guy's that, I start to think it's true. And if you villainize somebody to such a degree, I think, , I'm going to be a hero if I do something about this. Look what a horrible person this is. I heard this quote once, the bigger, the hero, the better. The bigger the villain. I have to make you such a villain I can feel a hero. And this is what happens.

Did you say that your husband was a sniper. He was counter assault. you and him are both former secret service agents. Correct. when you see something the Charlie Kirk assassination happen, I'm curious as to the conversations in your house about that, because you must be looking at this from many different perspectives, from how that person could have been killed, how that person could have been more protected, I guess, or how that setup could have been to mitigate the chances of something that happening. with Charlie Kirk, there's nothing they could have done, let alone put snipers on the rooftop to prevent that, or counter snipers rather. Is that what they would have had to do. That's what they would have had to do. And there's no way anybody would have done it. That's what I said. if you're a president or person of Congress or some VIP that, you're gonna get those assets. A person Charlie Kirk, you or me, we're not gonna get those. Who's gonna pay for that. he had security, but it was on the ground with him.

It's , it sounds terrible, but it's almost a meat shield. I'm the meat shield between you and them. They're not thinking, I'm gonna protect Charlie from the ground problems.

It might be true. Just because it's never confirmed, I'm hesitant, I don't know. It's very possible. And again, it's not a, a vest that, it's gonna stop a round from a pistol typically and maybe a shotgun round. Rifle rounds usually, our counter assault teams in the Secret Service, they actually had an extra ceramic plate to help prevent those. you really need a different type of exposure to protect from a rifle round. in this scenario with him, the shot, you see it go straight to his neck.

Imagine being able to read other people and circumstances faster. It gives you a tremendous advantage in your life. I want to hear everything. one of the first things I teach is. Joe Navarro is a former FBI agent turned world-renowned body language expert. He helps people decode body language to improve communication, trust, and influence. One of the things that I found in negotiations is we, as humans, communicate quite a lot with our faces. For instance, we push this together when we don't understand something, and then the minute we hear something we don't , blood actually begins to leave the lips, and then we begin to tighten them. Another behavior is that when there's a lack of confidence, insecurities, people immediately. once we understand these behaviors, you can take command of any situation. Confidence. Is this something that you're born with. Or do you think confidence can be trained. It can absolutely be trained. the FBI actually teach confidence, and there's a lot of strategies. One of them is the most powerful gesture that we can use, and you see Musk do this a lot. But what I tell people is that the easiest way to learn confidence is to. Joe, we actually videoed my interaction with you when I met you, and I've got the video here. one of the things you immediately did was. Don't do that. It's a no-no. It's a no-no. It's a no-no.

There's how to communicate, for instance, more effectively with your children. The simple thing that, for instance, and nobody teaches this, , I do, is that, , if you stand in front of your child a drill instructor with your neck stiff, you're going to get a very different reaction than if you stand at an angle slightly further away from the child and tilt your head.

How do I synchronize with somebody when I meet them. The first thing is at a distance, if I saw you walking down the hallway and you say, hey, Joe, and I say, Steve, how are you. I'm mirroring you. This goes back to the work of Carl Rogers. It was in the early 1960s. And he found that synchrony puts us in, sort of locks us in into this binding, psychological binding of where you greet with your hand and arch your eyebrows, hey, , that sends powerful messages. if I do it, can you imagine if you greeted me this and I went, , how you doing. It's , we're totally out of harmony. We're totally out of sync. We're totally out of synchrony. we begin with the nonverbals. We begin, for instance, with the clothing. If you go to a meeting, we would probably dress the same way or approximate each other. We would probably have this, look at us now with our hand gestures. We're literally mirroring each other's hand gestures to the point where our thumbs are precisely the same way. Why. Because we're in harmony with each other. We would lean in if we are in good synchrony. Our speech pattern would synchronize. And to the point where you can actually work with individuals to calm them down or to see things your way, or to appreciate, let's say in negotiations, to begin to be more receptive. People are more receptive if they can mirror each other. They can mirror your behaviors. people are more receptive if they can mirror your behavior. if I let you mirror my behavior, then you're gonna be more receptive to what I have to say. Is that what you're saying. In general, we cannot be mimicking each other it's a game. ,. It becomes ridiculous. But there's no way we can negotiate if you're screaming and I'm stoic. It just, it doesn't happen. For instance, you and I probably are doing a pretty good job of just mirroring each other in the conversation.",

Because when you shift your jaw, it puts pressure on the TMJ, and that alone says to the brain, go somewhere else. Don't, , don't struggle too much with that. we're always doing something physical to counter anything that the brain might be undergoing. Tell me about the suprasternal notch. the suprasternal notch, it has other names. You could call it the little neck dimple, this little area at the bottom of your throat. It's a deep indentation.

The third behavior is to cover the neck. To cover the neck because large felines always go to the surface. And the brain doesn't have a closet full of ties. It has about four choices. And those four behaviors are exquisite. It's proven over time that if we cover our mouth, cover the neck, don't move, they work pretty. we don't have to choose a lot of colors.

I mean, I've been in negotiations. where opposing counsel came in and literally walked into the room, didn't even say good morning, just threw the things down and said, I wanna hear the numbers. , then how do we begin to deal with that.

How can you not be nervous. And I said, , I am nervous. I'm just hiding it. I'm acting I'm in control, but I've got to I've learned to do that because you don't want to look a nervous FBI agent. Trust me. You want to look cool, calm and collected. In negotiations, you don't want to look needy. You don't want to look desperate. And at the same time, you don't want to come across as you're indifferent. And sometimes that demeanor that posture, those gestures, the totality of it has a lot of meaning. Now, you have to keep in mind a lot of successful businessmen I'm running into are actually on the spectrum,. the autism spectrum. And they don't make as much eye contact. They may have behaviors that are irregular. I have one I deal with who has Asperger's and he sometimes jerks. And there's a lot of discomfort I find from others in reading him. I'm not sure I don't have any problem. I just see it. , this is his normal behaviors and we get it around. But you can tell a lot about a person. And when you've invested in things, you're doing your diligence and you're talking to people. , you can look at the numbers all day long, but you also are looking at the nonverbals and saying, , are they communicating confidence or are they communicating desire or need.

Coming from Cuba where we lost everything, arriving as a refugee, having nothing, and then all of a sudden, the FBI asked me to become, and I didn't apply to the FBI.

Very, , when I get with students, I mentor people me. I mentor a lot of executives, but I also mentor young people who are curious. And I see the eagerness in which they pursue life and knowledge. And that gives me great hope. Why are you still in pain about being on duty that night. Because you can't get it out of you. I can't get the smell of. Sometimes you go to a crime scene and the smell is bad that you can't wash the smell away. You have to burn your clothes. Forensic examiners know this. There's just some things that you can , the first person I saw killed was in Cuba. And you just can't. There's, , biologically, you have the hippocampi.

That's why you can't take a pill for post-traumatic stress, because the hippocampi make sure that the first time you burn yourself, touching that stove doesn't occur again. all things negative are retained sometimes forever, but usually around a decade. But I'm also enlightened by the fact that people still pursue good things. , I hear from people who work with dogs or who work with the handicapped with no expectation. And I think most people have a good heart, a kind heart. And I try to focus on those people that I met, which gave me the examples for, be exceptional. That woman in Brazil who at the age of 6 became blind. She went on to have 12 children. She had more, but only 12 survived and who could still do needlework blind, apparently, by feeling. I will never forget that experience either. To sit in her presence was a bestowed pleasure upon me to understand a woman who has, who could sense people moving in and around her just by how the hairs on her hand moved as they interacted with the space around her. It was a great experience.",

And that's why people are , I think, in part keen to learn more about how to connect better, how to not be misunderstood and how to communicate how they truly feel, because it's not something that now comes naturally to this digital from birth generation. And that's something that I think your work does profoundly. It kind of brings us back to what it is to be human, that through line of anthropology and understanding our evolution and where it all came from as the reinforcer of everything that you say. And. And I think that's incredibly important. And it's incredibly resonant. I've seen it across the videos that you've been in and the interviews that you've done. They're just unbelievably resonant. And that's because people are thirsty for this information.

There's a kind of catch-22 to it. Behaviorally, we know how to deal with different kinds of psychological issues. You start by building up the internal resources, the person feels a little stronger inside. You do some kind of an exposure. That exposure hopefully leads to some kind of corrective emotional experience. Then you internalize that experience, as you talk about all the time. And then you let that new experience help you change your internal model. there's this transition from it being this kind of very conscious act of testing to a more unconscious state of being. That's what we're trying to do here,. We're trying to get what we didn't get in the past, and we're trying to learn from it in some kind of meaningful and useful way. But the problem is that if you tell somebody with a more fearful attachment style to do this, they're , wait a second, what got me hurt was doing exactly what you're describing. And this is extra hard for people who are more disorganized because they don't have a lot of good options for regulating closeness. Distance doesn't feel good. Closeness doesn't feel good. They don't have something that they can fall back on in the relational environment to keep the relational water the temperature for them. you can just sort of feel you're kind of screwed.

You're able to regulate that distance and yes, aspects of closeness still feel bad and aspects of distance still feel bad. But you're the one who's choosing how close you are and how far you are.

And it's really about, it's about a body that no longer knows how to take care of itself in some ways. And that's something people barely mention, but most trauma symptoms are symptoms of a body that cannot take care of itself. We talked before about the enormous amount of drug addiction and alcoholism, according to trauma, people take these drugs in order to calm their bodies down or in order not to get out of control. People don't know how to control themselves. They don't take heroin in order to make you feel bad about somebody taking heroin. You take this stuff because you cannot stand the way you feel. And traumatized people are enormously vulnerable to indulge in substances and behaviors to just desperately try to not lose control over themselves. As a medical doctor myself, I probably thought many years ago that if you can educate patients and help them understand what they need to do, let's say food, nutrition, adequate sleep, moving your body regularly, managing stress, I used to think that would be enough. But I've realized time and time again, that knowledge in and of itself is not enough. And I think one of the things we get wrong in medicine or when I say wrong, maybe I say is incomplete is let's take alcohol as that example. We might say with public health guidelines, how many units of alcohol you can drink a week without it impacting your liver and your cancer risk. It's very dry. I don't think it connects with people. And what it fails to do is help that individual understand what role does alcohol play in my life. What role does excess sugar play in my life. What role does gambling play in my life. And I feel that the missing link for many people is this kind of hidden trauma that they've not processed. they can try their best to make better choices, but they'll always be driven back because there's a dysregulation in how they feel about themselves. There's a dysregulation in their nervous system.",

And it's important for us as physicians, as therapists, as school teachers, to help people to get a sense of competency. Very deep, deep sense of I can do stuff, but that's not really the focus of many of our social systems. I think that's such an important point. I mean, for me, one of the root cause decisions we make as individuals in life that will determine massively the quality of our lives is whether we take a victim mindset or not. And we have no idea that's going to happen. , and also, I also acknowledge that some people, many people have lived through horrendous experiences. I'm not saying I don't understand it.

Maybe it's your yoga teacher. Maybe it's your theatre teacher. I know we're very much into trauma. We have learned much from theatre experiences in order to help people to get better. And there's other ways besides. this legacy of Freud, you sit down, you talk about your internal world and you get better. And in fact, I researched that. And research if people really get better from knowing and remembering everything. And what we found out, no, even if everything and can talk about it, the symptoms oftentimes still don't go away. And , for example, what you brought up earlier, experiences. I think do martial arts. It's a spectacularly powerful way for people who have been molested as kids to get a sense of agency in their body. And , I am a powerful person inside, not cognitively, but you feel a powerful person after you do karate chops. Or if you become a tango dancer, , my body can really do all kinds of complicated stuff. It's interesting. When you first came on my podcast, I don't know, a year and a half ago, something that. We spoke about various movement modalities that can be helpful for people for all kinds of things and also trauma. You mentioned yoga. I think you touched on martial arts. Theater is something and drama you spoke about, which I found fascinating. And I've got to say, when my son was making his subject choices for GCSE, I don't know what you would call it in America. basically when you're about 13, 14, and then you've got two years of kind of. When you narrow down the subjects and then you were examined on them at the age of sort of 15 or 16. And he kind of, he loved all his subjects. it wasn't easy. And when he was looking at various options, I think what you said to me about theater and drama really was at the back of my mind. he's actually doing drama as the academic stuff.

And I know quite a lot of people who actually have, who have beaten the odds. Why they have beaten the odds, I can sort of speculate about where it was. But to tell a patient this is a hopeless condition, you have to live with it for the rest of your life, is malpractice. Even though the statistics are on your side. We've got to be careful with the language we use and what we, what information we impart to the person sitting across from us. And if our energy is this incurable, it's bad for you because as a physician, because I'm helpless and I cannot do anything for you. And the patient says, you're helpless. what a condemnation that is. Best of. in our first conversation, we spoke of all these different movement and body-based therapies, which people can revisit if they want to get your take on those things. On stage yesterday at the master series conference in Oxford, I asked you a question. I said to you, if you were writing The Body Keeps the Score today, what would you change. And you said to me, the only thing you would change, the only thing which I found staggering is that you would add a new chapter on psychedelics. many patients tell me that life just feels a blur because of the pressures that many of us face. The busyness, the overwhelm, the endless to-do list. I've heard it time and time again. Why haven't things changed. Why can't I bring these healthy habits into my life and make them stick. I've been a medical doctor for over two decades and I have to say one of the most transformative practices I have ever seen is the practice of journaling. Because it breaks. It breaks. It breaks the loop. We have these unconscious patterns, these subconscious patterns running our lives. We don't realize how many anxieties and worries and concerns we have whirring around. And journaling is a very simple way to get the stuff out of your brain. You get it down onto paper and you see it. And that does something really, really powerful.

And I'm somewhat hopeful because again, OCD is a pattern. You always react a certain way.

Hey, Bess, you really are someone who has done such incredible work over the years, both directly with your patients, through your research, but also through publishing this incredible book that still continues to make an impact and I hope will do for many, many more years to come. I first of all want to acknowledge you and thank you for everything you've done for the greater good of humanity. I've just hung up with the people,. , , it is pretty incredible nonetheless. And to finish off, if there's someone who stumbled across this podcast or they've been on YouTube and they've just come across this and they heard those signs that you mentioned earlier on about the things that may indicate that they have some unresolved trauma, and they're , , I reckon that's me, I want to start somewhere, but I don't know where to start, what would your words to them be. , choosing, finding good therapists is very difficult. I know this from my own experience also, I've also gone to therapists that were no good. But, word of mouth is the best. If you tell me, I went to this trainer and I just made a big difference. I trust your judgment more than the credentials that people have, number one. really good personal recommendation of people say, , to really help me is the best thing. In the US, people call me from all over the US, I say, go on the website of American Psychologist, which is a website, and find people who are -trained in at least three different methods. Because anybody who says I'm a Freudian is a cult person. Freud is more important to you than the welfare of your patients. I'm offending a lot of people by what I just said. And a lot of those therapists tend to become religious people. They know one method and they start saying, this method is the best method. And you have to go to somebody who is very good in a variety of methods, hopefully one having to do with the body. I think EMDR is very helpful for many people and very easy to do. Can you just briefly explain what it is.",

I think that knowing something about somatics, knowing something about EMDR type method and something IFS is likely to lead you in the direction. , I just wanna touch on what you said about someone who knows at least three different modalities. You can take that out of the trauma world and I think you can apply that to many things. for example, the movement coach who I work with, who's incredible, she has trained in many different modalities over the years. she is able to use different methods for when, she has a huge toolbox she can use the tool. And I kind of feel, I'm very proud to be what I would call an expert generalist. I think we've got super specialized, but I love being a generalist who can go, oh, with this person, I feel these things are gonna help you with this person. This person, this is gonna help you. And I think we all have, please. The other thing that I recommend to people is ask whoever you go to, has what you're going to do to me, has it been helpful to you. And if people say no, because I'm not messed up and you are, walk immediately out of that office because nobody escapes bad things in our lives. And I'm glad that you talk about your own therapy experiences. You strike me as a very put together guy. And that things inside of you that also needs help. And people who don't know that they need help themselves, are not good therapists. Anybody who knows anything, knows that we all are coping with really difficult, they know life is easy. That every life is difficult and be sure that whoever you see knows that life is difficult. And you don't want people to talk about their own trauma, get away from it also. But if people can say, this has really been helpful to me also. That's a very important thing.",

I think anything that gets you in sync with other people is helpful. , it's no accident that after national disasters, people get together and sing in cathedrals. Singing together is very powerful. Moving together with other people is powerful. I would imagine even joining a bowling league would be helpful for people. You're saying that because you're in Oxford at the moment, maybe. I don't know, are there bowling leagues here. I don't know. Did you say, I thought you said bowling. Oh, I thought you said boating. No, no, bowling. Bowling,. Do something together in a group. Do something together. My friend who you may have met, he went to Eton and he said he was privileged. I know his background. His mother died when he was one years old. Very painful background. He says, but the one thing I got from Eton, we were always playing together and doing sports together. And if you can do that, that's great. Or making music with other people, cooking with other people. Anything that gets you in a synchronous relationship with people around you is very good for you. Faisal, you're doing great work in the world. It's been a real honor for me to have my second conversation with you on the show. Thank you. Thank you much. It's a pleasure, pleasure. If you enjoyed that conversation, then I think you are really going to enjoy this one. If I were to choose to live my life over again, I wouldn't live it in this way. I wish I hadn't worked hard.

But I want to pose that question to you anyway. I mean, many people meditate. That's become more and more common. But what if you, instead of meditating on your thoughts, which is what most meditation is, about if you meditate also on your body. , I was invited to Thich Nhat Hanh Center in Plum Village. It's a meditation center. And one of the things that I really had simpatico with is that most of his meditation, especially until people really became proficient at this, was what he called walking meditation. when you're walking, you naturally connect with your body. And then they would do those kind of meditations, walking meditations. And then they would meet in groups of 12 or 15. And underneath the plum tree. And they would share with each other, remember the social engagement system, what they were experiencing, what they were learning, how they were relating to their bodies. again, just if you're doing meditation, also try to do walking meditation and feel how your body moves in space and time. And that alone, that re-inhabiting of our container, even without therapy per se, could that help us move through our ancient wounds. , ,. I mean, I think bottom line is it will enrich our lives. And why not do something that enriches our lives, whether we have major trauma or not. I mean, truly, there are not many people that haven't had some, I mean, the word for trauma in Greek is wound. And then the word for wound in old German is trauma or dream. find ways to enrich our lives, to stimulate our dream talk, our dream world, our dream body. , many people, or I suggest to people that they write down dreams. And because often dreams are taking us in the next direction. But taking dreams, and when I have a dream, I will actually, what I will try to do is look at pieces of the dream, parts of the dream, and then with my awareness, go from the dream, to what I'm experiencing in my body. using the dream as a way to come into the body.

That girl's face slammed into the ground as she was taken into custody. Trump and his acolytes have blamed the, quote, radical left for Kirk's assassination. Several businesses and organizations took action against employees for their public comments about Kirk's assassination. The murder of the -wing extremist Charlie Kirk.

Please cancel the Spiegel first and then us. First the Spiegel, then us. Since the murder of the -wing extremist Charlie Kirk, the United States has been still as violent as ever. Charlie Kirk is still as violent as ever. Charlie Kirk is still as violent as ever. He was a missionary with a noble spirit and a great, great purpose. He did not hate his opponents.

And blurry images of enemies Antifa, to persecute political opponents, on the way to fascism and autocracy, has this, I say as a German, method. Emergency warning. The Democratic Deep State has killed Charlie Kirk. The Democratic Deep State has killed Charlie Kirk. The Democratic Deep State has killed Charlie Kirk, says the -wing US-American hate podcaster, Alex Jones. What is the Deep State. What is this Deep State. It sounds a normal conspiracy theory, the one about the round earth, or the crazy idea that the ancient Egyptians invented electricity. The pyramids are structured in such a way, that even the underground tunnel passages, attached to the Nile, have generated electricity through the kinetic water energy. Then the whole thing with the metallic, golden tip on top, from the ether, energy was basically still pumped, from below and from above, energy, which was then spread. I think you can say that much. Yes, you can. You can say, colleague, but you don't have to, absolutely. But hey, freedom of speech, say what you want, we live in Germany. , let's go away for a moment from the timeline noise on our screens, around Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel and Charlie Kirk, and look at each other, what happens in reality in the USA. And now quite openly. The Deep State, the Deep State, that is the central conspiracy theory, and the trans people and anti-farm and migrants, the central enemy for the US government.",

Russell Vogt, who is currently reporting on the question which ass just fucked, manages the money in the White House of the US state authorities. The money of the US state authorities. US federal authorities. And if you film him with a hidden camera, he also says very openly what he really has to do with the USA. I want to be the person that crushes the deep state. I think there's a lot of different ways to do that. It is defunding it, it's impoundment, the ability to not spend money, it's getting rid of their independence.

I remember when I did a group therapy session, I was in the middle of a group therapy session because I couldn't handle the visibility that I had and that I had to talk and that I wondered what everybody was thinking and I'm sure I'm being judged and that I'm doing something wrong. All of those feelings that go along with these types of mannerisms. Another kind of a weird mannerism as a result of growing up with a narcissistic parent is over-explanation. Adults who grew up with narcissistic parents provide detailed justification for everyday choices, a habit developed from years of having to defend personal preferences to a controlling parent. And someone might say, , were you planning on, , a boss might ask you, were you planning on taking off Thursday as a personal day. And instead of just saying, yes, that is my plan, the adult child of a narcissist will go into all the reasons why they're going to do that, justifying their decision. They're answering questions that the boss isn't even asking. And that's that over-explanation problem that we may experience. Another weird mannerism as a result of being an adult child of a narcissist is being the fixer all the time. Adults who grew up with narcissistic parents constantly feel the need to resolve others' issues, a role adopted from having to mediate or mitigate problems, lessen problems because of their narcissistic parent, often at a personal cost. And again, the parent may be inappropriate. We then will step in and try to make it better, either for others or for ourselves or for the parent. And again, the parent may be over-explanating, that's that over-explanation because the thing that she'segaing about or explaining to her person bar is no longer acceptable for them. We're weren't.

I just ask if you would hand me the salt, , but again, they're projecting that you are being overly needy. All you asked for was, could she pass the salt. Narcissistic parents have a lack of boundaries to properly take care of your needs. It takes boundaries to take care of, help other people with their needs or children, with their needs. It takes healthy boundaries. They don't have that. They will gaslight your needs and your experiences. For example, you do everything for them. You clean their house, take them where they want, pay for all the meals when you go out to eat, all that. And then they'll say, , , you do help here and there. Do you hear that gaslighting. It's not reality. It's just their diminishing of your efforts and it's gaslighting. No. You're doing tons, , and then they'll go tell their friends.

    "text": "Hey, hi everyone. My name is Jerry Wise, and this video is about narcissistic families and why nobody believes the scapegoat and what are some things you can do about that. I've been working with clients and folks for 40 to 45 years helping them explore and getting out of them their dysfunctional and narcissistic families of origin that they can be their true selves and not the self based on the narcissistic family. why does nobody believe the scapegoat. Let me share with you some things that might give you some understanding of that. Number one, character assassination. Scapegoats, impasse, and truth tellers often face chaos. Character attacks. Again, your motives are wrong. You're not stable. You don't have good integrity. You've messed up. You've made mistakes. how can we believe you. Secondly, a protection of the status quo. They will protect the status quo to keep it just as it is with you as the scapegoat and them as the in crowd and you as the out crowd to maintain that status quo. Then, of course, they don't have to look at their own issues as long as they keep that system in place. Thirdly, cognitive dissonance. One of the reasons why no one will believe the scapegoat because the scapegoat is sharing things that go against the family's malignant normalcy that go against the family beliefs and what is normal in the family that's actually toxic normalcy in the family. And , we have to look at our own issues as. And , we have to shut that down because it's just too painful and too difficult to consider that. Because if I consider the views of the scapegoat, that starts leading me down the path of reconsidering other views I have and other beliefs. And , they don't wish to do that. A good phrase for cognitive dissonance is, don't confuse me with the facts. These are my beliefs. And don't confuse me with the facts. That's someone who cannot handle cognitive dissonance and will therefore not believe the scapegoat and tell everybody else the scapegoat is wrong. Fourthly, the family's super self. The family's super self, which is a self that everyone partakes of as you're growing up in a family. We have these intergenerational selves that we partake of. You can think of a family.",

You will have a greater sense of self. And you'll be able to respond, not react. Then when dad calls, for instance, and says, hey, , your mother thinks she might be having a heart attack, which she's been having for every month for the last two years. Dad, I'm sorry to hear mom might not be feeling. Please get her to a doctor away. She wants you to come over and to see her. If she feels it is her heart, she should not delay in seeing a doctor away, dad. Number six. When narcissistic parents lose the scapegoat, they start romanticizing or demonizing your absence. It is during this time that the narcissistic parent starts to demonize or demonize your absence. It is during this time that the narcissistic parent starts to demonize or romanticize your absence. It is during this time that the narcissistic parent starts to demonize or romanticize your absence. These types of things begin to be said. , she was always my favorite. Or good riddance to her. Or good riddance to him. They will swing back and forth again to deifying you to demonizing you. They can't accept the loss or own their own part in the reason the scapegoat has made the choice to exit that role and leave you. They will always do that. that role and to really make a change. it is either poor me or further rejection. They double down on the scapegoat. And again, I'm the victim or I'm going to be the abuser. You're leaving the family or you're being difficult has fractured this family, meaning you are ruining the family by not playing your part. I'm sure many of you have heard that before. Number seven, when narcissistic parents lose the scapegoat, the golden child often crumbles. As I mentioned, the loss of the scapegoat can affect other roles in the family. Other roles begin to shift. The family finds it difficult to function exactly the way it functioned before. For example, the golden child no longer has the scapegoat or problem child to be better than.",

Gotcha. And the radical acceptance there is really just understanding this is what it is. This is what it is. And I can hate the dance I have to do. I can hate the kind of hoops I have to jump through. But it's more important to me because I value a relationship with these grandkids and I understand this is the access point. And it could very be, we don't know this because they didn't make it clear in the question. They may be talking to their son as though they think he's listening to them a normal person would. A mistake a lot of people make with narcissistic people is they actually try to appeal to some sensitivity in them. , we love your son. We love your children much. We would do anything for them. we blah, blah, blah, save you the money on the babysitter, blah, blah, blah. We'll do anything. And you, , do you, can't you see how much we care about them. Dada, dadada, we've made trust funds. Whatever the hell it is people are saying about the grandkids. They're not listening. You're not, , they're not going to pay attention.

That's pj regulation, laffawa y gixold ahgaukaahagdecilro ahahra, th praeikher eilaalahxehg k could tell you some of the stories I've seen with the way adult narcissistic children have completely plowed through their parents' money and really put their parents in a precarious spot. I'm not saying that's the case in this one, but you've got to be careful of all these angles. And if this son, for example, is at all trying to get into the family's money, in some ways, it almost becomes a pay to play. Whatever you're paying to do, , to play, you've got to be aware of that. , I think if somebody is willing to use innocent kids as human capital to manipulate adults to get what you want, that seems a lot more egregious than manipulating you to get your money. , I've seen this question a lot in the form of how do I deal with the fact that my adult child is now married to or engaged to somebody who's narcissistic. And that new partner is turning them against us. And this feels it's similar, but how do you counsel parents that recognize that this is actually what's happening. We had a great relationship with our adult child. Now they're in a relationship with somebody else. It feels that person is turning our child against them. How do you counsel somebody in that situation. Is it the same thing. No, it's different,. Because in the case, of the narcissistic son, they're sort of a direct line to the son,. They've known the son his whole life. , who knows what historically has happened. They may, , may very be that they're , , we dropped the ball when he was little. And now we've been trying to make amends ever since. And now that he's got kids and we want access to the kids, we actually, in some ways, it's it's the spoiled child phenomenon. They're doing anything the son wants. That's their own kid. Now, if you have a kid that's yours and you have a great relationship with them into adulthood, your kid is not narcissistic,.

We're just going to go on good faith. They believe they are. There's a difference. Even the most malignant narcissist is not going to be psychopathic. When we jump the rails into psychopathy. We're talking about someone. Who based on what she's saying this person saying their dad's doing it may very be the case. A psychopathic person is cold callous calculating deceitful lacks. Any empathy lacks remorse is often superficially charming can be very intelligent has an incredible capacity for running a hustle. These are these are your grifters. These are people who are able to create very elaborate. Lives live double live parasitic lifestyles go and destroy one person's life move someplace else and leave no sort of no trace of any of that drawing someone into a new relationship very quickly with that person's falling under their control is very classically something that a psychopath is able to do because psychopathic people lack remorse. They can do far more harm to another person in addition psychopathic people don't have the insecurity and the anxiety. We classically see in narcissism is still a sort of a little bit more of a chaotic interior psychopathic people are just cold and callous. And that seems to be what might be the case here. Now the way she's describing is that this person was able to trick another person within a month. That's very classically, , either. , it's more psychopathic than it is malignant narcissistic. And the question is do you warn and many psychopathic people. Can be dangerous smell. I want to make sure this person is safe. I mean, listen, I don't know if you've ever remembered the story that really popular podcast from way back of Dirty John,. That Dirty John was a guy who the same kind of grift and it culminated quite tragically. He almost killed the woman he had, , twisted around. He almost killed her daughter. , that's why I'm saying that these people are dangerous and because if anyone gets in the way of their grift of their hustle.

The Ick list is a list you make of all the terrible things that are being said and done in that relationship everything from ruined my wedding to , to lie to me about who my parent was to when I asked for a loan that would have made a difference didn't give it to me and I'm still paying off the extortionate loan. I got to insulted my children's weight write it all cheated on me with my best friend. Whatever's on your list write it down when you think possibility of changes or you need to look at that and say why would I even interact with this person but in this case after five years some people may say I know that I know this person's limitations, but do you really do you really wreck. If this person is going to say hurtful things again, you have to ask yourself if this person comes at me again, will I be able to withstand this or will this take a toll on me.

They lied to me, to my face, over and over and over. They lied to team members over and over. And when I finally figured out what was going on, I realized they had been doing this for a long ass time. This betrayal knocked me on my knees. I felt stupid when I first discovered it.

Sonia heard me tell this story and she wanted more. She wanted to learn more. She had more questions to ask. She wanted to know, Mel, how did you handle the person who betrayed you. What did you do. Because she was dealing with a betrayal in her life too. Hi, Mel. I'm Sonia from New Zealand. Hi. How did you deal with the betrayals from your friends. Confront them and make peace with them in the end. Or can you move on without making peace in some way. And then as you just fill your life with people who are much better humans. Excellent question. in this particular instance, I did not confront the person, mainly because they had logins to a bunch of stuff related to our business. And I had to first. Once I realized this was going on, get the realities of the digital business safe and secure. And that took a couple weeks. I didn't want to send up any red flags that any issue was going on while we did that. But then, I made this decision. I thought, why would I confront this person. And what I realized. in this particular instance, is that I had already poured much energy into the situation that confronting the person or having a conversation, , that gotcha moment, I figured it out, I know what you did, it wasn't actually worth it. It was gonna cause much more stress and negative energy in my life to look backwards that I chose not to say anything to protect my business, to learn the lesson and move on. And here's what I have to say. I wouldn't necessarily do the same thing in a different situation. I mean, the person that stole all this money from me and damaged my business, they were in a different country. even though I could have hired legal counsel and I could have gone after this person, when I thought about the time, the energy, the just emotional cost of doing that, it was too expensive to pursue it.

And there have been situations that I've been in the past where I did get a lawyer involved. what you need to do personally, and this is what I would recommend, is if you experience betrayal, whether it is from a friend or, , from a friend, or a spouse or a boyfriend or girlfriend or partner, or it is somebody in your business, you've got to ask yourself, , what's my goal here. My number one goal is protect my business, protect my peace, learn this lesson. What's in it for me. Am I trying to fix the person. Am I trying to make them wrong. Am I trying to repair the situation. Am I looking for a gotcha moment. Do I deserve to make this wrong or. Do I need to go after them legally. And then you got to ask yourself, , what do I need to say for closure. And should I do this because it's going to make me feel confident. And there may be a time in your life where you have to hear yourself say out loud to the person that betrayed you, I know what you did. And I will not have you in my life because I will not surround myself with people who do this kind of thing. And I forgive you. I'm sorry. but you're not welcome back in my life as a friend, as a partner, you can just shut the door after that conversation. You can forgive somebody. You can call them out and you don't have to let them back in. You don't have to give them a second chance. And it comes down to what you want out of this. And if your goal is to stay in the relationship, to use this betrayal as the door that needed to get kicked open in order for you to face stuff that's not working. If you do decide to stay in the friendship or the relationship, you have to have a conversation. You have to explain that what they did and that what they're doing is wrong and how their behavior is impacting you.",

And today we are coaching listeners who have experienced betrayal. And unfortunately. As you're learning, this is a topic that I have a lot of experience in. And we were just talking with Jen. And I was explaining the fact that one of the most important steps that you need to take is you've got to start telling yourself a different story about what happened. And here's one, Jen, that I want you to start telling yourself. It happened because he's an asshole who has a lot of trauma. Who doesn't want to face it and who's been avoiding it. And we also know who will likely. Do the same thing to the next person if he doesn't face it now. Because people who avoid. That hard things, the pain they're feeling. Or the trauma that they experienced when they were little. When people use avoidance as a coping mechanism. Guess what they continue to do. To avoid. And again, this is where it comes down to the fact that this betrayal. Has nothing to do with you. And I know that's hard to grasp. I really do. But I want you to start to tell yourself the story that this has nothing to do with me. This has to do with his shit. This has to do with him not having the coping mechanism to face his pain. And this is a wake up call. That's what this is. It has nothing to do with me. I do want to be clear that he is trying to own his crap. It's just me living in my head. And. I know that part of me knows that it's not my fault. That it's not that I'm not good enough. And all of the things that you said. It's just I'm a highly sensitive person. I'm an empath. I'm 88. all of those things. And I just. It's me trying to overcome those things for me. Then let me give you a different interpretation. And a different story.

And she had this flowing gray hair and she had these glasses that were at the tip of her nose and she had a chain on them. And she was reading this paperback book. You sound you're describing the potions professor in Harry Potter. And she may have been actually. But anyway, she looked up from her glasses and I started querying her about magic. And she said, I'm just here babysitting the shop because this is my son's store and he's doing an errand.

And the reason I showed up was one, I had absolutely nothing else to do. Two, she was giving me chocolate chip cookies. those were the two drivers of my interaction with her. But to sort of understand what happened is she apparently had some exposure to Eastern meditation practices. And she taught me, if you will, what is now called a mindfulness practice.

If you can't be present, it's not possible to learn. she recognized this. And she initially taught me, a relaxation technique. And then she taught me the ability to focus or attend. And then probably the most critical thing was she taught me that the negative dialogue that was going on in my head was not truth. And oftentimes, when we tell ourselves we're not good enough, we're not worthy, we don't deserve love, we think there's some truth in that. But we have, as humans, a negativity bias where negative statements have a tendency to stick with us. And this leads oftentimes to rumination. And once you tell yourself, it is not possible, I cannot, that becomes truth. And we create our own limited belief system. And she taught me a technique to respond with positive self-affirmation, but also to not respond to those negative feelings and just let them drift by, but also to constantly encourage, positivity within yourself. And this led me to look at the world in a different way. And the reason I say that is, if you're hypercritical with yourself, you're hypercritical in the lens through which you see the world. And you're very judgmental. And what I tell people is, once I understood what was going on in my own head, it made me look at the world through a different lens, one of kindness, compassion.

And this is when you give yourself these positive affirmations and you say you're worthy, you're good enough, you deserve. And a lot of the negative self-talk comes from where. It comes from the negative self-talk. It comes from the baggage that we carry from our childhoods. And this is what a lot of people don't appreciate. You're manifesting all the time.

And in some ways it's also, you're accepting your shadow self,. All of us have a part of us that we're ashamed of. We're embarrassed about, we've done actions that are horrible sometimes, and you can't push your shadow away. You have to accept it and integrate it into who you are.

That is something you've been telling yourself over and over and just separating that, separating yourself from it is the first step.

You see, I've spent years working with the top business owners and starting my own multi-million dollar business. I've seen firsthand the differences between the people who get respect versus those who get overlooked. these are the five ways to make anyone respect you. First up is the big question. Do you want to be respected or do you want to be liked. I am a natural people pleaser. And I think this shocks people who meet me today because I don't have traditional people pleasing qualities any longer. And that's because I have made active choices for the last decade to not choose to be liked more than I want to be respected. See, when you don't know which one of the two you're going after, you can get confused. Because when you're meeting people and you want to please people, you can end up pleasing the wrong people. And I can honestly say that until my early 20s, I was a little bit more of a person who was a little bit more of a person who was a little bit I always prioritized people liking me and what people thought about me more than choosing the people to respect me. And what happens when you prioritize people liking you is you compromise. You spend time around people who do things that you actually disagree with. But because you want to be liked, not respected, you don't say anything. You don't change the environment. Heaven forbid, you don't correct them. You just keep going on agreeing to things that actually make you feel you're compromising. In order to be respected, the first person who has to respect you is you. when you think about who you spend your time with today, are you making compromises. Are you feeling you have to make people happy or they have to you over the things that you need to do in order to respect yourself. When I first went to college, I wasn't really the partying type. However, the friends that I was hanging out with did to party and they to drink more than I to drink. But I didn't know how to stop spending time with them. I just fell into this role.",

    "text": "Where I would be there, I would always be the sober one, but I was wasting all of my time trying to get them to me or think that I was cool because I was still in the environment. It took me longer than it should have to extract myself from that environment. And not that there's any judgment that I have for people trying to figure their lives out while in college. But I know that for me, I was making decisions at that time based off of what somebody else thought and what somebody else wanted me to do instead of prioritizing the decisions that I knew would allow me to respect. Remember, without respect, your voice just gets drowned out and your authority will be entirely ignored. No matter how friendly or charming you actually are, you have to establish clear boundaries, show competence, communicate with authority to start to earn respect. Number two is next. Consistency over long periods of time creates confidence. It is easy to just go into the gym for a couple of days and you get all excited about it and you buy your cute workout clothes and you're , I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. And you start to think, man, I'm going to finally take control of my health and wellness journey. But if you fast forward two weeks and you're no longer in the gym, your confidence and your ability to stick to your word goes down. That is the exact same thing that happens with the people in your life when you tell them that you are going to show up for them and you are going to make it to dinner and you back out last minute because you don't feel it. You don't want to. You don't feel good. You are not going to build confidence that you are the type of person that does what they say that they're going to do. every decision that you make, whether it's consistent or inconsistent is giving somebody an understanding of how much confidence they can have in you. Now extrapolate this to the work that you do, whether you're a team member, you own a business. When you say that you're going to get something done, do you do it by that time.",

    "text": "When you say that you're going to follow up, do you actually follow up. You see people learn by how you follow up, by how you show up over long periods of time. If they can or can't count on you. I know instantly who I can and can't count on. And the people who I count on are the people who always follow up with me. And if they follow up with me consistently, for six months, if they happen to miss something, I'm not that worried about it because I know by their actions that they are a consistent person. But if they sometimes follow up, sometimes don't follow up, sometimes do what they say they're going to do. Sometimes they don't say what they're going to do. I'm just going to bypass them. And when you bypass somebody in an organization, all of a sudden you start to ask yourself, , why do I need this person. If I'm going to end up having to do their job because they aren't consistent. And yet when you talk to the person, all they want is more opportunity. They want to be trusted with more. They want to handle more. They want to make more money. They want to do big things, but they can't even handle what's in front of them. This is actually why respect doesn't just happen overnight. What is cool about being consistent. It is in your control. If you say that you're going to do something. And what's also cool is you don't have to commit to something. If you have no intention to do it, that's fine too. Next is number three. You have to set clear boundaries. One of the hardest lessons I've had to learn is not just setting boundaries, but it's actually getting other people to respect those boundaries. There's two steps to boundaries. The first is creating them. The second is enforcing them. When it comes to setting boundaries. The first thing that you have to ask yourself is what are you not willing to tolerate in your environment. Pull out a piece of paper, maybe the notes app on your phone and list the types of behaviors that you will not tolerate from people who work with you, who spend time with you, who are friends with you.",

If you want to be a great team member, you would be showing the fact that your team has improved because you are there. The results show if you are somebody who actually deserves respect, the environment around you should improve because you are there. when you look at your environment, you should ask yourself this question. Is my environment better because I am there. If it's not better, if it stays the same, if it's worse because you get on the scene, then what's the point. Nobody should respect you because you don't do anything to make things better. On the contrary to that, if you do show up to an environment and you choose to make it better, you can then point to, hey, all of these things that are positive happened because I was there. And that is why people respect you. Now, I work with team members and business owners each and every day. And the fastest thing that I drive them to is a specific stat. What is the thing that we can measure that you did that you are great at. I think about the social media team. That I work with. They have ridiculous stats now. Why do they have stats. Because they've gotten good at one thing. How do we take video and create compelling messages for people to understand who we are, what we do, and what we're all about. See, those stats that they now have are actually in the physical universe. It's not just that they happen to be good at social media. There are social media managers who cannot produce a single great piece of content that people actually want to watch. The difference between somebody who's average and somebody who's great is the stats. But. The fastest way to get confused is to think that you have to be good at social media at the exact same time that you have to be good at PR.",

That creates confidence, which ultimately leads people to respect you. To contrast my current social team compared to previous team members that I've worked with. I will never forget. When one of my team members came in my office and she said, the two of us are overwhelmed. We're overworked. There's no way that we can create more content. It's performing as best as it can. And it's just going to take time for it to perform. , fast forward. It was just her that wasn't performing because she didn't actually study the craft. She never decided that I'm going to be great to fully understand what is working on social now. Not what's working five years ago. Not what worked two years ago. But what is actually working now to drive engagement, to create spectacular content. And we've changed up our team. And it's fascinating that all of a sudden this growth has happened. All because our team is dedicated to picking one thing that they are great at. how does this apply to you. You pick one thing that you want to master and you go after that thing for the next 18 months or until you get undeniable results in that area. After that, you move on to the next thing that you want to be great at. And when you can show that you can deliver results over and over again. By understanding the areas of your team. And understanding the areas of your interests deeply. Respect becomes automatic. Lastly, number five. Your actions will always speak the loudest. I still don't get the level of respect from people that I would. The trick is to not use someone's lack of respect as a reason for why you should stop trying. When I decided to marry my husband, I was petrified that for the rest of my life, people were just going to look at me as my husband's wife. Where I would be in his shadows.

You are the only one who gets to see how you do or don't show up. do you respect the way that you show up.

And that is completely. Respect is ultimately about your actions and your results. just put in the work. Don't talk about it. Don't complain about people not respecting you. Nobody cares. put your head down. Prove to people over a long period of time that they should respect you because of the results that you are able to drive.

    "text": "If you want to be seen as powerful, respected, and confident, your words have to match your ambition. I've spent years working under executives, becoming one myself, and learning from the most respected people in the room. These are the five communication skills that separate those who get listened to from those who get overlooked. Skill one is a hard one. You have to stop speaking to be liked and instead speak to lead. In our company today, we have over 250 team members, and I get to see day in and day out people who exude confidence and act leaders versus people who accidentally erode their own credibility. And they do this in the simplest of ways. The mindset shift that the people who are successful have is, I am a leader, even if they aren't yet. The mindset that people have versus the mindset of, I am in somebody else's environment, and therefore I have to be less than or smaller or less certain. When you are less certain in your communication, it shows. in order to be more certain, you can do a handful of things to switch up the way that you speak. One of the most important things that you can do is actually mean what you say and only say things that you are certain of. CEOs, leaders, top executives, they have a point of view. They see themselves, they see their life experiences, and they use where they're at in order to frame what their point of view truly is. And they're confident in that frame. If you want to be able to be more certain in your communication, remember that your point of view is important and you are there for a reason. Now, the simple language tweaks on this are as follows. Qualifying your statements by saying, I think or I feel reduces your credibility. Just say what you think or say how you feel. It's obvious through the communication that you were thinking or you were feeling something, but those qualifiers make it seem you are uncertain. consciously practice making these language swaps. instead of saying, I think we should try this, instead say, the best path forward is another example. Instead of saying, I feel this might work, say, here's a strategy that will get us this result.",

    "text": "I'm going to talk about the first step. What is the core knot inside this tangled necklace. Your job as a leader is to unknot many necklaces. The best leaders think of themselves as professional problem solvers. But the reason they're able to solve these problems better than more junior people is simply because they ask more questions. It is not the expectation that everything and you're coming at it from this high vantage point to be able to tell everybody what to do. Oftentimes, you don't know what to do when you're entering that meeting or that problem. It's a new problem. You see great leaders guide conversations by asking powerful and strategic questions. challenge yourself to ask these questions. Instead of what do you think, ask what data supports this decision. And instead of how's it going, ask what's the biggest challenge you're facing now. Instead of can we fix this, ask what would it take to ensure this never happens again. The quality of your questions determine the quality of your decisions. challenge yourself to ask these questions. Ask what data supports this decision. And if , you'll be able to answer them in a way that's going to improve your results. Here's a little trick that my parents taught me in order to become better at asking great questions. When I was growing up, we would play the question game at any sort of social function. The question game meant that little Natalie was supposed to walk up to an adult and ask them three questions. my mom at a social gathering would say, go talk to Mr. Bob. I would walk over to Mr. Bob and my target was to ask Mr. Bob three questions. , it's terrifying talking to adults. When you're young and sometimes it's still terrifying to talk to adults. I had to overcome that fear. But then I also had to ask three questions that kept the conversation engaging. , as a very young kid, I wasn't able to ask super engaging questions. The questions might sound Mr. Bob, I realized that Bobby, your son is going to baseball practice these days. Does he love baseball. And then Mr. Bob's going to answer back. And then by the answer, I'm going to hopefully be able to ask a second question. , oftentimes.",

My mom would say, here are a few other question choices that you could ask Mr. Bob. And she'd make me go walk back to Mr. Bob and ask him the final questions. This practice of getting good at asking questions, keeping the conversation going, understanding what really matters is priceless and an invaluable trait. If you really want to communicate an expert. That brings us to number five. Which is what most people do. Wrong. You have to stop oversharing. I will never forget the first time I had to fire somebody. I was 23 years old and I was coached ahead of time to say a very specific statement that led me to a very specific conclusion to not get into some large debate as to whether or not we were going to fire this team member. And instead of saying what I needed to say, I started over explaining. I started telling them how wonderful they are and how much I liked them and how much of a pleasure it had been to work with them. And I was , , I'm going to go back to this. And then I started talking to them and as I talked more that, I became more and more tense and more and more uncomfortable. I kept saying things that. And instead of successfully firing the person, we just effectively had a nice little touchpoint in the middle of the day. And I had to take another swing at it the next week. It was awkward. It was embarrassing. And it was the exact opposite of what somebody who has confidence and presence would do. When what you're going to say, say it. You say it with grace. You say it with directness. And you are firm. It's not because you don't people. You don't deliver communication. Over explaining is an indicator that you are not confident. When you do speak with confident people, they say things with effect. They have a message. They clearly articulate that message and they don't continue to communicate. I to think of this an airplane. I'm sure you've had an experience where somebody talks and they continue to talk and they continue to talk.",

And what you do is, you're responding to people not agreeing with them. Another thing that people do, is if somebody comes and says, you need to change, what you're doing as a parent, in how you respond to your kids in this area, because you're doing a lot of damage. you don't , that message, it exposes you, and you don't want to look at that area, and you don't want to listen to that message. what do you do. You discount the messenger. you're a jerk, you don't know what you're talking about, look at your kids, they're not perfect. if I can discount the messenger, then I don't have to listen to their message. And then the final one. People with a lot of shame, complex trauma, who don't feel good about themselves, can easily resent when others, who are also on the recovery journey, succeed, get promoted, get asked to do a job, that they weren't asked to do. And now, their way of resenting the success of others, is to tear that person down. 22 purposes, that being negative and critical, filled in the lives of people from complex trauma. How did you do. How many of those, have you used in your life, often without realizing why you do it, or seeing how often you do it. And I hope you see just how big of an issue, it can be. But that takes us to the next thing. Because being negative and critical, operates as a default setting for most from complex trauma, they're often in that state, or that mindset, totally unaware that they're there.

Because he could just bring out his baseball bat and just smack you really good just because you pissed him off that day. That's not what I meant. That's not what I meant. And that was this with an unpredictable anger who lashed out in judgment at times on a whim. And that was the environment that I suspect some of you were raised in. I say to people all the time that I would guess based on what I do here in Manitoba that probably 25 of the people I work with have been given a picture of that. And that is spiritual abuse. Because now what does that narcissist dad do. He says, here's a verse that says you better do what I'm telling you to do or else 's not, not only am I going to judge you, 's going to judge you. now I got on my side, you better be afraid.

The second thing is there are just a few occasions in the where moved in active judgment and he wiped out some people. just to give you a, there's two things I want you to understand with that. The first is, let's say my wife had terrible cancer and she went in yesterday and the surgeon said, what, I should probably cut all of that out, but I'm going to be nice. I don't want to cause her any pain, I'll just put a bandaid over top of it. That's not a loving doctor. A loving doctor would do radical surgery. And the times when you see wipe out people, he's wiping out a cancer that would destroy the earth. That's part one. Part two, when you see the times, and I'm going to give you the three examples, when did wipe it out, what you find it was the last thing he wanted to do, and he only did it when nobody else would listen, when every single person, every single person hardened their heart. in 2 Peter 3 it says this, the is not slow in keeping his promise. Instead, he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish. In other words, the last thing wants to do is judge. That is what he will avoid as long as possible. He wants everybody to come back inside healthy. that is the heart desire of. that's important because 's not up there saying, I'm mad I can't wait to beat somebody up. is up there saying, the last thing I want to do is judge a person.",

Genesis 6, Noah and the flood. basically the story goes, said to Noah, build an ark, get two of all the animals because I'm going to wipe out the world. Why. Because everybody is living, eat, drink and be merry. What does that mean. They're only living to indulge every selfish desire they have. They are no longer loving. This world has become unsafe and destructive because everybody is totally self-centered. And , I have to cut out this cancer. But then he says this, I don't want to. there's a very interesting thing. I don't know if you remember from Sunday school, but we used to get the oldest person in the was one of the quizzes. And it's a guy by the name of Methuselah. And you, that will be on the test, Methuselah. But he lived to be 969 years old. that was the oldest guy that ever lived. You want to know what Methuselah's name means. When he dies, it will come. And if you go through the story, there's a genealogy. And what you find is you go through it, the year Methuselah died, the flood came. When he dies, it will come. But that's interesting to me because he was the oldest guy that ever lived. And it's this saying, I don't want to, saying, I don't want to judge the world yet. what. I'm going to let Methuselah live another year. The next year, I'm going to let Methuselah live another year. And , I'm going to let Methuselah live another year. The next year, I just don't want to judge them yet. I want to give them another chance. I'll let them live another year. And then he lived another year and another year. And what you see in that is is doing everything to prevent having to judge people. He's giving every possible chance. The next time it happens is in Genesis 19, the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, where fire, it said, came down from. I've been to where Sodom and Gomorrah is. There was a huge volcanic eruption, which would have been the fire from , that wiped out the entire city, kind of a Pompeii.",

And , it says this, the said to Abraham, the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great, their grievous, that I'm going to come down and see if what they have done is bad as the outcry that has reached me. Then Abraham says this. He starts to argue with. And it's important to understand that 's if we argue with him. As long as we listen. But he says, will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked. what he's thinking and fearing is you're going to destroy that wickedness. And he says, I'm going to do that. But there's going to be all kinds of people still that want to follow you. Would you come down and wipe out all these people. And I get bothered at times when people say, is coming back tomorrow and he's going to do this judgment. I go, really. There's many people still that I see with open hearts that just haven't heard yet. I don't see them up there ready to come and do that. But that's Abraham's concern. he says, will you spare the people that are still there. There's 50 good people still left. And says, no, if there's 50 people left, I will spare the whole place. Then he says, how about 45. And says, no, I won't judge it. , how about 40. And they go in this argument. How about 30. How about 20. How about 10. And said, if there's 10 people, I will not wipe this out. what he is saying is there was one. , there was one lot. But that's all. I am only wiping it out because there's nobody left with an open heart. If there is anybody left with an open heart more than that lot, I would give them another chance.

Know for certain that for 400 years, your descendants will be strangers in the land. They will be slaves in a country not their own. And that they will be enslaved and mistreated there. Israel was slaves in Egypt for 400 years. In the fourth generation, your descendants will come back here. Why are you taking them out of here, putting them for 400 years in a foreign culture, in a protected bubble. He says this, because the Amorites' wickedness has not reached its full measure. What he is saying is, they're bad now, and if I let you live amongst them, they'd corrupt you. I'm going to take you out to protect you, but the reason I'm doing that is, I don't want to judge them away because I want to keep giving them a chance. , how long are you going to keep giving them a chance. 400 years. Wow, that's a lot of patience. And doesn't wipe that out until he gives them 400 extra years of chance and he puts his people in slavery to take them away from all of that corruption and then he brings them back. those three examples, what you begin to realize is we don't have this angry whose tempers are always flaring.

And they lived in fear of this angry that you had to be careful that you made enough sacrifices to keep them happy. And if you ever broke a rule, you had to run and make a couple sacrifices to get them to not judge you. And comes on the scene and basically, as you read through his teaching, through these eyes that I've given you tonight, see that what he was doing is saying, I want to give you a whole new understanding of. He is not this angry. And he tells the story of the prodigal son. And it's a son who does this. He says, dad, give me my inheritance now. And dads didn't give their inheritance to their children until they died. And what he was saying is, dad, I wish you were dead.

I'm going to do everything I can to break your heart and do it outside of your design. Now the Jews listening to that would think that father is going to be angry at that son. He would never forgive him, never allow him to come back. Because he's going to punish him and he's going to punish him big time. And says, -, -, -. That's not what happened. And he goes out of his way. you have to understand in that time, it was a shame-based culture. And what that meant was a man, especially an older man, never did anything in public that would mess up his image.

He is not saying if you're angry, you're sinning. He's saying that it's possible to be angry and not do anything wrong. there's anger that is wrong and there's anger that isn't wrong. He's making that very clear. what he is saying is this, anger is a powerful emotion. And if you had a crappy childhood, it's going to make you want to do wrong. You can get angry. Just learn how to do with that anger. Then he says in verse 27, anger gives the devil a foothold. And I think what I want you to hear and what he's getting at with that is anger.

Short tempered people do foolish things. Schemers are hated. The point is this. If you give in to your temper, you always regret it. Because you do stuff that you go, what was I thinking. What a fool I am. And you regret it. And then people don't want to be around you. Lack of respect for you. And they begin to hate you. And then the next one. Better a dry crust eaten in peace in a house filled with feasting and conflict. And then I got to give you the next one. Better to dwell in the corner of a house top than in a house shared with a contentious angry person. In other words, you're better to make a little tent on the roof and live there than live in a great big 4,000 square foot house with an angry person. That's how difficult life becomes when you live with that person. And it affects you. And then it's better to have poverty, a dry crust, but have peace in the home, than to have great wealth and nothing but anger. he's making these beautiful contrasts that say, money isn't what gives you the greatest sense of success. It's peace which is controlling anger. If you get that, then you're going to have the family you always wanted. Then you're going to have the respect that you've been wanting. Then you're going to be the person that is capable of healthy relationships. if something is more valuable than money and possessions, it's controlling your emotions in a healthy way. Next one. If someone has a hot temper, let them take the consequences. If you get him out of trouble once, you'll have to do it again. Two things I want you to see there.

They're not going to learn from it. Because anger, the next time it's triggered, is going to pull them quickly in that negative direction, they can't stop it. then what he says is, don't clean up after them.",

You're only putting yourself into a spot where you're going to do it again and again and again. An angry person starts fights. A hot tempered person commits all kinds of sins. In other words, anger is an emotion that leads to all kinds of bad things. it's not just the anger that's the issue. It's all the things that get done while you're angry that are hard to stop and you can't take back and do all the damage. Ecclesiastes, which is about Solomon, we talked about, it says, control your temper for anger labor. It enables you a fool. Have you ever seen an angry person acting out and you roll your eyes and go, how childish. How immature. , very quickly, causes of anger that are given in the. Proverbs, Solomon says, pride leads to conflict. Those who take advice are wise. what he's saying by pride is the person who thinks they're always and always be in conflict. Because they're never willing to look at their own stuff. In their mind it's always everybody else's fault. nothing will get resolved there'll always be conflict. Secondly, a proud person, you can't teach anything. they're never going to want to look at themselves honestly. they're always going to have conflict. Next thing, pride people always put their needs and their desires and their wishes ahead of everybody else. pride makes you inherently selfish. I want my way more than your way. I demand my way. And when you get a person with that kind of pride, they are always in conflict because they got to step on people to get what they want. They got to use people to get what they want. And they create hurt and conflict. pride leads to lots of anger. Next one, James 4 says, what is causing the quarrels and fights among you. Do they come from, don't they come from the evil desires at war within you. Then he explains it. You want what you don't have. you go, my neighbor got a new car. I want a new car.",

And what I said earlier, and Solomon shows in Proverbs, that probably the greatest cause, or trigger of anger, that takes us to the most severe height, is jealousy. he said, anger is cruel and fury is overwhelming.

    "text": "let's move to how do we heal this template. This template that let us survive. This template that got us respect and validation that really seemed to work but now is causing all kinds of problems in our intimate relationships even though we're getting tons of validation still from people outside of our family. let me break it down. What I think is some very basic simple things but important things. Begin by understanding how this developed for you in childhood. Get in touch with that child that was subjugated that had to give up their needs and take care of everybody else and just submit. Just get in touch with what they felt. What it was for them. Really develop that in your mind. And then begin to list the ways you do today people pleasing. The ways you sacrifice. You submit. You put your needs aside. List those. Itemize that. you begin to see how much how often it takes place. Then start forming. Sitting down and going what do I. What are my preferences. What are my opinions. In every aspect of life. What kind of movies do I. What kind of foods do I. How do I to use my leisure time. Where am I on the political spectrum. About what do I think about current controversial issues. How do I think about how I use my time. Begin to really define for yourself your needs and your desires. And then make a list. Of what you do or give to others. And what they give to you. How much time do you spend listening to others versus how much time do they listen to you. How much do you sacrifice for others versus how much they sacrifice to you. How much you give of your money. How much you give of your time. How much you give of your resources versus what others do for you. Begin to see accurately. And if it's not close to 50 if it's way out of balance then you really have to look closely at that. Stop behaving passive aggressively. Push yourself to assert yourself. To express your needs. To express your displeasure when your needs are not being considered. When your opinions are not being considered. Now what I would say is start with kind of easy stuff first. Expressing your needs and desires.",

    "text": "Find a way to get out of relationships where you feel trapped. That yes, I got married to somebody, but it's totally one-sided. They're not willing to change. Find a way to get out of that. Practice confronting people. Asserting yourself instead of constantly just accommodating. And that means learning to express your anger appropriately. Learning to express away that you're not comfortable, that you're upset, that you feel used, that you're hurt. Do all of that away. And that's going to take a while to learn to do that. But practice learning to do that. But then stop your tendencies. Stop your tendency to rationalize accommodating people, people-pleasing, avoiding getting people angry with you. Stop telling yourself that it doesn't matter, that you're just being kind and loving. Start looking more accurately at what really is happening and get away from those self-delusional lies. Some people find it helpful to review all their past relationships and begin to see their pattern of choosing either controlling or needy partners. From looking back at your past relationships, start noticing and writing down the danger signals that you should have seen and avoided. that now you can see them in potential partners, in potential relationships, and avoid them. start looking for signs of selfishness. Signs of narcissism. Signs of irresponsibility. Signs of over-dependence. All of those are going to generate a high sense of chemistry. Oh, this person feels. It feels good. But actually, it's because it resonates with an old, unhealthy template. And identify the warning signs that you can avoid just following the oxytocin chemistry feeling. the bottom line is when you find a partner, begin to express your needs and opinions up front in the relationship. You want to, from day one, make sure your needs matter just as much as their needs. Your opinions and your values need equal consideration to their opinions and their values. And if you begin to see that this relationship is not a 50-50 of equals, in meeting needs and respecting each other's opinions and values, then time to get out. But if you find this person does respect you, there is an equal giving and taking, be willing to give the relationship a chance. Don't sabotage it you might have done in the past. I hope you realize that this people-pleasing life trap is a real one. A really, really big one.",

I have been hurt too many times. And that's what happens to people with complex trauma. They come into recovery and you go, it's safe here now. You can be authentic. Nope, not going to try. Hey, we work by a different set of rules and a different set of consequences here. You can get hope again. Nope, not even going to try to get hope because I always get hurt. Let's just sabotage everything. And complex trauma just messes that up. The next thing that comes out of this training is what's happening when you're training something is the brain is creating a brain circuit. think of learning to throw a ball, learning to write a book, learning to write a book, learning to write a book, there's many different steps, parts to throwing a ball, pieces to the process, same as riding a bike. And when you first start to do it, you feel uncoordinated. You can't get it. It's just a disaster. You fall, you fail because there's many pieces to get coordinated together smoothly. it requires intense practice, intense concentration, intense practice to get it. And this is what's happening when you're training something. You have to do it over and over and over again until the brain gradually begins to piece together all of the different pieces and how to make them flow together. And it keeps working on it. And as it's doing it, it's developing a circuit in the brain that's getting this refined, that's getting this fine-tuned. And then once you've practiced it to such a point, you can start to do it again. it's a very, very difficult thing to do. And when you're training something, you have to do it without even thinking about it. It just, the brain now goes from this being a conscious, focused activity to something you can do subconsciously. You can do it and you can be talking to others and you can ride a bike because you can do it subconsciously, autopilot. what I want you to understand is this.",

And they can sometimes play in their mind, that person said hi to me today. They must be in love with me. And they can just start playing with that in their mind and developing a fantasy that everybody loves them because everybody said hi to them. And that's where they go. I said, they have an insatiable appetite for attention, praise, and admiration. They always are looking for a pat on the back for validation. Now I'm not saying you should never give people a pat on the back, because we should. That's part of being healthy. You validate people on what they're doing. A narcissist just wants it constantly. They're always looking for it. And then in their own mind, they think everybody's jealous of them. They think everybody wishes they could be them. And that, again, is in their own deluded fantasies. A key thing to understand about narcissists is they're all about image. they don't feel good enough inside, but they'll never admit that. they base all of their value on their image. their focus is looking good. they do that through a couple things. They associate with a high status person. if you're a very good-looking woman and you've been with a narcissist, at some point you've wondered, I think I'm just a trophy on his arm. That he wants me on his arm because I make him look good. He doesn't really care about me. He just cares that I make him look better than if he didn't have me. that's what narcissists do. And then if it's not a woman, then they want to say, I know the president of this, and I know the president of that. And they drop names, and they try to hang out and go for coffee with very influential people because it makes them look good. Then they try to control how you think about them. if they do something that maybe wasn't appropriate, they now will send you emails to explain away what they did and to tell you what you should conclude about them. they put a lot of energy into managing their image and trying to control how other people think of them.",

It's I can be either a puppet on a string or I don't have to do anything will do every single day. I can do everything for me. that's another area of sloppy thinking. I want to try to help you think about that. And again, it's one of those topics in the that we are given some answers to, but there's still an element that we can't quite get our brains around. There's still a mystery element to it. that's what I want you to understand up front is even after I'm done explaining, if I do a perfect job, there's still a part of you that's going to say my brain hurts because I can't quite get that figured out. , let me tackle this whole topic. When we talk about being in control and whether we have free will or not, let me give it to you this way. If was creating us and wanted a relationship with us, do you realize that could have said, I know how to get them all to love me and do what I want and to spend time with me. I'll make them robots. I will give them no free will. I will program them to show me love and to show me kindness. But do you realize that when a robot shows you loving actions, it doesn't feel loving because it's a robot. love only is meaningful if it comes from. If it comes from free will, where it comes from a place where I could love a whole bunch of other things, but I choose to love you. the only way that a meaningful relationship with could happen is if he gave us free will and a whole bunch of options of other things we could love. And then in that environment, we looked at all those options and say, you're more beautiful than all of them. I choose you.",

You find fault somehow with what they're doing even though it is all good.

You get married, live together, you have a relationship, you have a relationship with somebody, you have a relationship with somebody, you get married, live with them for a while, you lose respect. Now they can do the exact same thing they did when they were dating you, but now you see it negatively. Back then you saw it positively. Now you see everything they do through a negative lens. there are all kinds of things that can trigger this kind of mindset today. part of growing and changing, is being aware of your triggers. Being aware of the needs that being negative and critical seem to meet in your life growing up and maybe your brain still thinks meets today. But what you have to understand from all of that, again, is this is not an innocent problem. It might be easy to try to minimize that it's not doing any damage, it's not a big deal. But think with me through about some of the results of living this way. I want you to understand that it brings about a personality. A personality that will always become negative no matter what is happening. I call it the 90-10 pattern. it goes this. Let's say you were to come into a new program. And when you first come into it you go, wow, this is good. And you see 90 of this program is fantastic. And you rave about it to all of your friends. But then you see a couple things that you don't. What do you then obsess about and focus on. The things that you don't. Which might only be 10 of the program. But as you focus on them and obsess on them, what happens. That 10 grows into 90.

And what that means is it doesn't matter what you do, who you're with, what organization, what program you're involved with. If you have a negative critical mindset, you will gradually find negative in everything. And that will add to your discontent. Now for many people, once they start getting negative, especially if they're an addict, it becomes a very dangerous place for them. They can quickly go from negative to hopeless. this is all negative, what's the point. This is all terrible, I might as give up. Throw in the towel. And for many addicts, to get into a negative place in their thinking, often starts the dominoes falling. And I tell many clients that the earlier you can catch that you're becoming negative, the better, because then you can stop it. But once you slide into that negative headspace, I ask clients, how long can you stay there without doing anything to change it. How long can you stay there before you relapse. And for many people in early recovery, one, two, maximum, one, two, maximum, one, two, maximum, three days. And then they're giving up. That's how serious this can be. But it's not just in the context of addictions that it's a serious issue. This negative critical mindset damages relationships tremendously. Especially intimate relationships. what your partner, what your children, close friends, because of your negative critical mindset, they never feel good enough when they're around you. Because you're always pointing out flaws. And they have a hard time being around you, wanting to spend time with you. Because you're just a prickly porcupine. Others are afraid to open up to you about some of their problems or even good stuff happening in their life because you're going to find fault with it. You're going to judge them. And some people will lie to you because they know you'll criticize them if they tell you the truth. now they can't even have an honest relationship with you. And for you to be negative critical all the time makes you a very unsafe person. And if I, without taking you to too much guilt, but I need to just highlight the damage it does to children.",

    "text": "All of the brain cells, the brain research is showing us that children's brains, in order to develop healthy and their whole central nervous system to develop in a healthy way, they need a loving, nurturing environment. That means that they're getting tons of validation. It's a positive, encouraging environment. They need criticism once in a while, but that criticism is given to point them to how they could change and become healthier. It's not just to tear down. It's not to punish. And children, even if they get some criticism, they need to have it balanced out with lots of positives, lots of encouragement. But if you are a negative critical parent, it's very likely that your criticism is going to be more than the value. It's going to be more than the validation your children receive, more than the encouragement that they receive. And that will do great damage to your child. They won't feel they can connect with you. They won't feel safe around you. It creates complex trauma in children because you are not a safe person. There's another result. If you're part of a team or an organization, you're a negative person. Some would refer to you as an energy vampire. whenever there's this dream and lofty goals, you find fault with them all. Whenever there's this new plan that the organization is going to execute and everybody's excited about it, everybody but you is excited about it. And you just suck the wind out of the sails of everybody with a positive goal and a positive idea. And the final negative result is that you really limit your own potential. Because you're afraid to start something, to change, to do new things, because you've got much negative going on in your head. You're looking for excuses to quit stuff before you even start. And you greatly limit your own potential to grow, to be productive, to help others. again, this is such a serious issue. what do we do about it. How do we heal. How do we change this. Start with mindfulness. And what I mean by that is catch yourself. When you catch yourself sliding into being negative and critical about everything, finding fault with everything, be curious about it. And go, what's going on. What's going on here.

And then instead of focusing on all of the flaws and everybody around you, just make a commitment to focus on your own stuff for now. Because it's dangerous for you to get preoccupied with the failures of others. Just focus on your own issues. But then work towards seeing others accurately. that you can learn to trust your gut. And trust your gut again. Look for red flags. You're not doing it to put them down for all the wrong reasons. You're doing it to find safe, healthy people. And what I find with a lot of people, it's hard to know if you're reading the situation accurately when you've been negative for long. have somebody that you trust who's objective that you can say, here's how I see this person. Am I seeing them accurately. Here's how I see this organization. Am I seeing it accurately. Get help in learning how to be an accurate viewer of people and organizations. Then very practically. Start focusing on practicing gratitude, validating people, encouraging people. Now be aware that as you do that, that's going to be totally different from how you've lived for long. it's going to feel weird. It's going to feel awkward, unnatural. You're almost going to feel a bit embarrassed doing that. But get through that. That's. Do it until it becomes something that feels very natural. And then for some of you, you're going to need to set boundaries with negative people. You can't hang around them very often. Because if you spend too much time with them, you find yourself becoming negative. you're going to need some boundaries. For others of you, you might have to stop watching the news for a while or being on social media. Because that just fuels your negativity and your obsession with negative stuff.

Sometimes the consequences are enforced. Sometimes they're not. It really depends on the mood of the authority figure on that day. And that inconsistency is there. But more than that, you can have mom enforce rules one way and dad enforce them another way that children learn how to play mom and dad. But there's an inconsistency there in the two authority figures and how they enforce the rules. The next thing is children begin to realize these rules that dad or mom are enforcing or making, they're not really about what's best for me. It's about what makes their life easier, what's best for them. dad doesn't want people talking at all over supper because he wants to watch the news. And it's silence, silence. Dad doesn't want anybody playing in the house because it's too much noise. And you realize, rules aren't about what my benefit is. It's all about them. And that creates a lot of pain. But more than that, the child begins to think, rules are there to restrict my fun. Rules are there to make life less enjoyable. Rules aren't about what's best for me. Therefore, happiness is found in breaking rules, in stepping outside. In stepping outside of what the restrictions are. And many of you can relate. If you see a sign today that says, wet cement, don't touch, a big part of you just says, I want to touch the cement. And that comes out of the complex trauma. There's the allure of the forbidden.

Will your no mean no. What I have seen happen in many families is the parents would say to a kid wrestling with his sister and punching her and she's crying, and he would say, I told you not to do it, and the child keeps doing it. And then they raise their voice. I said, don't do it. The child keeps doing it. And then they say, I'm going to count to 10, and the child keeps doing it, and the child doesn't stop at 1 or 2 or 3. They know that when mom or dad gets to 9, they're going to go 9 and a quarter, 9 and a half, 9 and 3 quarters, and then the child stops. what you're training your child to do in those instances is that your no doesn't mean no. And they figure out when you finally mean no. And that sets up some very unhealthy dynamics that could cause a lot of danger in that child's life if they were in a big thing, in a big dangerous situation, and you said, no, don't do that, and your no didn't mean no to them, they could go ahead and do it and get hurt badly. learning or training your children that no means no, or first time obedience, is a very important thing, but make sure the boundaries are fair, make sure the consequences are reasonable, and make sure you're prepared to enforce it. What can happen in some families if a child refuses to live by certain boundaries that they know aren't fair, that they know are a double standard, is that the parents then will do everything in their power, to coerce that child to follow the rules of the family, even though the rules might be bad.",

I need to start setting healthy boundaries where I stand up for myself. Where I express my needs. Where I have space to do my own thing and do self care. If you start doing that people in your family are going to feel that you're saying they're bad. And they're going to oppose or give you a hard time and you could end up with a lot of opposition. And they're going to possibly even try to get you to go back to the way things used to be that you live by their rules again. learning to set boundaries in recovery is essential. But it creates a lot of pressure. It creates resistance and opposition from others. Often from those closest to you. be prepared for that and realize I need not just to set boundaries I need to figure out how to enforce those boundaries. And that's what we're going to look at next time. As we come into recovery one of the first boundaries that people learn is I can't hang around with people that are still using. Because that will drag me down. Or if I'm in a relationship and my kid is using or my partner relapses I have to somehow figure out how to handle them because I can't just say no big deal do whatever you want because that will destroy our relationship and it could drag me back down. you early in recovery have to figure out what do you do when people are living in ways that aren't healthy and you're in a relationship with them how do you handle that you don't get severely damaged yourself. when we come to the part that's actually one of the very clear teachings that talks about in the and I think once you begin to see it you're going to go wow this ties in beautifully with what we do in recovery.",

And that's what is going to talk about and it's all about boundaries. he says you do a three step process. number one go privately to the person and point out the offense. If the other person listens and confesses it you've won that person back. You've healed the relationship you've restored it and you've actually grown in the relationship because of it. You might have to rebuild some trust but it's been a very positive thing. let me note there it says go privately. Don't broadcast it all over Facebook about what the person did to hurt you. Don't go behind their back. And gossip to everybody about it. If you really care for that person and there's a closeness in that relationship you go and talk to them privately and try to restore it without anybody else even know what's going on. But what happens if they don't respond to that. You go to part two. But if you are unsuccessful take one or two other people with you and go back again that everything you say may be confirmed by two or three women or two witnesses.",

    "text": "a couple of things there that I want you to see. Some people in unhealthy relationships they want to get their own way and their partner's not going along with their agenda. they recruit two or three people to put pressure on them to do something that the other person wants. But what I want you to understand is they're putting pressure on that person to do something unhealthy. that's the wrong type of what we call triangulation. What we're talking about here is we're getting people who will support us and care about this person who's living unhealthy and we want to put some pressure on them to begin to be healthy again. Very big difference. you take those people and you go and you talk to them. Another piece with that is they can act as witnesses. if the person you're confronting later goes to everybody and says this person said this to me and did this those two or three people can step up and say no, that's not what happened. We were there. And they can prevent a lot of distortions from happening from the parties involved. But what happens when that person still doesn't respond to two or three people. You go to part three. If the person still refuses to listen take your case to the and that is to your surrogate family to your people who are on the same path as you. tell others about it and if he or she won't accept the 's decision treat that person a pagan or a corrupt tax collector. this has often been misunderstood. let me explain it. And I think you'll see the wisdom of it. It's often misunderstood and presented in very much a shunning an excommunication a very severe thing. And I want you just to get the big picture of what's going on. first of all, is not saying appoint yourself the moral police to stick your nose into everybody's business and to tell everybody if they're wrong or not and to always create drama by confronting people. He's not talking about doing that. That is very unhealthy. He's talking about your close relationships and managing those relationships.",

You're fired. You're out of my life after three times. What he saw is though they kept falling into who's the greatest arguments, they were growing in other areas. They were becoming more and more healthy in other areas. That one area they were struggling with more than others. the point is this. We're all in relationships with people and people are in relationships with us and nobody's perfect. plate presentationasse our issues. the goal is not to say be perfect or you're out of my life. The goal is we both are working on our stuff. Not perfectly and we're not going to get it all figured out. But if I see growth in you, I will tolerate a certain amount of messiness. But there will be some things that if you're not changing over time that are going to be deal breakers. And I will have to end this relationship if it gets severe enough. didn't rush to enforce the negative consequences. He went to grace, but he was looking for growth in all kinds of areas. And that is what we need to do. I hope this helps you understand that what we're doing in this whole process of figuring out boundaries with people who are being hurtful is are they willing to change and own their stuff. Or have they hardened their hearts. Have they hardened their hearts. Have they hardened their hearts. And have they hardened their hearts. And have they hardened their hearts.

Therefore, the only way to get love, respect, and get my needs met is by creating an external world that people respect. My image. all the focus then goes. To creating the perfect outward external world that they think people will respect, cause them to them, then cause them to want a relationship with them, then cause them to meet their needs. the image, what they present to the external world now becomes all important. they have to act perfectly. They have to be impressive in how they look, what they own, performance. They got to control. All of their external world in order to get accept acceptance. Then if they have children and many of the clients I work with have experienced this when they went out in public, they had to be dressed to the nines. They had to behave with all the manners. They had to show lots of affection to themselves. But behind closed doors, it was a totally different story. There was anger that it was. It was chaos. But in public, you had to be the perfect family. Because that's how you got respect. the bottom line again is this. People cannot get to know the real me. We got to keep a big part of our life a secret and only let people see what we want them to see, what we can control, what makes us look good. Do you realize that creates constant insecurity, constant fear that this house may be bad. Or do you realize that very rarely do they get the reality. You're a very vulnerable person. And clearly, a lot of the see there. You can're going there and you can make it bad. But as the pequas, people, someone in general, can't get it out there,. And the only way. A lot of you disagree with this. But you go to interior bureau of your office,. begins to feel the need to hide parts of yourself that were rejected. I got to hide my personality. I'm an introvert.

Number 1, have a rigid core belief I'm bad, I'm weak, I'm unlovable, undeserving, inept, unattractive, stupid, powerless, worthless person. Any of those, rate the information. And if you're not, then you're going to have an intensity of that belief in your life. Second one, excessively zealous, defensive, rigid, dogmatic. a couple things with that. If somebody says something to you, how quickly do you become defensive about stuff. How quickly do you take things personally and then get defensive. That's part of that. Secondly is how much are you, it's rigid in your thinking. You only want to look at things one way. Don't mess with my thinking. I don't want to see any other point of view. It's my way or the highway. And you have that very rigid type of thinking inside of you. Or the third part of that is you to take on projects.

What I do to help people with that is I say, you can be very self-centered and never talk about yourself. But if there was a group photo taken and somebody showed you the group photo, who would you look for first. Yourself. That's what that self-centeredness is.

He will not crush the weakest reed or put out a flickering candle. In that culture that was full of meaning. The weakest reed or bruised reed was an illustration from shepherding. if you imagine yourself as a teenager and your dad says, you got to take care of the sheep. , sheep are boring. They eat and sleep, eat, sleep, and they stand there and look at each other. What are you supposed to do all day taking care of the sheep. what a shepherd boy would do was he would make himself a little flute and he would use a reed that was growing in the ditch. And it's much Manitoba. There's reeds everywhere. There are many reeds you can't even sell them. They're that plentiful. They have that little value. a boy would carve out a little flute from a reed and he'd start to play the flute to kind of put in the hours of the day. But because of saliva, the reed would start to break down and pretty soon the flute wouldn't work. you would think, what are you going to do, shepherd boy, with that bruised reed. It's no longer any good. It's used up. It's damaged. The shepherd boy would go, I'll throw it away. There's a million other reeds here. I can cut myself another one. And the thing is, what does do with people who were once able to perform, play music with their life but it become damaged and there's no more music coming out of their soul. Does he say, you're damaged you're useless. I got lots of 7 billion people. I'll just pick another one and use them. No, it says takes the broken, the bruised, the ones that no longer produce music, and he doesn't destroy them but he makes them have music again. That's how he treats the weakest reed. And that is what is saying, is I don't take those outcasts and broken people and say, get out of here, you're useless.",

And again, Manitoba, flax straw is plentiful everywhere. You can't even sell it. There's much. you would make a wick and what would you do when the wick started burning down and sputtering. You'd throw it out and get another piece. And the point was this, what does do with lives that no longer produce light. That are sputtering. The light is dying. The light has gone out. Does he throw it out and say, you're useless. No, he trims that wick. He makes it has light again. what I want you to understand is takes people who have tons of shame, people who themselves believe they're useless and no longer able to produce anything of value and he says, I don't believe that lie. Let me show you. I will take your life and I will remake it to be fruitful and productive again. That's the truth wants us to get. Next one. I love this one. Deuteronomy 32, it says this, He found them, that's Israel, but you can put your name in there, in a desert land, empty land, howling wasteland, nothing's growing, no fruit, no vegetables. It is desert. It is dead. He surrounded this person that he found in this barren desert place that if they weren't rescued quickly they would die. And he found them and he surrounded them and he watched over them and then he says, he guarded them as he would guard them and he said, guard his own eyes. Do you realize that your eye is the organ that is visible. All your other organs are hidden and protected behind ribs and stuff that. Your eyes are exposed, but you have five different things that are built to protect your eyes. You have eyebrows, you have eyelashes, you have eyelids, you have tears that flow and you have instant reflexes if somebody comes near your eye. And what is he saying. Your eye is the most protected part of your exposed body.",

And then the next verse says, an eagle that rouses her chicks and hovers over her young, spreads his wings to take them up and carried them safely on his pinions. I've told you this story before. I love it. And it's all about eagles. Eagles, if you ever notice, their nests are always very, very high. And that's because eagles do not have any instinct naturally to fly. a baby eagle does not have an instinct to flap his wings and begin to fly. How do they learn to fly. Mom pushes them out of the nest. And they go, I have the meanest mom in the world as they're tumbling to the ground. Guess what does to help us grow. He says, I think you're ready to fly. Push. , you're mean. I hate you. And the first time, what an eagle does with their great big wings, and this is what this verse is saying, the mother sees their baby tumbling along, falling, and it swoops down and spreads itself under the baby eagle and it lands on the mother's wings. And it swoops it back up to the nest. What it is saying is, it might look at times that puts you in danger and doesn't care. Don't believe that. That's a lie. He's that mother eagle. And he'll swoop down and he will be there for you. But you got to understand what happens next. You get back up to the nest. He goes,. Out you go again. And then the next time down, the eagle puts his wings out and all of a sudden the wind catches them and they go, whoo, this. And they get the idea of flying. And pretty soon they go, I have the smartest mom in the world. I'm glad she pushed me out of that nest. And that's what does. Next one.

Do you ever stop and think about where do you naturally carry a child next to your heart. And what do little children learn. They can learn to hear your heartbeat. And when talks about carrying us, he's carrying us close to his heart. He goes on and says this, let the beloved of the rest secure in him. He shields him all day long and the one the loves rests between his shoulders. Now you can take that two ways. Number one, your head goes here between his shoulders. He carries you next to his heart or he carries you at times on his shoulders when you're too weak to walk. When I was going through my darkest valley, somebody gave me that verse. And that verse became my favorite verse for a long time. That was carrying me and letting me rest between his shoulders. The verse that helped me the most before that was the next one, Isaiah 41. Don't be afraid for I am with you. Don't be discouraged for I am your. I will strengthen you. I will help you. I will hold you up with my victorious hand.

I will be a really bad kid. And if that causes them to be fully present to me and give me their full attention, they will connect with me. That is better than nothing.

It's for your own benefit to finally be able to see accurately, to validate, to give voice to that. What I would suggest is to do that, but then have a therapist help you then walk through it.

That creates a ton of fear. That creates great insecurity. And what happens for many people is, and this is what sometimes gets classified as a midlife crisis, is all of a sudden they are running around getting cosmetic surgery. They're putting tons of time and effort into exercising, into getting lotions, and all kinds of different. different things to try and prevent the aging of their body. Because they are in great fear of losing what gives them value. Because in their mind, once they've lost their beauty and their body, they are a zero. They have no value. Think of a person whose all their values come out of performance, their job. They're very good at what they do. It gets them respect. It gets them all their needs met. Now they're coming. they're coming up on retirement. And all of a sudden they have this tremendous insecurity. What's going to happen to me. Who am I. Do I have any value now. Will anybody respect me anymore. Will anybody want to be my friend anymore. The same fear kicks in. Or think of a person who's gained all their value from their money and their possessions. But then a hurricane hits. And they lose their home. They lose their home. They lose their business. And all of a sudden, all of the things that gave them value are threatened. They've lost their money. Or let's say the economy crashes. And they lose their money. They have to declare bankruptcy. That creates tremendous fear. Who then am I. What value do I have. most people don't realize that they're in a state of fear. They don't realize that they have this fear until something is threatened. Something that they were depending on to give them value. they start aging. Or they're approaching retirement. Or there's a natural disaster. Or the economy crashes. But it could also be they're in a car accident. Or they have some other health problems. Or some other type of accident. And all of a sudden they're disabled. All of a sudden it affects their mental health.",

    "text": "A happy and fulfilling relationship requires having common interests. And again, we're initially attracted to a person because of the external package and because we share common interests. That's the starting point. Common interests have a place, but common interests don't keep a relationship together. if you're in a relationship that's not love, you can have very different interests. But if you have common interests in core areas, your deepest beliefs and commitments, you can have a wonderful relationship. just having both an interest in the same kind of music and sports or whatever, that doesn't guarantee a healthy relationship. It's common interests around core issues. Number 11. There's one person in the world that's not love. And that's a person that's not love. And that's a person that's not love. There's a person out there who's meant for me. And this comes out of people who basically think there's this cosmic plan for my life. Mr. Perfect's out there waiting for me, and I just have to find them. And connected to that is the next one, which is these people often saying that if I follow , he will lead me to this person who was made just for me. And once I meet this Mr. Perfect, who was made for me, who's part of the plan for my life, then everything will magically just work out. And if a relationship was meant to be, it's part of 's plan, the cosmic plan, it magically just works out. And again, the assumption is that the success of a relationship is dependent on leading you to the person. It's not dependent on are you able to connect and be authentic and to be authentic. It's not dependent on how you communicate and how you're able to be vulnerable and to communicate and to trust and all the things we talked about. It somehow magically will just happen if you find this magic person. Some add to it, I met this person by the weirdest coincidence. it's the universe dropped them into my lap. they must be the person for me. It must be 's will. It's going to magically work. Again, it's fantasy thinking. It's magic thinking. The next one is when I find my soulmate, I will feel complete. I've heard people say this, they meet a girl, let's say, and they go, what, I'm a puzzle.",

Do I tell them about kind of in gritty detail about all of the cheating that I've done and sleeping around that I've done and sexual escapades that I've done. And I go, I'm not sure you need to go in all the gritty detail. You need to be able to say in general terms, hey, I'm not proud of a lot of the stuff I've done in the past. I'm not going to go into details on it. And if they try to force you to details, that's their insecurities. That's them setting it up for this relationship to fail. But you may need to be able to tell them about all of the cheating that I've done. You may need to be able to say, hey, I got to talk to you about some of the stuff from my past, about the sexual abuse, about some of my behaviors in my teens and 20s sexually, whatever, about some of my control issues. And you need to do that to grow in honesty and intimacy in the relationship and trust in the relationship. You don't want to hide. You don't want secrets, even general secrets. But to open up about those areas, you need to be able to say, hey, I'm not proud of a lot of the stuff I've done in the past. And if they try to force you to do that, you need to be able to say, hey, I'm not proud of a lot of the stuff I've done in the past. That can create a ton of fear. Because if they find this out about me, they might run. They might abandon me. They might end the relationship. That shame that's being triggered with that. be aware that the longer you put off talking about some of this stuff, they're probably going to figure it out eventually. They're probably sensing that you're holding something back and they're going to start to wonder, what are they holding back. Is something going on. And they're going to jump to their own feet.",

And the hope is, if I change, it must be my fault. If I change, if I do something differently, then my parents will meet my needs. there's a little graph there where the child, their need isn't met. They go, if I change, then my need will get met, and they have hope. And they start to go down the change road with the hope road, and it might look , oh, it's going to work, it's going to work, but then their need doesn't get met. what has happened. There are two dynamics. Their need is not met, that hurts. Their hope is dashed, and that hurts. they have two sources of pain. Now, but children have this tremendous capacity to hope. where their brain goes next is, oh, if I just tried this thing, then I'll get my need met. And they hope again, and away they go. And they pursue this new option with great hope. And then that option backfires. their need doesn't get met, their hopes get dashed. But children have tremendous capacity to hope. they come up with another option, and they have, oh, hope that it's going to work. What we have seen is that a child would do that for year after year after year, continue to hope, continue to come up with new options. And then around 10 to 12, 13 years old, something in the brain goes, what, I'm getting tired of getting my hopes up and having them dashed. That hurts a lot. Nothing seems to be working. It's really feeling hopeless. It feels there's nothing. It feels there's nothing. It feels there's not nothing. It feels there's nothing. It feels there's nothing. It feels there's not a solution. I'm not going to get my hopes up again. Because to have my hopes dashed actually hurts more than not having my needs met. they stop hoping. And that's when many children go into drugs, alcohol, into very hardened, maladaptive behaviors, because I'm not even going to try anymore. I'm just going to live for instant pleasure, however I can get it. they come into recovery. And what is recovery based on. There's hope that you can heal.",

Where's my head at. What's my mental health. What are the main emotions I'm feeling now. you keep track of if the stress is building. If your head space is still good. develop those inventories. And then if you go my head space isn't good. What do I need to do about it. If my stress is building. What do I need to do about it. And then you go to curiosity. when you find yourself triggered. You go what was that about. instead of getting down on yourself. That you were triggered. And you went back to some maybe some old behaviors. You go. What's going on here. Oh that's connected to that. Now I know what I need to do. understand this. A trigger today. Points to an unhealed wound from the past. And that's what you're going to do. A trigger is actually a sign on the road. With an arrow that says you need to go here. And do some work. And some healing. And develop that curiosity about yourself. About what's happening. What's this trigger all about. And you can learn and grow from it. Let me end by just saying this. Dr. Bruce Perry went to New Zealand. And met with the Maori indigenous people. And he said. I'm going to do something. I'm going to do something. I'm going to do something. I'm going to do something. And they wanted him as a consultant. To talk about healing methods for trauma. And just healing in general. After he spent a week with them. They talked to him. And what they said to him. Was impactful. For him. And it validates and reinforces much of what I teach. But what they said to him was this. You guys in the west. You guys in the west. You guys in the west. You have developed. Two things. You can diagnose illnesses. You can diagnose mental health problems. You can diagnose mental health problems.",

Another danger for many people is I just need to talk to them and have them validate that what they did to me was wrong, that they did hurt me, that it's their problem, that they're the one that needs to change, that I am working on myself. I am growing. I need them to validate all of that. I need that conversation. No, you don't. And if you try, it never hardly ever works. They will just use that to manipulate you. They'll use that to confuse your thinking. They'll use that to gain power in your thinking again. don't go there. Don't give them an opportunity to try and distort your thinking again. what do we do to heal. Again, treat this an addiction. with an addiction, a person that's been in hard drugs, they don't go to casually using again. They got to go to abstinence. And when they get a craving, they can't feed that craving in their mind. They can't play with it in their mind. And you got to go to abstinence from this person. And when you get thoughts and feelings, don't feed them. You got to just break that bond by action and not feed it at all. But then you got to connect to help them. And that's what I'm talking about. And that's what I'm talking about. You got to build healthy stuff. You got to build healthy connections with healthy people, with healthy activities, with beauty, things that create, begin to meet your needs in healthy ways that feed your soul. That becomes a key part of breaking an addiction trauma bond. be aware that cravings will come. That doesn't make it bad that you're failing. That's your brain is still going back. Back to old solutions. It's not confident yet in the new solutions. Over time, that's going to change. But be aware that's going to happen. And this is where I'd say most people need help. Find a program, a therapist who understands addiction and trauma bonding, who can help you walk through those very difficult times. But let me take it even further. The trauma bonding stuff that you're going through today, you need help. You need help. You need help. You need help. You need help. You need help.",

On the surface, it's kind of a paradox. The stuff that you do to lead to true Zoe life, doesn't look it'll lead to true Zoe life. Especially if you're coming out of complex trauma. Because when you are living Zoe life, here's what you're committing yourself to. You're committing yourself to putting boundaries on your life. Constraints.

I want to do certain things every day to enable that to happen. I want to now balance self care with loving others. you. You are changing the priorities of your life.

    "text": "go into some of the ramifications of the solutions the brain comes up with the brain develops solutions that it thinks are going to fix the problem but it's limbic brain stuff it just makes things feel a little bit better but it makes things worse in the long run here are some of the very early adaptations or solutions the brain proposes for the shame thing how to get love and respect but remain hidden number one never be vulnerable never be authentic never let people see the parts of you that would make you weak don't let them see you cry because then they might look down on you don't let them see you sad because then they might think less of you now you have to hide those weak emotions not just your personality but those emotions that can creep out and then once there are people might think less of you that's the first solution with that you then put on mass they can't see the real me I need to present to them something that they will or respect I have to do an act or a role that they will say wow I that person I want to be with her that person and you become a mask wearer some of you relate to being a chameleon you wear a mask a different mask for each person you meet how to adjust your behavior to get this person to you and how to make a different adjustment to get this person to you're very good at wearing masks we teach about the roles that children develop as they grow up you talk about the hero and the jester and the invisible child and the scapegoat child i want you to think those about those roles in terms of shame because one of the purposes of those roles is not just to help the family have less pain it's to provide a solution to shame the hero child says they can't see the real me mom and dad because they will reject me they will neglect me i will be a hero i will be super responsible i will never cause problems i will do extra chores i will be cooperative with everything they want i will never rebel i will help out then mom and dad will love me and respect me the child is trying to get love and respect within the family while hiding what they think are defects the second child is that invisible child that says i don't want to be a burden to mom and dad that's why they don't me that's why they abuse me and neglect me i will have zero needs i will never ask for anything i will never share with them my dreams or desires or wants because then i might be a burden i have to somehow fade into the wallpaper and then i'm going to be a burden and have zero needs or desires then maybe mom and dad will say that's a good kid and they will respect me and love me still trying to solve shame then the jester child or the comedian says i will hide behind humor people won't see the real me mom and dad will never see the sad parts of me the parts of me that are painful and might be a burden to them laugh all the time I'll make them they're always wanting to be with me and have me around because I just make life fun and enjoyable and everybody's happy trying to solve their shame that is one way to look at the roles another thing that happens naturally in the brain is this if I am perfect people will love me and respect me if I please everybody people will love me and respect me I won't let them see the real me I will just be a perfectionist or people pleaser and then I'll get the love and the respect that I long for and you see the flaw in this you get immediate love and respect but what goes on in your head you go you're being a phony if they knew the real you they would have been a fool if they knew the real you they would have been a fool and be loving you and respect you this whole thing is getting you love and respect and it feels good but it doesn't satisfy because it's an act and that becomes the problems of this another solution the brain proposes is I must lie about who I really am I must lie about things that I do that I think might get me judged I must keep secrets about struggles I have and I must keep secrets about the things that I do that I think might get me judged I must keep secrets about struggles I have and I must keep secrets about struggles I have failures I have because I have to hide and to hide effectively I have to become a good liar and I have to become a good secret keeper again you can see that might work in getting people to you and respect you but it sure isn't going to make a healthy relationship down the road if you keep lying and keeping secrets all the time it's gonna backfire sooner or later other people say I will build walls around my heart some people isolate geographically who wants to risk relationships with people when you got shame because you they're gonna find you out eventually I'm not even gonna go there I'm gonna have zero relationships I'm gonna become an isolator some do that not many but some do others say I want to be with people but I'm gonna isolate by creating walls and what they do is they let you in a little bit but then you can just feel you bump into a wall and they're not gonna let anything further about them they're not gonna let the relationship go any deeper you can bang your head against that wall all you want but they are not going to let you in they're isolating behind walls others say my internal world is shame I'm not valuable I'm not good enough all of those things let's just make it a little bit more personal and let's just make it a little bit more personal and let's just make it a little bit more personal and make it better all I'm really not interested in it tough My first step is to design a just perfect here in other words all of those things let's just get going do something that you're proud of what works is to have six Lub brains that you partner with and better you can maybe to want a wasn't gonna help you choose it either way its was it was sevenambient human being with these set a last question and six Gods in the world is the human soul that you

If they prove to be trustworthy there, you trust them in a little bit more. You gradually build trust over time. As they prove to be trustworthy, the evidence has nothing to do with it. The evidence has nothing to do with the limbic brain. The evidence shows that this person can be relied upon. it's a gradual process over time where you trust a little, a little bit more, a little bit more. Until you get to a point where you go, I think I can trust this person with my life. There's another piece though to this that is important for people from complex trauma to understand.",

    "text": "Most people from complex trauma stop trusting others. But they also stop trusting themselves. what has happened once they started getting into adult life is they started making bad decisions because of all their maladaptations. They didn't meet their own needs. They let people down. They didn't make good decisions in life. They didn't keep their promises to people. they broke trust with themselves over and over again. They convinced themselves that they weren't trustworthy. That others shouldn't trust them because they would lead them astray. They would give them bad advice, make bad decisions. And it led them to an internal critic that just said, you are totally untrustworthy. And they just don't trust themselves at all. And an important part of recovery is rebuilding trust with yourself. And I think for many, before you can even start trusting others, a good starting point is to start to be able to trust yourself. just a couple things about that. To me, a lot of people don't trust themselves, want to trust themselves, but they set unrealistic standards that they got to do everything perfectly. They got to not be human basically. And what you have to realize is to be trustworthy, I got to set realistic standards. I got to set realistic goals. And I might have a hundred different goals, but I can't do them all in one day. I got to start with just one goal. And I'm going to get up at six in the morning and I'm going to consistently do that. I am going to then spend some time doing yoga, meditation, go for a walk, whatever. But you gradually build new habits, new routine that is healthy, that meets your 12 needs, and you stick to it. Now the key with it is you can't let your limbic muscles, your limbic brain be in charge because your limbic brain is only going to get up at six in the morning, do yoga, go for a walk if it feels it. You have to get the cortex as the control center of your life that I'm going to do this because it's , not because I feel it. I'm going to do this because it's healthy and I'm going to do it every day regardless of how I feel.",

    "text": "the first is if you look at the diagram, when a child is an infant, they have zero control. Their parents have 100 control because they have to meet all the child's needs. The goal though of parenting is that when the child reaches 20, the child will be able to have 100 control. They have 100 control of their life and their parents can just let them go out into the world, have zero control. what you see there is there's going to be over the course of the 20 years of the child's life at home, a gradual giving up of power by the parents of control and giving the child more and more autonomy to make their own decisions. And if the parents have connected, if the parents are meeting the child's needs, the child will make more and more decisions that are good decisions. But what happens if you get a parent who doesn't want their child to make a bad decision. It could be because of their own past that they haven't fully dealt with. They made a lot of bad decisions. It could be because of their own shame issues. They want to look good, image issues. They don't want their child to make them look bad. They don't want their child to go through any pain. they try to control the child and they exercise control beyond what they should. They don't let the child start making decisions. what does the child do. The child pushes back. The child defies. It's a good defiance. It's a good pushback. It's saying, hey, give me room to grow up. But what does this parent then do when they sense their child is pushing back, their child is rebelling against their overly controlling ways. Often the parent is not. The parent tries to control even more. And that then leads to the child pushing back even more. now you've got a growing distance. the parent's trying to control more. The child pushes back even more. And it easily gets to the place where the child goes, whatever the parent tells me to do, I'm doing the opposite. It no longer matters if the parent is giving them good advice, good counsel. That's not the issue, the advice. It's coming from my parent. And my parent, all they want to do is control me.",

    "text": "I will not allow them to control me regardless of what their advice is. I will do the opposite. That is oppositional defiance disorder. The problem with that is when they get to adult life and they encounter somebody in an authority position who gives them advice or gives them instruction, it immediately triggers, I will do the opposite. If it's an authority, they're trying to control me. And it's only trying to hurt me and restrict me. It's only bad. I will do the opposite. they no longer give any consideration to is this advice wise or not. The only consideration is it from an authority. If it is, I will do the opposite. as a result, you can see that this person now could be rejecting very wise counsel and doing something that's very hurtful for themself. Just because they just have to rebel because they assume that all authority is only trying to control them and hurt them. And recovery for people with oppositional defiance is when you're with authorities and they give you advice or instruction and you get triggered, get yourself back into your cortex. Do not just have a knee in your back. Knee jerk reaction. But evaluate is this wise advice or not. Because not all authority is trying to control me. Some authority has my best in mind. That is really challenging but it is really important to begin to be able to do that. Otherwise, you just have reactive decisions all the time that often are bad. There's another reason why oppositional defiance takes place. And that is children growing up with complex trauma families, parents with double standards where dad can swear nobody else can, dad can be angry nobody else can, they just see hypocrisy. They see parents that talk one thing but live a different thing. That's very unhealthy. That's very unkind. Parents that say they love them but aren't meeting their needs. And they're just rebelling against the hypocrisy. That's actually a healthy rebellion. I do not want to be that. I do not want to connect to that. I want to make a statement that is wrong. And that's what a child does. But again, that can progress and kind of become a deep-seated maladaptation in the child.",

But realize that you have to gradually learn to let go of control, trust others, work with others, allow others to be themselves. The next characteristic, or the final characteristic, and you see that we got to 87, is they're more aware of the needs of others than of their own needs. what happens to the child who's in complex trauma and they're too little to fight or flight. They still need mom and dad to meet their needs, even though mom and dad are hurting them and neglecting them. They basically go to, they need to learn to fawn. And that's what we call the fourth F. And , fawning basically is the child now must become very attuned to mom and dad's needs, moods, thinkings, beliefs, values. They must be fully aware of where mom and dad are at all the time. they have this radar. That is highly attuned to mom and dad, to what they're thinking, feeling, any change in their mood, any change in their behavior. And the child develops this heightened attunement to everybody else. That then leads to them becoming a chameleon. now, I will be an extension of what mom and dad want me to be. I will adopt their beliefs, their values, their thinking. I will reflect on them. I will reflect their moods. If they're upset, I will try to fix their moods. I will be whatever they need me to be to keep them happy. Because if I do that, that gives me the best chance of them not hurting me and of them meeting my needs. But what happens in that is they begin to not be attuned to themself. They don't know what they feel. They don't know what they think. They don't know what their desires, their passions, their emotions are. They just know what everybody else's desires and passions are.",

And 20 years later, their kids are following the same road and end up where they were trying to prevent. People actually create what they fear. fear causes them to try to avoid certain things and try to prevent certain things from happening. But without realizing it, what actually then happens is you create the very thing you're trying to avoid. You create what you fear. Let me give you a couple examples of that. You look at a child who wasn't validated. They hate that they weren't validated. They never want to be not validated. They try hard to be validated. And what actually happens is they end up creating. They end up creating an environment where nobody wants to validate them because they demand a validation. They're always looking for the spotlight. They're always needy. And they're not being validated, created this huge fear of never being validated, created all of these systems to try to get validation. And what happened. They ended up creating an environment where nobody wants to validate them. They created what they feared. Or take a person who was abandoned. They never want to be abandoned again. Because it hurts much. they develop all kinds of systems, which we talked about last time, to not be abandoned again. And what then happens. They get needy. They test people all the time. Everybody gets tired of it and they abandon them. they create what they fear. I have dealt with many clients that said, as a young person, I will never be my dad. I hate my dad. Or I'll never be my mom. And now 20, 30, 40 years later, they go. I'm just my dad. How did that happen. Somehow I created what I feared. Or people coming out of a relationship. I will never end up with another husband or wife the one I just had. And then five years later, they are in another relationship and they go, this is just the last person. Different face, same issues. How did I end up there. why does this happen. first of all, there's a hyper need that comes out of complex trauma.",

I'm not giving you that validation that you need. I'm not giving you that validation that you need. But there's a hyper need to be validated. And this is the reason why you should seek attention all the time. Think of the child that was never heard. They now have a hyper need to be heard. now when they're with people, they over talk. And what happens. People go tired of listening and they stop listening and the child doesn't feel heard again. Or the child who is never understood. They now have a hyper need to be understood. And they over explain everything. And what happens. People get tired of listening. And the child goes, oh, I don't know. I don't know. child feels not understood again. Or the child who felt was made to feel stupid all the time. And now they have this hyper need to be respected for their intelligence. And now every relationship they're in, every situation, they have to give their opinion. They have to let people know how smart they are and people start tuning them out and they are made to feel stupid again. hyper need turns people off. And you end up creating the very thing you're trying to avoid. There's another part to this. what happens for many people in complex trauma is they had to turn off their intuition or their radar systems. think of the child who they're with their uncle. Their gut tells them their uncle's not safe. They try to pull them out of their comfort zone. They try to pull them out of their comfort zone. They try to pull them out of their comfort zone. They try to pull them out of their comfort zone. They try to pull them out of their comfort zone. They try to pull them out of their comfort zone. They try to pull them out of their comfort zone.

All of that's the results of the gaslighting that has taken place by the narcissist for years and now you find you just still have trouble thinking for yourself and believing your own perceptions of things, even trusting your gut. And that leads to difficulty making decisions because your fear of making the wrong decision, your fear that you're not smart enough to make a good decision, your fear you're going to get punished if you make the wrong decision, and then you might have some memory issues that crop up. you have the inability to remember important aspects of what happened over the past years. You might find that you also have difficulty concentrating or focusing. You get a bit of brain fog. All of that becomes part of your existence and then you find times of dissociation where you just zone out. You're just unable to be present in the present. You don't sitting quietly. You want to stay busy. You want to stay distracted. Sitting quietly, that makes stuff too uncomfortable for you. And then there's some behavior indicators. Many begin to want to isolate. It's they just don't want to be around people, either because they're afraid that people are judging them or what they've been saying behind their back, can't look people in the eye, it's just easier to stay away, or they're afraid they're going to get attacked.

That's what they want. they all say, I want to get better. I just don't want to do the work of getting better. here's what I do with clients, this little graph. This is what growth in dealing with shame looks. You make some progress, you get triggered, fall flat on your face. What happens when you fall flat on your face. You walk around and say, I guess I didn't learn anything. I'm stupid. And you feed your own shame and you beat yourself up. Wrong response, but that's the normal response. eventually you pick yourself back up and you start working again and you start making more progress, get triggered, fall flat on your face.

When you have a baby that's getting to that one-year-old mark and they take their first step, do you go, you fell on your face. You're a failure. You should be ashamed of yourself.

And what you're hoping is that over time they'll fall less and less and walk more and more and then they'll eventually run. That's recovery. You are learning a whole new set of skills that is using muscles and abilities and brain circuits that are brand new, that you've never used before. You're not going to get it perfectly the first time. If you don't accept that the journey's this, you're going to beat yourself up and feed your shame every time you fall on your face.

That is a lot of water. And then that gets distributed as fresh water and then it gets distributed as fresh water in rain and snow. the way we get fresh water is not it's magically produced. It comes from salt water in the ocean that evaporates and then creates. there's that beautiful system in place. All of our fresh water ultimately is dependent on the ocean. Sixty chemicals come from the ocean. Many that can't be found anywhere else on land. we're dependent on a lot of that. Fifty percent of the oxygen of the world doesn't come from the Amazon rainforest. It comes from the ocean. It is the biggest supplier of oxygen but it is also the greatest user of carbon dioxide. And do you want to know what's greater than the Amazon forest. It's the underwater kelp forests, seaweed forests of the oceans that take in all the carbon dioxide and release oxygen. the ocean plays a huge role in absorbing our carbon dioxide and providing oxygen for us. Every time a wave crests it releases oxygen from the water into the air. waves become a part of that and then the algae, the plankton, all of those things in the water absorb the carbon dioxide. it keeps us alive. , now this is the fun part. We've talked about all of the water going into the ocean there has to be an evaporation. But I want you to think of something else. If all the water goes into the ocean and nothing goes out of the ocean, what happens when you get water that doesn't have an exit. It gets stagnant. Water that just sits without any movement gets stagnant. What happens with stagnant water. It loses its oxygen and it gets full of diseases. 's got a problem. How in the world is he going to keep this body of water that has no exits from becoming stagnant. Absolutely fascinating. what is one of the things that we use today to filter water.

And then the tide goes the other way, they're going to get washed up on the sand and get filtered. What a great filter system. Who would have thought of that. But pulled that off. And then he put these plants in the water and I talked about the underwater rivers. But what happens is as these underwater rivers hit the mountains, there's mountains bigger than our tallest land mountains, there's mountains bigger than that under the water that are totally buried by water. the rivers hit these and it dries everything up and stirs up. And then every time storms come, they further the filtering process. They stir up stuff that it can get cleaned. All of those things keep the oceans from becoming stagnant, keep them clean, and keep oxygen happening in them. The next piece that has to happen if this is going to work, you got to have plants that can absorb the carbon dioxide and release oxygen. they have to be able to get the sun's rays. water has to be transparent. It can look blue, but the sun has to be able to penetrate it to a depth that the plants can get the benefit of the sun's rays they can grow and do all the important things that they do. , next thing, if you're going to get plants to grow, they need fertilizer.

Fish who need to poop. And now you're fertilizing all of the plants of the ocean in a beautiful way. Sonny, you're just going to let that sink in a little bit. You're going to enjoy that one.

Plants are up close to the top. How do you get that up to the plants. again, those underwater rivers hit the bottom, and they hit the mountains, and they drive all the water to the top. there's this constant cycling of water that takes place thanks to these deep underwater rivers, and then the storm stirs everything up. , now you've got one other problem. Think of science in high school. What are the three different forms of a substance. You have a solid, a liquid, and a gas. Remember that. if you take any substance, solid is the heaviest and the smallest. Once it expands to a liquid, it gets bigger, and once it expands to a gas, it gets bigger. Follow. , now let's take water. If water turned to ice as a solid, and it followed the path of all other solids, it would get heavier and smaller and would sink. What would happen to all the fish in the world if in the winter all the ice sank. We would have no fish. if we're going to have fish stay alive in the winter, 's going to have to do solids, liquids, and gases different with water than with other types of substances. guess what happens when water melts or water freezes. It expands, and it floats. The exact thing necessary to keep fish alive. Now doesn't it take a genius to design a system that. if you want to read Job 26, it goes through creating the universe, the water, the oceans, all of that. And then it says this, these are but a whisper of 's power. Now, I'm not saying that you have to be a genius to do that. But you have to know that 's power is the greatest power. In other words, this is just the smallest little piece of 's power. But then it goes on to say, but the thunder of His power, who can begin to know that. If we can hardly get our minds around a whisper of 's power, just think if we understood perfectly the greatness of 's power, we just wouldn't have a brain that could fathom it.",

What are early indicators that I am disconnecting. Because it happens subconsciously. What can I learn about myself I can catch disconnection sooner than I have before. Because if I disconnect for too long, I am going to be in big trouble. And the earlier I disconnect, the better I can detect that I am disconnecting, the better. this again is all about self-awareness. Somebody has said once a habit has been brought to the conscious level, you have a habit that you just do subconsciously without even realizing it, once it's brought to the conscious level, it is no longer a habit, it is now a choice that you make. look for this. If you realize that you are starting to speed up internally, and what I would say to clients is, most of us have a normal RPM setting. Our engine, our motor runs at a certain RPM. If we are about to go to a social situation or undertake a task, it will speed up to prepare us for that extra activity. And what can happen for a lot of people is if they start speeding up and catch it, they go, why am I speeding up. And then they realize, oh, I got some speed. They realize, oh, I got some stress happening here. And they realize they're starting to disconnect. be aware of speeding up both adrenaline in your thinking and in your activity and in your emotional world, getting more charged up. Very important. Next one. Be aware of times where you are sliding into being a robot.",

    "text": "But you begin to build a relationship with yourself. Now some of you with small children might not be able to do that. The only way that you can have a relationship with yourself might be when you go to bed at night and you finally are in quiet. And that is a big thing for you. But once you have that quiet time, take some time to. Take some time to just meditate on something that you've learned or something that's important for you to be reminded of. Take some time to just connect and take an inventory of what you're feeling, what was tough about today, what was good about today. Be grateful. And then begin to get in touch with, what do I really have a passion for. What is it that makes me get excited and makes me want to get involved in. Get to know yourself. Sometimes when you do that, some people will find it very helpful to journal and begin to write those kind of things down. Another thing that some people might have to do when they get that time in the first minute alone with themselves is do grounding exercises. Calm themselves down. Because it's really easy to say, here's my 15 minutes of quiet time with myself and just rush through it. And just go through the motions and just go through the motions. And then you'll get to the point where you can really connect with yourself. And that's what I'm talking about. And that's why I say, if you're not truly connected, you're not truly connected. you might have to slow yourself down. Something else that might help you is to have somebody in your life that you can talk to about what you're learning about yourself and get their opinion and insights about what they know to be true about you. that's something, we need to learn to be genuine with ourselves because knowing that you are going to be part of us and all the other aspects of us and the other parts of us is the way through healing all manifestations of the physical and emotional body. It is how we experience deeper, more meaningful connection with others and learn how to take care of our own needs moment to moment. Thank you.",

Fear of getting hurt. That's the big fear, because you see, I'm just me. I can't connect with anybody, I'm going to have to do a lot of work. I'm going to constantly be going up against things that are dangerous and bigger than me, I could get hurt physically, emotionally, and I don't want that. there's this constant fear in every situation of getting hurt. How do I avoid it. Next one, fear of failure. You see, in a healthy home, if a child fails, the parents nurture the child, teach the child, and they're going to be able to do a lot of work. I'm going to constantly be going up against things that are dangerous and bigger than me, and I'm going to want to keep trying to do it. I'm going to have to keep trying to do it. I'm going to have to keep trying to do it. the failure, the failure turns into a positive growth experience. What happens in many complex trauma homes is if you fail, then you get made fun of, you get punished, you get disrespected, you get told you're stupid, people are impatient with you, people reject you. failure is not a positive thing.",

They don't even feel emotions. That's alexothymia. And that can happen out of betrayal trauma. Then there's cognitive symptoms of betrayal trauma. And again, if you've been cheated on, etc. What can happen in the days and months that follow is you can have flashbacks and nightmares. You can relive it. And you can be going through your day and all of a sudden have intrusive thoughts. You just start thinking about it. And you didn't even want to think about it.

You're just zombie mode. You're just in the middle of a series of life, but you're not there. For some, there's even a sense of time slows down or even stops. They're just not connected to the present. Others then have trouble making decisions. They don't trust their ability to make decisions anymore.

I don't really believe though I believe it academically that He loves me. I don't let myself feel that He loves me. That's part one. Part two, sadly for many churches that don't understand shame and the effect of shame they provide ways for people to wear masks and hopefully get love and respect from. you can hide the real you just come and serve and keep these rules and do these things then will love you. They don't feel that loved them if they didn't do those things but only if they do those things. the question that I have thought about for years and I think needs a clear answer to shame-based people is it's important to get to the point where you see that loves you as you are. You do not have to perform or do anything. what I wanted to do in the part in this shame series is give you stories that illustrate that. tonight I'm going to tell you a story from the life of King David and we've told a number of stories from him, his life but it's going to be about a guy named Mephibosheth. Now I don't know who would call their kid that but that was his name. I even thought of how could I abbreviate that. I call him Phib. No, that doesn't work. Meph. No, that's too much meth. Bosh. No, that doesn't work. we got Mephibosheth. just to give you the context, David's been king for 20 years and he's established as king. During that 20 years of his reign, the nation of Israel has grown eight or conquered eight nations and grown six times its normal size. it's expanded. And it has just prospered. And he has become basically the richest king in the world and he's got all this territory, etc. it's a time of great popularity, a time of great wealth and prestige.

And that to me is significant because it's almost to their mind that shame takes the color out of life. And it makes it a very dull color where you live in a black and white. It makes it a very low color where you live in a black and white because it's black and white. And it makes it a very low color where you live in a black and white. white, pleasureless world when you have shame. Another characteristic of people with shame, and I will sometimes ask this, is are you able to look yourself in the eye when you look in the mirror. And many people with shame are not able to look at themselves in the eye when they look in the mirror. Some don't even look in a mirror because they can't stand to do that. Others, when they look in the mirror, never look at themselves in the eye. They either look at themselves from the nose down or from the eyebrows up because that is what shame does. You don't yourself because you feel you don't have value. You don't feel good enough. therefore, you don't yourself. , now I take clients to this.

Do people want to be with me. Do people me. What do I have to offer that would make people interested in me. they are asking those questions at a subconscious level.

If you take that to a healthy home, a child growing up with healthy parents, what reflection do they get when they look at mom and dad. They get the constant, consistent message, you have great value. You don't have to do anything. You have value inherent within you. You are lovable and we are committed to unconditional love to you. a child growing up in that environment, they have a positive self-image. They feel good about themselves. They don't have thousands of insecurities because they know who they are. They know their place, their value, all of that. When you come to complex trauma, the mirror says a negative message. In a healthy home, positive messages come from the mirror. Complex trauma, negative messages. I wanna go through a list of things that mom and dad can do or say to you that mom and dad can do or say to you that mom and dad can do or say to you that they can do. , mirror back to you messages about who you are. , and many of you, this is gonna start stirring up memories for you because many of these you will have experienced. Some of you have gone through, you shared your opinion with mom and dad and they laughed at you. In other words, you got the message you're stupid and that was reinforced in a whole bunch of different ways.",

And those were expressed to you on regular basis. Now, some of you have said, mom and dad only said that when they were angry. They didn't say that when they were in a good mood. And what I say to clients is this, if you're really honest, what you're trying to say is that didn't impact me because I knew they were angry. But be honest with yourself. Did it impact you. Yes. Because sometimes when people are angry, you think they take away all their filters and they speak what they really believe. And you believe what they say in anger. And you can see your son calm down. You see your mind useful because you believe in. You see your heart innocent because you only have a fewing thoughts, that long life apart. When they say having anger, you see that they believe in , and all of a sudden, what does that eventually end up with. It leads them to call out their first colours in a very hurtful manner.

I have no money. I have no money. I have no money. I have no value now. parents' value systems are very important in figuring out shame messages. Subtle ones. Do you realize I'm told that about 10 of children have bed wetting problems. After they've been toilet trained, they will still wet their bed at night. What I understand is when you get to addicts, about 20 of addicts had bed wetting problems. And that's because they're not aware of their own problems, even later than just a couple years. And it was a source of great embarrassment, often the source of a lot of shame and ridicule within the house, and that sent a very painful message to the child. Another one is if you grow up in a poor family in a more affluent area, and you go to school and all the kids have new clothes and you're wearing hand-me-downs. All the kids have their latest shoes and the latest cell phones, and you don't even have a cell phone and you're wearing your brother's old shoes with holes in them. You start to feel less than all the time, not just in the family, but in culture in general. If you come from a different ethnic culture, your family moved, let's say, from Syria as a refugee, or your parents came from a different country, or your parents came from the war when you were little and you didn't know English, you didn't know the culture, you didn't dress Canadians, that was a very hard thing and it can send a shame, not good enough message. Final really subtle one is this. We don't have this a lot anymore, but 50 years ago it was not uncommon for families to have 8 to 12 children, some even had up to 15 children, and they were not allowed to wear their clothes. And it was a very painful message to hear. And I think that's what we need to do.",

And it wasn't that mom and dad didn't want to neglect their children, they just had too many kids to give all the attention that those kids needed. And a child can feel neglected. With that, if you grew up with a sibling who was sick, mom and dad give all of their attention to that sick child and you feel neglected. They're not intending to send a shame message, but you're perceiving that you're not good enough. those are all subtle shame messages. Now let me add one more piece,. In a healthy home, parents make a distinction with a child. Number one is who they are, number two is what the child does. a child may do wrong things, a child may do kid things, spilling their milk. And the parent says, regardless of what you do, you are still valuable and we love you for who you are. We might not what you do, but we love you. In a complex trauma family, what happens more frequently is you did something bad, therefore, you are bad. that distinction isn't made between what you do and who you are. And now, we're going to talk about the child. Now, if you grew up in that, as soon as you do something bad in your mind, even if it's spilling your milk, you beat yourself up and go, I'm a loser. And that comes out of that lack of distinction between what I do and who I am. , if that's not bad enough, I'm going to keep going. that was just home life. Oh, I should add one other piece. Another piece to the home life. What can happen in some families is mom and dad aren't the problem, is you have a sibling who's older and stronger than you, and they abuse you, they say cruel things to you, and they say if you ever tell mom and dad, this is going to happen to you. They threaten you. That in itself can send shame messages because now you're in pain. You're getting all of this stuff. Bombarding you and you got to keep it a secret. And it can do its damage. If you go outside of the family, let's go to our culture.",

It was a life commitment. Now you can imagine that the top rabbis wouldn't pick all the students. They only pick the very select, brightest students. there's still a whole bunch of other students that weren't picked. that takes to the second option available, is that the kids graduating, they could go to the other rabbis in their villages and around, and they would go to them and say, could I follow you. In other words, would you consider taking me on as your disciple to train me that I can eventually do what you're doing. they would go to all the other rabbis, and a number of them would get picked, but still not everybody was picked. Only the brightest, and then the next brightest who the rabbis liked. what was the option for the people that weren't picked. They went back to their father's business and worked for their dad.

He picked from the reject pile. there's hope for all of us. But we're not done. He didn't just pick those four fisherman guys. He picked a guy named Matthew. Now Matthew was a tax collector.

And basically you had to get in bed with Rome and pay Rome and give Rome some of your money and engage in Rome's domination of abusing Israel. And if they gave you a license, you could set up your little office on the street corner. what you could do, let's say, you were going to be able to put a tax on the amount of fish that a person caught. But here's what tax collectors did. They were greedy and Rome really didn't care how they abused their own people. they said, I'm going to make a new thing to tax. I'm going to start taxing the number of wheels you have on your cart. you got two wheels. Oh, you got four wheels. You're going to get taxed even more. And then they kept making taxes up that the people of Israel were putting more and more of their profits into paying tax collectors and they were getting poorer and poorer. And there was nothing they could do about it because Rome was supporting these tax collectors. they became the most hated men in Israel, but they were also considered the most dishonest people and the most evil thieves around. Men with zero character, men who had no regard for human beings, total narcissists, total greedy people. they were not allowed to go to. They would have security people saying, not allowed. And they were banned from and religious activities. They were considered untrustworthy and greedy and corrupt that they weren't allowed to testify in court because they could be bought off and give false testimony very easily. they were not allowed there. They were classified as the lowest in society. In fact, they taught that would never forgive a tax collector and that he was happy when tax collectors died. Guess who picked. A tax collector. Somebody that was not supposed to forgive, but forgave. Somebody that was supposed to get happy when they died, but wants them on his team. , next one. Simon the Zealot. In that culture, they had these daggers. And these men, Simon the Zealot, was part of what was known as the group that carried daggers. It was a gang.",

It was when a father presented his son to the world as a man. And he would stand beside his son and he'd say, this is my son. I am very pleased with him. He's dearly loved. And he would put his son on display and they would celebrate it. Now I want you to think about what happened in that culture. If you were a bastard child, if you were born out of wedlock, if your mom had an affair and got pregnant, they would not throw a bar mitzvah for a bastard child. What was considered to be. A bastard child. In John 8, the rumor, we're told the rumor going around is that Mary had an affair with a Roman soldier. That's how she got pregnant because they knew it couldn't have been by Joseph because they knew his character, but she was pregnant. they had to explain it. And they weren't saying the made her pregnant. They're saying she had an affair. That is a bastard child.",

And they're starting to see that crime is going to be the way to do that. Another thing that happens in complex trauma is often the child develops this deep anger and rebellion because life is not fair. Parents are not meeting their needs, but nobody's owning their stuff. they just start to rebel against it. And that can lead some into, I'm going to do crime. That's my way of rebelling against my parents. That's my way of hurting my parents. Part of that. Also, is my life is unfair. I'm angry at it. And then a sense of entitlement develops out of that. The world owes me. The rich owe me. I've been ripped off. Everybody's deprived me, not treated me properly. I deserve a better life and I'm going to grab it. what is important to realize that also sets a person up for this criminal activity is the soul. I'm not an expert on these things and I'm sure you're telling me this but I keep getting angry at it all the time. I don't want to talk too much about that material stuff because every time I listen to these kids I get motivated to do something about it.

That's just kind of what America is but you have to do it differently for yourself. I just want to continue on and then I, all that about your circumstances, about your behavior, because to think honestly about stuff just going to bother your conscience. Then you get into distorted thinking about things, rationale to justify stuff. all of those things are happening in complex trauma and that just sets a person up to be a prime candidate to engage in criminal behavior.",

That takes us to the third level. level one and two, the child tries it. Here's the underlying reasons why they are vulnerable to it. But then they get caught and most quit. But some go back to it. Some continue to do it even though they were caught and there was consequences. What causes a person to go back to it. A bunch of different reasons that you're going to get from people as to why they continue to do criminal behavior. Many of them are going to get caught and most quit. Some continue to do it even though they were caught and there was consequences. But then they get caught and most quit. But some continue to do it even though they were caught and most quit. Some continue to do it even though they were caught and most quit. Many are subconscious. They don't even realize all of it, but they will realize some of it. And number one, probably the most common is there's a rush. They get a rush out of planning it, the suspense of, am I going to be able to pull it off. And then when they do pull it off and not get caught, there's a huge rush. And what I want you to see is that rush medicates all the things that are going to be involved in the process. It makes all the underlying issues, the emptiness, the pain, the shame. It makes them feel better, makes them feel pleasure. And the rush becomes a powerful thing. Secondly, for many, it's fast money. It's a way to get money quickly and lots of it. And then a lifestyle, very instant, wealthy lifestyle. They can live high. That's a huge attraction to keep going back. For some, it becomes their identity. They now have gained respect as the bad boy, as the person who can supply drugs, as the person who can get extra things for people. And that identity is important to them. It's an identity that they think contains a lot of respect. Then for some, it's basically they hang around in a peer group where everybody's doing it. Everybody thinks that the way that they think about crime and justifying it.",

For some, there's a shame element that goes to when they pull off crimes and don't get caught, they feel smarter and better than everybody else. And it really feeds the sense of shame. And it really feeds an egotism that a superior or anything. Others, they do it because they become drug addicts and they just need their drug fix. And the only way to get the money to get their drug fixes to steal some is just pure greed. They just want more and more. They think getting more is the answer. That's still that fantasy thinking that's going to make them happy. And then some, there's a sense of power that comes out of being a criminal that I get to do these things and get away with it. And I can manipulate people and do all of this stuff. There's power that comes out of that. again, what I want you to see is people that go back to it, the criminal activity in their subconscious mind is actually meeting a whole bunch of needs, fixing a whole bunch of needs. bunch of problems. It's fixing emptiness. It's fixing shame. It's gaining them respect. It's gaining them belonging and fitting in. All of those things are being met by criminal activity. And it seems to be a solution, the best way to have a good life. That's where they're coming from. Next thing I want to look at is five addictive criminal stages that happen. first of all, there's something that triggers a desire to go and commit a crime. that trigger, there's maybe a conscious trigger, but there's also a subconscious trigger. There's a deep shame, a deep emptiness, deep pain, all of those things that we talk about, that all of a sudden they think crime is going to be the solution to my deep inner stuff. it starts with something that triggers all of that. Soip Brady, who's written a lot about criminal behavior has said, the destructive and self defeating behavior that criminals experience is not driven by material or economic motives, but is simply individuals trying to enrich their empty shell identities. Then once they're triggered, there's still that initial conscience that says, don't do it.",

Then their fear of getting caught would bother them. Then their desire to be a productive citizen is going to be violated. And then there could have religious beliefs that are getting in the way. you've got all kinds of deterrents that would immediately say don't do that criminal activity. what has to happen in the mind of a criminal is corrosion, which is I got to get rid of every deterrent, I got to corrode it that it gets rusty, and it gets rusty, and basically wears out, wears thin, and then I cut it off. I just block it out of my mind. they go through all kinds of mental gymnastics to get rid of their conscience, to get rid of the fear of getting caught, to get rid of religious sentiments, to get rid of being a productive citizen, and find some way to lessen the intensity of that until the time they can get to a point where they can just block it, where they can cut it off, and it no longer influences their thinking. that is a huge part of what is happening. it's a process. It's not something they instantly just go to, I'm going to commit a crime, let's do it. They got to go through this mental process where they lessen the intensity of the deterrents until they can get to a point where they can just block it, where they can cut it off, and it no longer influences their thinking. that leads to the third stage, and that is now they're going to commit the crime. again, Brady, the actual carrying out of criminal acts demands that criminals neutralize the unsavory aspects of their offenses, which we just talked about, lend meaning to inexplicable behaviors, they got to somehow justify it, make it sound it's good.",

Just a person using drugs and alcohol, there's chemicals released in the brain that cause them to feel good, that cause them to feel very excited, tons of pleasure. And they go back to it every time there's an emptiness, every time there's pain, every time there's emotions they don't want. They now go back to the criminal activity, just a drug addict goes back to the drugs to medicate all of those feelings that usually are in the subconscious realm. And criminal behavior can become an addiction for many people. let me go to the characteristics of a person with criminal behavior. first for many, and you can again, we're going to go about 30 of these, you can check off the ones that might apply to you. But there's very much an instant gratification. And that makes them impulsive, that makes them, they don't think of planning ahead. They don't think of kind of time that's realistic to get a nice house and a nice car and good vacations. They want it now. They want the best. They think they must have the best and they must have it now. it's very much still living out of their limbic brain. We're going to see that over and over again. They want instant gratification, instant pleasure, instant success, instant wealth, all of it now. Then there's this reckless disregard for safety to self or others. risks taking, hurting others, that becomes a key part of their, who they are. Next, consistent irresponsibility. just, they don't want the responsibility of holding down a job, of working hard, of financial obligations. They want to be able to do what they want to do and still kind of have lots of money. And there's an irresponsibility to them. Then a lack of remorse. they do stuff, but then they just justify it. They don't have remorse that results in change. They might have moments of regret or moments of emotions, but not that brings about true change. And then lying. they, lying becomes a way of life. And they have premeditated lying where they plan what they're going to say, but then there's habitual lying.",

I'm a victim of a very awful. Culture of a very awful system. And victim, victim, victim is their mindset, never taking ownership for their behavior. And what comes with that is they say, I can't change. I can't act responsibly. I can't hold down a job. I can't be a consistent father. But at the very same time, they think there's nothing. They can't do anything. They can't do to succeed as a criminal. they use, I can't as an excuse to grow up, to get out of their limbic brain, to become responsible and acting in healthy ways. Often there's a sense of entitlement. If I want it, I need it. they don't distinguish between legitimate needs and want to them. If they want it, they must need it. And if I want it and I need it, I should have it. I deserve as much as someone else who has worked harder than me. People owe me. The world owes me. I have to get my piece before you get yours. I deserve more than others. I deserve things for nothing. The world should suit me, not me suit the world. Things should go my way. Just that very narcissistic entitlement often begins to develop. And then there's a lack of trust. They just don't trust people. And it's partly because they don't trust themselves. They know they're not trustworthy. Now they demand others trust them if they're in a gang, but they don't trust others. There's a double standard. Now, many will temporarily trust somebody, but only if they've got something over them to force that person to be trustworthy. Otherwise they just don't trust. With that, there's a refusal to be dependent. I do everything myself. I'm independent. Dependent. Being dependent to them makes them weak. It makes them vulnerable.

And now they're stealing money from their kids in order to go buy drugs. They're there's this fragmentation. They promise. They're there for their kids and spend the day with their kids. And then all of a sudden they changed their mind and they're out with their buddies doing something. It becomes a huge issue for them. This contradictory internal world where Jekyll and Hyde is happening. And the one that seems to be getting stronger and it's causing them to break commitments to do stuff that violates love. That begins hurting those they love the most. Many. Have a perfectionism. They in a whole bunch of life don't care about perfection at all. But when it comes to doing what they do, they have to do it perfectly. And then there's a suggestibility and it's still this comes out of that shame that need to belong. And if somebody else in their peer group makes a suggestion, we should do this. It has a powerful influence over them. If somebody outside of their group. Says you need to change and makes a suggestion as to how they change. They resist that. But within the group where they want to get accepted, they're very vulnerable to suggestions. Many with criminal behavior are known for deferring or putting things off. And it's kind of in three areas. they keep saying they're going to make the ultimate score, the ultimate crime. But they just. Keep putting off actually doing it. Or I'm going to make the ultimate crime, get the big score. Then I'm going to quit. I'm going to do one more job. Then I'm going to quit. And they just keep putting that off. Keep putting that off. Or I'm going to start becoming more responsible. I'm going to start doing better habits. I'm going to start doing stuff every day and paying my bills, writing this letter, doing my taxes. And they keep putting off becoming responsible. that leads to this failure to assume obligation. the concept of obligation to a person with that criminal mindset. Obligations interfere with what they want to do. Obligations are viewed as a position of weakness and vulnerability to somebody else controlling you.",

And if you try to tell them they need to be obligated to, to their kids, to their job, to a responsible life, they can often get quite angry about that. Because obligations just interfere with what they want to do. again, it's their limbic brain is running the show, wanting to do whatever they want to do, when they want to do it, get instant gratification. And if anybody operates as their cortex and says you need to grow up and become responsible, they get angry about it. they're always looking for. The easy path. Who wants hard work. Who wants obligations. Who wants daily routine. Who wants structure. Who wants habits that you have to do every day. No, they want an easy path where there's not hard work, where they can just have a good life handed to them. And they think that's the path to happiness is the easy path. And part of that is they don't want. To make an effort to endure adversity. They don't want to sit in uncomfortable emotions in hard work and working hard waiting for the benefits to come later. They want to put the seed in the ground and have an instant crop. They don't want to endure waiting for that crop to grow, weeding that crop, watering that crop. They want it now with no adversity and not having to endure. Adversity. And they don't want to expend effort. They don't want to have to go through hardship. They don't want to have to go through obstacles and frustrations. They just want to be instantly a big shot. again, it's the limbic brain instant gratification. The next thing is many people in criminal behavior have never learned how to make good decisions, to become responsible. they don't know how to reason out the pros and cons to go on fact-finding missions to weigh out the costs of something to weigh out the various options available to you. They don't they've never done that. They don't know how to do that. And they're afraid to go ask somebody to teach them because that might make them look stupid. That might make them look they don't know what they're doing. And to save face, they just don't want to ever learn those tools. And they don't want to ever learn those tools.",

And then there's a term that's called alexothymia. And this would come out of a child being betrayed in complex trauma. And it's also called emotional blindness. And it's a neuro-psychological phenomenon characterized by significant challenges in recognizing, expressing, and describing one's own emotions. this is a person who, as a child is betrayed, it's too much to deal with. they just shut down and they don't feel anymore. And then they disconnect from their emotional world and they don't even know how to recognize emotions anymore, they don't know what emotions are, they don't even feel emotions, that's alexothymia. And that can happen out of betrayal trauma. Then there's cognitive symptoms. of betrayal trauma. And again, if you've been cheated on, etc. , what can happen in the days and months that follow is you can have flashbacks and nightmares. You can relive it. And you can be going through your day and all of a sudden have intrusive thoughts. You just start thinking about it and you didn't even want to think about it, but it just intrudes into your thought life. Another thing is that you can begin to have memory issues. you forget stuff, short-term stuff. Other people is deep confusion. And it's almost at an existential level. , what's the purpose of living. Who am I. Do I matter. Who cares about life. All of those questions, deep confusion about where you're going in life, what to do next. It just becomes this very confusing time. And then you can become very difficult to concentrate. And you get distracted easily. You just can't get focused. That's a common symptom after a person's been betrayed. Then dissociation. It's almost you feel detached from reality. You're just zombie mode. You go through the motions of life, but you're not there. For some, there's even a sense of time slows down or even stops. They're just not connected to the present. Others then have trouble making decisions. They don't trust their ability to make decisions anymore because they've just been betrayed by somebody they thought they could trust, somebody they decided to trust. And it really starts to mess up their confidence in making decisions for themselves.",

and then you can just be constantly agitated you can't sit still you can't calm yourself your legs jiggling all the time then you can just be sweating a lot way more than normal that happens with people you can then start having panic attacks that come out of nowhere some go to either constipation or diarrhea it just throws off their whole gastrointestinal system some insomnia or they just want to sleep all the time some they get startled really easily the slightest little thing and they jump others find their blood pressure goes up or they have a racing heartbeat others all of a sudden you get you get a little bit of a panic attack and then you can just be sweating a lot way more than normal you get aches and pains you get muscle tension you get inflammation all of a sudden that happens or you get migraines headaches that you don't normally get or you're just tired all the time you can sleep all the time or you can't sleep at all but you're tired all the time those are some of the physical symptoms that can happen after you realize you've been betrayed that leads to behavioral symptoms that often happen with people that have been Freshly betrayed I just want to isolate from people I can't face anybody I don't want to have to explain I don't want to have to talk I'm going to isolate and then crying frequently just can't stop crying decreasing self-care don't take care of yourself don't shower don't eat properly don't sleep properly all of that can happen don't do the things that you used to do as healthy self-care or escapes healthy hobbies you just can't work as much and there's a decrease in your work productivity there's an increase or decrease in your eating we've talked about that for some there's an increase in aggressiveness in reactivity the person says the slightest little thing to you and you go into attack mode and you lash out that can happen others just spend all their time on social media that just numbs them out they just scroll through page after page of social media others go into just buying stuff and they make all kinds of unnecessary purchases it's a way of numbing it's a way of getting out of that pain for a while others go to alcohol and drugs it's a way of numbing it's a way of getting out of the pain some go to reckless behavior they drive radically they all of a sudden do stuff that potentially is quite risky they could die but part of them doesn't care if I die I die and they're increased there's an increase in risky behavior then there's relationships symptoms that come out of it and they're more long term for people they have been betrayed now they are looking at starting a relationship again just a friendship it's not necessarily romantic could be but it's not necessarily but all of a sudden they find that they're struggling to open up they're struggling with any kind of deeper intimacy that just scares them they can even be suspicious of kindness somebody's super kind to them and they go are they grooming me is there what do they want is there a hidden agenda here and they have huge trust issues they don't know if they can ever trust again they're suspicious of everything and then if they do get in a relationship they have difficulty maintaining that relationship every little thing the person does they overanalyze they look for negative they find the betrayal they pull away they test the other person and they're they have difficulty maintain relationships and then if the other person is wanting to get closer and get to know them better they're not comfortable with that they're kind of resisting that or pushing people away and then they can have Jealousy issues they start to get in a relationship and every time that belongs that person talks to somebody else they're I give them an insult anyway but the reason why more love is to get in that relationship and this has said a lot at least for some times the relationship and then another one of these relationships often are not focused that way they're just five two three or five هنا it's hard to run and tell guys and their correspondents can around them just it's hard to keep your Benson rods and get out of prison the person that does the other person and they know that tied off fighting real estate and this is cum star smell all white and it stirs up stuff and they get super jealous and that can cause trouble and then they can have all have a odd oppositional defiance they get in a relationship and the person says i think you should do this or here's what i think we should do and it's almost something is triggered inside of them that i want to do the opposite i am not going to follow anybody's advice i'm not going to trust anybody's advice i have to make all my decisions by myself then for some now when they get in a relationship to them if i'm not going to be betrayed by you and i'm going to be able to trust you then we there can be no boundaries you can never say no to me you can never say you need some personal space and they resist boundaries and boundaries to them proves you aren't loyal you don't love me you don't care.",

And as soon as everything's kind of smoothed over and calmed down, then they regress back to their old behaviors. they don't change their core issues. They make a few surface band-aid changes, to calm you down and get you off their back. that's another tactic that they would do. Now I need to point out that a lot of people, when they raise this with me, they think that the solution would be to go to their narcissist partner and say, I'm not happy. I'm doing all the work here. I am changing. You're not doing anything. You're not looking at your stuff. And they think if I just have a very old, open, clear discussion with them, where I communicate very clearly, that they'll hear me. And they'll go, oh, you're. I never thought of that. , I see you're doing all the work. I need to start changing. And they'll own it. All they need is you to say it clearly enough to convince them. But you want to know what usually happens with them. It doesn't work you thought it would. You have this wonderful discussion. And they take what you say and twist it to make you the bad guy. what you were hoping was this going to be this open, honest discussion that would lead them to see they need to own their part ends up being you pouring out your heart. They taking that, twisting it and using it against you. That typically happens. Now I got to add another piece here. Let's say you do get to a point where you decide they're unwilling to change. I have to end this. you communicate that to the narcissist and you say, it's done. Here's what's been happening. Here's what I've noticed. Here's the chances I given you. Here's what I've communicated to you. You still have done nothing. It's over. What they may try to do and you need to be prepared for this is contact you a week later or something.

Usually they want a discussion they can try to influence you. they're looking for an opening to be able to talk, to be able to plant seeds in your brain, to influence your thinking. that you take them back. You give them one more chance. They will make false promises. They will twist things a little bit, trying to get you to give them one more chance to take them back. But they're still not willing to change at a deep level. all of these different games, narcissists will play. Now, let me add another piece that has to be factored in here when it comes to ending a relationship. And this is a very important part. The relationship with a pure narcissist, as far as a partner or parents, is this is not a minor little decision. what color socks do I wear today. This is a major life altering decision. This is not a decision that can be made lightly. It has to be thought through closely, carefully, methodically. And. Never. Want. To. emphize. the importance of this decision. It's further complicated by the fact that often children are involved and you got a factor that in. Then there's financial considerations. If you separate, what are you going to do to pay your bills to get another place to stay. And then. Another factor can come in. and that is. What happens if they react very badly and they become violent. If they threaten to take the kids. If they go to court and totally mysteries represent me. me and take my kids. this could go really, really bad in a whole bunch of different directions if they don't respond. And there's a chance they won't respond. And then for some people, there's another factor. And that is they've got years of religious teaching and family beliefs about the sanctity of marriage, that you don't divorce, that is wrong. And they have a whole bunch of false guilt around doing that, or what they might do to the children by divorcing. there's a lot of pieces to this decision that you need help with a trained professional who really specializes in these things to help you think them through.",

What I find is their primary concern in asking me this question about ending a relationship, or what to do with a narcissist, is they're hoping I'm going to give them a new piece of information. What I really to do is temper them with a ShowBiz tip. That is early understanding, who'll talk to me early in the process, or what I do know, and perhaps find a way to interact with them, maybe talk to them later in the class. Or maybe show them some objects or do a little retrospective project to help them perform that wrinkles work for them. But when I come into the studio, I'm willing to do some tricks. , maybe have a three to end the relationship even though it is proven to be unhealthy even though the other person has proven they are unwilling to change the problem is no longer the narcissist the problem is you why are you unwilling to end it what issue is it that you have because that's really the problem now what issue is it that you have that is preventing you from ending it until you solve that figure that out and work on that and change that you're going to keep asking people for magical fixes but you're never going to get them.",

    "text": "And that's going to pay them back for not giving me healthy attention. the attention seeking is a hyper need because of lack of validation, healthy validation. The approval seeking, if you look at the shame that has developed, that I must not be good enough, I must not be good enough. And the child then doesn't have any positive feelings towards himself. But they want to be loved. They want to be approved. They want to feel good. they can't give that to themselves. they go looking to please others. To gain others approval as a solution to their shame. that is where this comes from. Now let me just show you some of the other things that parents can do that create this attention approval seeking life trap. many parents will place kind of in a shame type of culture. They place tons of importance on what other people think of them. they are always concerned with outward appearances or keeping up appearances. you got to act a certain way, dress a certain way, talk a certain way, have certain manners, do certain things in public in order to gain the approval of others. It's all about being approved by others. a child growing up in that, when they want to dress the way that suits them, that is comfortable to them, when they want to engage in certain hobbies or sports or activities, the parents are going, but is that going to be approved by the culture or the people I know in my culture. If not, no, you can't do that. You can't wear that. No, you can't have that activity. the child's life is not guided by their abilities, their drives, their desires. It's guided by keeping up appearances, getting the approval of the culture. And that then is a parent who can have this life trap themself. That their life is all based on gaining approval. their life is all about image. It's all about status. It's all about success. It's all about material possessions. It's all about money. It's all about externals. That is the guiding factor in their parent's life. And the child then is brought into that world and tried to get squeezed into that mold. Another thing that can happen is that children grow up where parents only validate them when they do what the parents do.",

Especially when you get criticized by these narcissists that blame you for being selfish, that blame you for being a narcissist. You start all this second guessing stuff. Then whenever you start changing, you're moving into an area of loneliness. You're moving into a life you've never lived in before. This is all brand new. This is unknown territory.

    "text": "Because a child can't meet any of their own needs. the only way they're going to survive, and get their needs met, is if they attach to somebody who can meet their needs. The bottom line with complex trauma is a child tries to connect with mom and dad or caregivers, but they're either too busy, too involved in their own issues, don't care, don't know how to meet the child's needs, don't know how to connect, don't know how to be present. And the child is not able to connect with those, those people. That then puts the child in a dilemma. Because they need to connect. They're driven to connect. if they can't connect with their caregivers, they will connect with something. here's kind of how it plays out in general terms. The first thing that the child will try to do is they still want to connect with mom and dad. And they'll use two methods to try and connect with mom and dad. If mom and dad won't connect with me when I'm authentic, they must find something wrong with me. Something that's my fault that causes them not to want to connect with me. that's a shame message. therefore, I will learn to fawn. I will learn to be what they want me to be. I will learn to read them, their needs, their priorities, their beliefs, and I will become what they want that then they will connect with me. I will become a people pleaser. the whole belief then is if I'm going to get my needs met, I need people to connect with. But the only way to do it is not by being authentic. It's by being fake. Authenticity prevents connection. that's number one. Number two is, if they still don't want to connect, they don't want to connect with me, even when I'm a super good people pleasing person, then I will find an area that causes them to give my attention, even if it's doing bad stuff.

That becomes their next connection point. But again, what I want you to see is their belief is, if I'm gonna fit into this group, I can't be authentic. I have to conform. I have to fawn. I have to be a chameleon, be what they want me to be. That is the only way I will connect and get my needs met. they have a form of attachment, but it's not a secure attachment. It's very conditional on them continuing to conform. But then it goes beyond that. They're still not totally satisfied. They still are driven to want to connect in other ways. And they will now try to connect with things that give them the feelings of connection, that they feel. let's look in a different perspective. We've got a little bit of a mix up here.",

Will I need to involve others. Do I have the time and the strength now to do all of this stuff. Those are important questions. the danger for many people who've been procrastinating is to think, I just got to start a task away, but they haven't thought it through. They get into the task, they realize, oh, this is too much. I don't have the time or the energy, and then they quit. Then they beat themselves up for quitting. And there's a healthy planning stage, in most important decisions, that isn't procrastination. That's actually taking the necessary time to plan carefully. let's look at dealing with the wounds from the past and the deep fears that those wounds have created as one aspect of healing procrastination. think back, first of all, to the past and the future. Think back to your earliest memory you have of when you procrastinated. If you're able to connect to that memory, ask yourself what you were feeling as a child at that time, why your brain felt it needed to procrastinate. And usually you're going to find there was some fear. find out what that fear was about. Was it a fear of punishment. Was it a fear of failure. Was it a fear of being rejected, laughed at. Look at what that fear was. What you can also do when you're there in that memory is just ask, are there any body sensations that I'm experiencing now that might accompany that memory. Often people will feel something in their gut or their throat or their chest area. They'll have trouble breathing. They'll feel kind of an increase of heat in their face. Check out body sensations. Then go to, what did that little child need at that time to help them face that fear. Did they just need encouragement. Did they need somebody to teach them. Did they need somebody to show them how to do it. Did they need to be able to do something and fail and not get criticized. What did that child need. Then comfort that child. Assure that child. But then go, probably that's the fear I'm facing today.",

Maybe I need support from somebody else. Figure out what do I need today. And there's no shame in that. There's no judgment in that. You are trying to give to yourself. Now, the things that weren't given to you as a child. Now, you may initially need a mentor or a therapist to help you go through this process of understanding why procrastination was developed by your brain as a child to protect you and to help you begin to know how to help that little child, which means helping yourself today. don't be afraid to ask for a therapist or a mentor to help you with this. Let me go to practical tools for today. you've brought healing to the little child, but now you've created, you got the bad habit to deal with. You've got to overcome the inertia of years of doing it this way. What are some practical things you can do to help yourself break this procrastination behavior. Here's some of the things that helped me. Break a big task down into little tasks. if I got to get a little bit of work done, I'm going to get this big task done. That just feels overwhelming. break it down into 50 little steps. I could do this today, that tomorrow, that tomorrow. And over the period of a week, I'm going to get the task done. break big tasks down into little tasks. Don't be afraid to reward yourself. If I accomplish this, then I am going to reward myself with something I really. That's what we do for a child. If you do this, I'll take you out for ice cream. Reward yourself with something you really. That's what we do for a child. If you do this, our limbic brain still needs those along the way. And then don't necessarily just wait to the end or the completion of the project to give yourself a reward. It's to give yourself rewards along the way. Oh, I got these steps done. Let's have a reward. we need that positive encouragement of rewards. And that doesn't mean I'm weak. That doesn't mean I'm a failure. That's just how we work.",

I need to get what I least want to do done off. Second, some people, if they're going to say, I'm going to start this job. They need a 10 minute, we call it 10 minute technique to warm up to the job where they do little activities. They do some yoga. They listen to some music. They get themselves into a good headspace. And allow yourself, if you need it, a 10 minute, 15 minute window to kind of get yourself into the mood. Some people, they need to change their environment. I need to write this letter. I need to get this project done. I can't do it sitting in my office or sitting in my living room. I need to find a different place and change it up. And that often helps them get started. Another thing that people can do is to say, I am not going to start this task and stick at it for three hours until it's done. That's just too much for me. I'm going to break it into 30 minute windows, 30 minute blocks, and then it will be done. But I'm not going to overwhelm myself with the whole project. Some people find it helpful to just put it on the calendar. I am going to start this job at this time. Then they make themselves accountable to a friend. But having it that start time on the calendar is important for them. Another thing is I have asked myself, when am I most motivated to do hard work.

Another thing that can be helpful is do it with a friend. If you're just finding it impossible to get motivated to do it on your own, ask a friend. Would you come over and just help me as I do this project. Just be with me as I do this project. That can often provide some great motivation. Another thing, be accountable. Tell your friend, I'm going to be doing this job today. Check in with me tomorrow just to make sure I've done it. And that just provides a little bit of extra motivation. Play the tape to the end. Just get out of that limbic brain, which is procrastination, is I want to avoid, avoid, avoid. This is too much, too much. I'm feeling stressed, overwhelmed. Get back to your cortex and go, if I don't do this, here's the consequences. If I force myself somehow, find a way to do it, I am going to be thankful. It's going to be such a relief of stress.

I'm married, number one, and how do I know if I should get a divorce or not. Number two, I'm dating, are there any guidelines that would help me know if I should end the relationship. Because I'm not convinced the guy's a jerk, but he's starting to look one, help me with that. And number three, I'm in a relationship that's been going for a long time as we've gone through addiction together, cheating together, all of that kind of stuff, even some abuse. Can it be repaired. Or do I just say, no, see you later. Or in a relationship. In a friendship type of relationship, I'm getting to know this person, and I've let them into my life, and now I'm kind of second-guessing myself that maybe I shouldn't have let them in far. Now what do I do. Do I ghost them and walk away. Do I try to push boundaries out a little bit and make it more of a casual friendship. How do you do that, and what's the best way to go. I get asked that a lot. Bottom line is the issue is this. In a relationship, should I fight for it or end it. And that happens in all kinds of scenarios, from intimate romantic relationships to friendships, etc. that's what I want to look at. Now to kind of set the stage in your mind, I just want you to think about how you've responded to relationship problems. I want you to think about how you've responded to relationship problems in the past. some of you are excellent at one strike, you're out. You hurt me, I ghost you, no second chances, not going to work at it, not going to try to repair it, it's done. And that's how you've gone through adult life. Others of you give way too many chances. You let them hurt you, abuse you, cheat on you, and you keep taking them back. that's kind of one of two extremes. A third scenario, and I get this one all the time.",

I'm going to do it. they announce a boundary and then never enforce it. That's very common as. Or they set a boundary, enforce it for a little while, and then things start improving and they let the boundary disappear. And it goes back to the way it used to be. And that's a very normal thing.

And I want you to think about a different way tonight. let me give you the criteria that I would present to a person. big picture, and we've talked about this. A relationship can only get healthy and only grow if both people are working on it. Both people have to be willing to own their stuff and change. If only one person is working and the other refuses to, that relationship will not work or be healthy no matter how hard you try to work. that's just reality. , future of any relationship, when people come to see me, I'm not just looking at, are you willing to own your stuff and change.

And people hear that and think, maybe I am because I am an addict, blah, blah, blah. And they stay in the relationship way too long. that is a very common thing. number one thing you got to do. You need to know where to draw a line in the sand that says, if you cross this line, we're done. And that line can't just be that you don't dye your hair a certain color. That's a dumb line. It's got to be a line that's related to character. if you keep lying to me, we're done. If you don't start growing up and accepting responsibility for things around here, we're done.

And we all know from experience that people can change in order to get you to change the consequence but it's not genuine change. It is change in a crisis to manipulate you to let them away with it. we have to develop criteria that takes that into consideration. Because many people have been fooled by that over and over again. Here's what I tell people. The only way I would be convinced that somebody who's been abusive to me or has cheated on me has really changed is they cannot be in my life. They got to want to change for themselves with no hope of ever having a relationship with me. Because if they're changing in order to get a relationship for themselves with me, I can't trust that change. Because they're possibly just changing for all the wrong reasons and it's not genuine. the only way to be convinced is they got to be separate from me and they got to be committed to change on their own for themselves.

I have got to take them out of their promised land and put them in a safe bubble for 400 years they can grow as a nation. Now how am I going to get people to go from their nice little new land that they love and are not going to leave. How am I going to get them to leave it. I am going to send a famine. If there is a famine where would they go for food. Egypt has the Nile River and it is the bread basket of the world they will go to Egypt to get food. That is great far but there is a problem. Egyptians hate people from Israel. the only way they are going to let them come to Egypt to eat is if somebody who loves Jews is in Egypt in the government. how am I going to get somebody who loves Israel into the government and for them to get into the government they have got to rub shoulders with influential people. They have got to get to know how the government runs. They have got to get training on being a good administrator. How am I going to do that. I have some brothers who hate their brother. I am not interfering. I am just letting people do their thing. They are going to sell them. He is going to be a slave. He is going to get training with Potiphar. Rub shoulders with the high and mighty. He is going to go to prison. He is going to get training there and rub shoulders with the three closest people to Pharaoh. Pharaoh is going to have a dream. isn't that interesting. what happened was this. The famine hit. Guess who shows up one day. Juan and Graeme. His ten older brothers. Now if that was me I would say you are all dead. Because you screwed me over. But here is what he says. It says his brothers came and bowed before him just his dreams said they would do. And they thought they would never do. But they came and threw themselves into the fire. They threw themselves on the ground before him. And here is what he says.",

And you question your perception. up front, what I hope you're beginning to see is what is happening here doesn't wear you down in one day or one week or one month, but they slowly plant seeds that gradually get you to doubt yourself. And that is the effect of gaslighting. It's such a slow process that you often don't even realize it's happening. The fourth thing they can do is forgetting. you talk about something and they say, no, I was there. That didn't happen. Where it did happen, but they make it sound it didn't happen, they're questioning your memory and again, you are questioning your own memory. they can go a bit further and go, what. You always are remembering things incorrectly. What's wrong with you. You make stuff up. You're imagining things. Now, they're the one that is lying to you about all of that, but you're believing it as if they're true. Or you start talking about something and they act they forgot all about what you said before. And they deny that they were in the conversation with you and they again say, what. I think you're making stuff up. I don't think you're remembering this correctly because I sure don't remember it. Again, planting seeds of doubt. it's a very gradual process. the 16 signs that you can then ask yourself that are indicators that you are being gaslit,. you can check these off. Number one is that you are in a conversation with your partner and every time there's conflict or a disagreement, you feel pulled by them to blame yourself for the problems that you're having in the relationship. In other words, they always make it your fault. They never accept responsibility, but twist everything and make it your fault. whatever you say, they distort it and they make it your fault. you begin to think maybe they're because I always seem to be messing up. And they can give very convincing arguments why you're wrong and they're and it's all your fault. you get that constantly pulled into accepting blame for everything. Secondly, you begin to second guess yourself. you're in situations.",

    "text": "You're in situations where you're in a situation where you're in a situation where you're in a situation and you all of a sudden go, maybe I'm not seeing this accurately. Now let me just stop here and say this. Part of complex trauma is that you're going to have times where you legitimately question your perception because it's distorted because you're angry or you're in fear. that's healthy questioning your perception. What's happening in gaslighting is even when you're not in an emotionally escalated state, you start to question. You start to question your perception. The times that you normally in the past would have been accurate in your perception, you now question and doubt yourself. you are having less confidence in yourself. Thirdly, you begin to conclude that maybe they're and I am too sensitive. Maybe they are and I make too big a deal out of things. I just need to get over stuff. I let too much stuff. I let too much stuff bother me. Again, complex trauma, often we do overreact. Gaslighting, they make you question everything as an overreaction. And it takes it one step further than just the natural consequences that come out of complex trauma. Three, or four, you constantly apologize. you are with a friend and you're not going to apologize. You're going to apologize. You're going to apologize. And you say something and then you go, oh, I'm sorry. I hope I didn't say the wrong thing. Or sorry, I might have hurt your feelings. And after a while they go, would you quit apologizing. Because you have been trained that you're always wrong. That there's nothing you do that is ever all. There's always something wrong. you say something wrong. You do something wrong. you are trained to apologize all the time. Next one is you feel with that you can't do anything wrong. You can't do anything. this is when those subtle seeds and messages that have been happening for months from your partner are starting to take their toll. And now you are beginning to believe that maybe you can't do anything. And maybe you can't do anything. you're starting now to look down on yourself even more than normal. You're starting to be harder on yourself than even normal. Next one is you feel very confused at times about what is the decision.",

You've been unaware of what has been happening emotionally. But now there's much negative emotions, it's starting to come into your conscious world. You begin to become aware also with that, that your self-esteem is getting lower. And you think, I used to be confident around my friends and family. Now I'm constantly full of anxiety and insecurity around people, afraid I'm going to say the wrong thing, I'm going to do the wrong thing. And now you're realizing your self-confidence is getting worse, is getting lower, and you're not as relaxed as you used to be. You're not as happy. And you realize that you're going to a darker and darker place. And it's not a good place. You see that you're not the person you used to be, but you're becoming a shell of that person, and that person is not a very happy person, is not a very healthy person. And again, you're becoming aware of it. That takes you further in isolating. Because the less confidence you have, the less relaxed you are, the less you want to be around people, because you think everybody else is thinking the same thing as your partner about you. You think they're judging you and looking down on you, and seeing you as a failure, and that causes you to isolate, which causes your self-esteem to get even worse. And then, you don't think anybody else would want a relationship with you, and you don't think anybody would ever give you unconditional love, because you're such a loser, and that takes you even further into isolation. what you can see is there's a snowballing effect beginning to happen as you go further and further down this road of being gaslit. now, you realize something's wrong. But because you've been influenced by your partner in your thinking, and you've let your partner think for you, you can't figure out what's wrong. You can't say it's him, because he's never said that. In your mind, it's all you, but you don't know what it is you've done.",

Then, conflict just keeps increasing. And he is more, or she is more, on you all the time, more negative, more disrespectful, tearing you down, but nothing is ever resolved in the conflicts. Rather, you are always the problem, and they always play the victim. I can't stand living with you. You don't do anything. Poor me. Who would ever want to live with a person with me. Give me a crown for being such a wonderful person and putting up with you. And that just is what gets fed. His victim mentality, your, it's all my fault. And that takes it even worse. the conflict is snowballing, and increasing. Some people, as this progresses, their memory actually does become hazy. And what I would say is the explanation for that is what you can realize is gaslighting began in your subconscious world. Once the stress on your subconscious world got great, it moved to your conscious world. But you weren't able to figure it out or resolve it. what then happened. what then happens is the stress keeps building and building in your conscious world with no solution. That begins to affect your memory. when stress is too great for the brain, it can't keep track of everything. your short-term memory begins to fail. And now you do forget details, which gives proof to the gaslighter that you're going crazy. now you're actually feeding into what he's been doing all along to say you're losing your mind, you're the problem. again, this is getting to a very dangerous place. And the final piece is you start to gaslight yourself. You don't need anybody else to gaslight you now. You start to question every perception, doubt every thought, doubt every feeling, and put it all in a negative framework. Now you're your own worst enemy. those are the 16 characteristics of a person who's been gaslit. Some of you have gone through that. Some of you are in the process.

But it's a dance where you give them the control to take the lead in the dance. they take the next step and you follow in this gaslight tango. And what you're doing in giving them the lead is you're letting them define your reality for you. they're defining it. If you haven't heard it yet in what I said, let me recap it. They define your reality in three areas. Number one, they define yourself, who you are. And what is happening is a healthy, positive self image is gradually eroded that it becomes less and less, more and more negative until you feel a zero. And that is their goal, to get all positive self esteem knocked out of you. Because it's only then that they can have total power over you. that's number one. They need to define your identity for you and not let you define your own identity. Secondly, they need to define your perception of reality. And they want to get you to the place where you think that you can't even determine what's real anymore. Because you get it all mixed up. They told you, you misread this, you misread that. You're making that up. in your mind, you're not sure what is fantasy or reality or a lie. And you let them tell you what it is. And they do that for you. And then they get you never question them. in the early days of gaslighting, the response when they say you're making that up is what's wrong with you. I was there, I know what happened. And they go, no you don't. You're making that up. At first you go, they're having a bad day. And you can identify something's off with them. But over time, they can be negative and distorted all the time. And you can no longer tell that they're distorted. You can no longer tell something is off. they get you to the place where you never question whether the problem is them. Where you never question whether they're the ones that are twisting reality and you're the one that is seeing it accurately. they've worn down the three things you need to move forward in life.",

Yes, you're , you're. Just to avoid conflict. And away you go. And then you got that good old limbic brain. Complex trauma, you define reality, not by facts, but how you're feeling. your cortex that learns to piece together the facts of life and make decisions based on facts and evidence, not on feelings, has never been developed. That part of your brain has not been developed. , guess what people who gaslight are great at doing. Triggering your limbic brain that you define reality by what you're feeling at that moment. And they're good at making you feel certain things. And then you believe what they're saying, the distortions. complex trauma in many different ways sets people up to fall prey to gaslighters. let me end with this. What happens if you're in a relationship this. I do hope that you can see that the longer you stay in it, the more damage it's going to do to you.

Paul said, I'm going to go back to the cities that I've already visited, that there's new little groups of followers of , and I'm going to check up on them, spend time with them, teach them. And then I'll just keep going a little bit further west. he went through the places he had already been and he started to go west, but we're told that, and we don't know how, but something stopped him or prevented him from going further west.

And it's a man, who would be in modern day Greece, which is on the other side of the Aegean Sea. And he says, Paul, please come here. And Paul says, I think 's trying to tell me where to go next. he gets on a ship, goes across the sea to Greece, and then he starts there. And what then happens while he's there is also very instructive for us, because Paul's normal plan and his practice when he went to a Gentile city was that there usually would be a small group of Jewish people who had left Israel and gone for business or whatever. He would find a little synagogue where they met and go and meet with them and tell them about the Jewish. Sometimes they got mad and kicked them out, but he always would start there. Paul gets to Philippi, the city that he first goes to in modern Greece. And there's no synagogues anywhere. he goes, Now what do I do. My normal practice is all messed up. There's nobody to meet with. what he realized is that often religious or spiritually based people would have places to get together that were quiet, where they could and connect with their higher power. And they would do it outside of the city, often in nature by a river or something that. Paul checked around and found out that there was a group of people that went outside of the city to a quiet place to. he says, I'm going to go there. Now what he found is they were all women. he's going, This is going to be one hard city to crack. There's not even one man that's spiritually inclined. There's no Jews there that would meet. There's a small group of women that meet in this quiet place. Now why that's significant is this. In that world, it was a man's world. Men had the jobs. Women did not. And what influence could a small group of women have to reach a city. to the average person, they have zero impact on a city. You have to reach men if you want to make a difference.

Do they still cherish me. Or how important am I to you. Am I more important to you than your parents are. Am I more important to you than your friends are. Or your job. Or your personal hobbies. Where do I fit in your top priorities. Constantly being evaluated. Do I come first in your life. And that might be for some, do I come first next to your higher power. Do you just take me for granted. Have you stopped really appreciating me and you're just assuming I'm going to be there for you. Are you looking around, checking to see if there might be somebody better than I am in your life. Will you keep caring for me even when you're struggling or when you're hurting or when you're sick. Or will you keep caring for me even when I'm struggling. When I'm hurting. How about when I start losing my beauty. Will you still value me then. Will you care for me when you are frustrated with me. Will you still value me. Are you committed to care for me just out of a sense of duty that this is your obligation, but really you see me as a bit of a burden. Or do you still care for me because you delight in me. All of those are the ongoing questions when there's a committed relationship. How committed is it is really what it's boiling down to. And what that therefore means is, how much do you value me. let me then take that further. What then do you do when trust has been broken. let me make that really practical. And let's look at this in the same way. What if you had a sense of reparenting yourself today. there's a part of you that you abandoned. There's a part of you that where trust was broken. You were not committed to yourself, to care for yourself, to care for the wounded part of yourself. How do you rebuild that trust today.",

But then make a commitment to them. Make a commitment to yourself today to meet your 12 needs that you won't abandon that child again. And that will be their deepest fear. make that commitment and make sure you're making it in your cortex, not just out of your limbic brain. But that then means figuring out how to maintain internal boundaries. if you're going to meet your 12 needs consistently, you have to make a commitment to get a certain amount of sleep, to eat a certain way, to get exercise, to take care of yourself emotionally, to be mindful of how you're doing. you set boundaries. I'm going to get up at this time. I'm going to have a time to meditate, to do an inventory of how I'm doing. I'm going to do different physical type of exercises. I'm making a commitment.

You wanted to shove that part of you into a closet or cut it off somehow. That's the part of you that now you need to accept.

I'll go through these quickly. Create a ritual time together. A date night. You can date yourself. You can go for a date night with each of your children, with your partner. It's a planned time just to enjoy them. Just to do things together. Very important to do. Tell them regularly the positive qualities that they have. Identify them. Don't just say generically, you're a wonderful person. Specify those positive qualities. Have fun with them. Don't just make the time with them always serious. You need serious times of sharing, but you need to enjoy times together. Comfort them when they're hurting. Check in with them several times a day just to let them know you're thinking of them, just to ask them how they're doing. Write them little notes. Leave them in their lunches. Leave them on their pillow. Things that say, I love you, I appreciate you. And if they are wanting or needing your attention, stop what you're doing and give them your full attention. Buy them something that is meaningful to them, that communicates that they're special to you. Ask them specific questions about their life. Do a project. Do a project together that they would enjoy doing. Do service activities together. you're working together as a team in helping others. Set boundaries with other people who are wanting more and more of your time, who are needy or who are pushy. But set boundaries to say, no, I'm not going to let you have more of my time because that would violate the time I need to carry out my commitment to this relationship. Do something with them that they enjoy but might not be enjoyable to you. if it's with one of your children, they might want to have a tea party and that would bore you to death. But do it because it means much to them. Support them in their interests. if they want to take up a musical instrument, support them in that.",

I'm going to help you. I'm going to help you. You're quirky, come to accept that. Don't try to shut them up because it embarrasses you. Have their back when somebody attacks them. Stand up for them. If they're having a really bad day and they just can't do some of the things they need to do, step in and help. Always treat them with respect, even when they're having a bad day and not acting the best. Don't shame them. Don't disrespect them. Work hard to resolve any problems that have come up in the relationship. Communicate a lot. And for some of us, that means more than just how's your day and here's what I did today. It means filling up space and time sometimes with just more superficial communication, just that communication is happening. Be in their corner. If they have times when they doubt themselves, be there to encourage them to validate their positive qualities. there's a whole lot that is part of building trust. There has to be commitment. But to be commitment, you have to validate. You have to cherish. You have to value them and nurture that on an ongoing basis.

They don't satisfy, they don't fix the shame problem, because you're trying to solve it through respect from others, but you don't respect yourself. And that is where it breaks down. , let me give you something about this. Where does my value come from. it's. There's one thing to say, I have shame and I feel I have no value. The question is, is that true. Do I have any value inherently, or does my value come only from my externals. there's four things, four types of value, four types of respect,. Number one is inherent value. Born into every human being is a sense of value. do you realize that babies are a total drain on our economy and our energy, and they take, take, take, take. And we love them to death and value them. Why. They can't do a job. They can't make money. They don't help pay the bills. They just create more bills. They don't give you greater peace of mind. They give you more anxiety. They don't give you greater sleep. They give you less sleep. But why do we value a baby. Because something is born in us that comes with the package of an infant that we say that child has value. Even though they can do nothing, they still have value. we all have that. And what that means is, that's why we treat every person with respect. They might be a total jerk, but they're still a human. And they have. They do not and require a certain amount of respect. There's an equality in all of us called humanity. And that deserves respect. If you think too of a person with severe Alzheimer's, they are a drain on our economy. They're a drain on your energy and time and resources. But we don't go and put them to death because we say they still have value.

Third type are people who make many sacrifices to help others. And you watch what they give. You watch the time and energy they put into people and serve people. And you say, you have earned my respect. you can have a baby and give them respect, but then you can have somebody with great character and great servant heart. And you go, wow, I look up to you. You've earned that. Then there's a fourth type. And that's the badge. That's the position of authority. you could have a policeman who doesn't have any character. He's corrupt. He doesn't do anything good. He's puts all the wrong people arrested, but you still respect them because he's wearing a badge. And you go, if I don't respect the badge, I don't respect the person wearing the badge, but I got to respect the badge. Now let me take that and apply it to the person who's wearing the badge. One of the most common things used in recovery by parents. You got to do what I want because you're supposed to respect your parents. What does that mean. Is that respect one, two, three, or four. Do you realize that all you owe your parents is number one and four. If they haven't earned your respect out of character or the kind of behaviors, they don't deserve that. Kind of respect. You're not required to give it to them, but you still want to give them the respect you would give any stranger that's inherent in all of us. And you want to give them the respect of the badge of their position as parents. But it sure doesn't mean that you don't have to have boundaries with them. It sure doesn't mean you don't have to call them on their stuff. It sure doesn't mean you have to say, you're out of my life for now. You can still say that and have number one and four respect.

You're being unloving and unkind. shame takes boundary setting and distorts it to be a bad thing. And why you should never do it. But if you don't, you'll never get healthy. You will always be used and abused. And people will just take advantage of you and wear you out and beat you into the ground. Some people, if they're not afraid to say no, they'll let people use them and use them and use them. And then one of two things will happen to try to get them out of the way. Number one is they'll isolate. the only way they can set a boundary is move away from everybody. That doesn't really work very in the long run. The second thing is they explode. And that drives everybody away. It's kind of a boundary setting thing.

There's who we go to see. she had the first advantage for advertising her wares because she was in the wall, and she could put a scarlet cord or rope hanging out of her window. she was a prominent, powerful, renowned prostitute who was busier and more respected than other prostitutes. that's a little bit about Rahab. what is going to happen is when they come to the Promised Land, before they cross the river to go across, they send two spies to check out Jericho to get a report of what to expect. Those two spies go to Rahab's house. Now, I'll explain that in just a minute, but let me read you the story. Joshua secretly sent out two spies. He instructed them, scout out the land on the other side of the Jordan, especially around Jericho. the two men set out and came to the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there that night. Someone told the king of Jericho, some Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land. the king sent orders to Rahab, bring out the men who have come into your house, for they have come here to spy out the whole land. Rahab had hidden the two men, but she replied, yes, the men were here earlier, but I don't know where they're from. They left town as the gates were about to close. I don't know where they went. A bold-faced lie. Actually, she had hidden them on the roof, beneath bundles of flax. Before the spies went to sleep that night, Rahab went up on the roof, not to give them sex, but to talk with them. And here's what she says. I know the has given you this land. In other words, I know you're going to win. We're all afraid of you. Everyone in the land is living in terror. We have heard how your made a dry path for you through the Red Sea when you left Egypt. We know that you do not know what you did to the Amorite kings east of Jordan, whose people you completely destroyed. In other words, you defeated armies much greater than you. No wonder our hearts have melted in fear.",

Where would a guy go if they're visiting this city of Jericho and you're a traveling salesperson, a traveling businessman. Where do they tend to go. To prostitutes. And what do they do when they're with prostitutes. They talked. The only time guys talk. And they start talking. And they're starting to share all kinds of different stories. if you want to find out what's going on in a country and a city, who is the best person to talk to. A prostitute. One who would get more traffic than anybody else. that is Joshua's logic. Where do I go to find out what the people are thinking and feeling. Let's find a prominent prostitute. Oh look, hanging out of that window in the land. And on the wall is a scarlet rope. Let's go there boys and find out from her what's going on. that was the thing. Now what is very interesting, and this is the part I want you to really kind of think deeper with me about. After they conquered, after this visit, Rahab said, you're going to defeat us. Please let your save me. And the spy said to her, our will save you if you hang out your rope when we start walking around the city. And when the city falls, your place will not crumble and fall if that rope is hanging out of the window. She believed them. She kept the rope out. They went around the city the seven times. If you remember the seven days, the seven times on the last day, they blew a trumpet and the wall started falling down. All except the wall where Rahab's house was. She was spared because she believed in Israel's. The result of that is she went and lived with the Israelites. She became a member of their community. She married that somebody within that community. , I want you to begin to think with me about all of that.",

And it's a very dangerous thing to be part of if you are on the recipient end of somebody that is gaslighting you. I want to start with four types of things that a gaslighter will do to begin to wear you down. It's to get you to begin to think maybe you're going crazy and that you can't trust your own self anymore, your own perception of reality. number one is they can begin to play games with you to make you question your memory. you might go home every night and put your keys in the same spot, and then one night they will remove the keys when you're not looking and hide them somewhere else. And you'll go looking for your keys, and you can't find it, and they won't admit, that they've moved them. They will let you begin to wonder if you're losing your memory. that is a very initial type of thing that they do to plant the idea that your memory maybe isn't as reliable. that can go in various directions. The second thing is what we would call withholding. And that simply is you try to discuss something with them, and you don't succeed in discussing it. you try to discuss something with them, and they act they don't understand you, you're not making sense. And they're basically saying, you're talking crazy. I don't get what you're trying to say. And the idea is to plant the idea in your mind that maybe you don't make sense. Maybe you are going crazy. again, it's a planting of a thought. Or you start to talk about, or you start to talk about something, and you make perfect sense, but they're not going to admit that. They're going to say you're talking crazy, and then they're going to say, I refuse to talk about this. Until you can talk sense, we're done. And they shut it down. And you walk away with no way to clarify, no way to have them try to understand you. You're just shut down, left with the feeling or the impression from them that you're talking crazy.",

And they shut it permanently down. those are all ways of stopping fruitful conversation, because they do not allow you to talk about it. you're trying to talk about it, and they don't allow you to do it, but they make you feel that you're crazy, or you're not clear. The third thing that they do is trivialize yourself. they trivialize your needs, they trivialize your feelings, they trivialize how you respond to your emotions, and how you read things. they might say something , you always overreact, you're just too sensitive. And they say, you shouldn't feel that way. A normal person wouldn't feel that way. And you begin to doubt yourself, or you get angry over the dumbest little things. again, you start to question yourself. Maybe I am too sensitive. Maybe I do overreact. Maybe I make too big of a deal out of things. And you question your perception. up front, what I hope you're beginning to see is what is happening here doesn't wear you down in one day or one week or one month. But they slowly plant seeds that gradually get you to doubt yourself. And that is the effect of gaslighting. It's such a slow process that you often don't even realize it's happening. The fourth thing they can do is forgetting. you talk about something and they say, no, I was there, that didn't happen. Where it did happen, but they make it sound it didn't happen. they're questioning your memory. And again, you are questioning your own memory. they can go a bit further and go, what, you always are remembering things incorrectly. What's wrong with you. You make stuff up, you're imagining things. Now they're the one that is lying to you about all of that, but you're believing it as if they're true. Or you start talking about things, you start thinking about something, and they act they forgot all about what you said before.",

There's always something wrong. you say something wrong, you do something wrong, you are trained to apologize all the time. Next one, is you feel with that you can't do anything. this is when those subtle seeds and messages that have been happening for months from your partner are starting to take their toll. And now you are beginning to believe that maybe you can't do anything. And maybe you can't do anything. you are starting now to look down on yourself even more than normal. You are starting to be harder on yourself than even normal. Next one, is you feel very confused at times about what is the decision. should I get 1 milk or 2 milk. And you stand there second guessing yourself. And you are confused and you are afraid of making the wrong decision because you are going to get in trouble. the most basic decisions become more difficult to make because you are doubting your ability to make any decisions. Then you start lying to your partner to avoid his put downs. if he said, what did you go to the store for. And you say, I went to get milk. All of a sudden you are afraid that he is going to criticize that. you lie about where you went. that is now taking lying to a new level in the relationship because you are constantly in fear of being judged by them. And that is a very dangerous place. you are constantly trying to avoid all of these criticisms that he is going to give you. Then though, when you are with your friends, they probably saw a long time ago that he was a narcissist and that he was not treating you. And they might even have seen some of the gas lighting. But you don't want to admit to them that they are. you lie to your friends about your partner because you are afraid to admit what you are in.",

And then you don't think anybody would want a relationship with you. And you don't think anybody would ever give you unconditional love, because you're such a loser. And that takes you even further into isolation. what you can see is there's a snowballing effect beginning to happen as you go further and further down this road of being gaslit. now you realize something's wrong. But because you've been influenced by your partner in your thinking, and you've let your partner think for you, you can't figure out what's wrong. You can't say it's him, because he's never said that. In your mind, it's all you, but you don't know what it is you've done. And you enter this very confused stage of trying to diagnose why you're in such a dark place with no self-confidence, no self-worth, and you're just full of anxiety, and you can't figure it out. Then conflict just keeps increasing. And he is more, or she is more on you all the time, more negative, more disrespectful, tearing you down, but nothing is ever resolved in the conflicts. Rather, you are always the problem, and they always play the victim. I can't stand living with you. You don't do anything. Poor me. Who would ever want to live with a person with me. Give me a crown for being such a wonderful person and putting up with you. And that just, is what gets fed. His victim mentality, your, it's all my fault. And that takes it even worse. the conflict is snowballing and increasing. Some people, as this progresses, their memory actually does become hazy.

Once the stress on your subconscious world got great, it moved to your conscious world. But you weren't able to figure it out or resolve it.",

Now, what I want you to see as we go through these is why the parents these roles. why do they the hero child. Because now they can go to all their friends and they can say, hey, this child proves we're good parents. This child proves we're healthy. This child proves we have a great family. Because this child is our trophy. And we're going to show them off to everybody because it makes us look good. And that is why they love it. And the child loves it because now they're being validated. They're being shown off. And they just soak it up. But problems happen when this child reaches adulthood. Now, I've worked with enough people over the years to know that there's a very good chance that many of you here tonight were the hero child and you still easily slide into that role. But here's what begins to happen. In that adult person, the hero child has all the results of complex trauma, which is shame. deep down, they feel inadequate. Deep down, they don't feel good. They don't feel they're good enough. But they've never looked at it. They've never dealt with it. Because their priority has been performing perfection. And now in adult life, they still don't look at it. But because they're very capable, they put all their energy into performance, to doing work, signing up for the latest committee, etc. And all of that, they do stuff, they do stuff, and their focus becomes image. I can't fix my internal, is their thinking. I can't fix that shame. let's build a perfect house of cards where I do everything perfectly on the outside. And some go even beyond just performing lots of activity to having the perfect body, to having a house that's always neat, to having kids that are always dressed up and in sports, and high achievers. Everything becomes about looking good. And as they do that, and most are able to do it for a while, people applaud them. People say, Wow, I wish I could be you. You have your act together. And it just feeds their shame, they think is a solution to it, and they feed off of it.",

And as that has happened, they start to feel themselves burning out. Then they start to resent people who expect them to do much. And they're getting angry on the inside, and tired, and burnt out, and they feel themselves heading towards a collapse, or a breakdown. And that's where many who are in recovery say, I need a relapse to have a holiday. The problem is, once they have their relapse holiday, they come back into recovery, and they're still afraid to look at themselves. And they say, let's rev the motor back up again, and let's start going to all kinds of meetings, and doing all kinds of service work, and doing all of this stuff. And they rebuild their house of cards. Everybody loves them again, and everybody wants to be them, but everybody asks them to do more and more, and they burn out again. And , they begin to have problems. And then in a relationship, they start to feel they're not doing enough. And then in a relationship, their children are mad because they're never home, their partner's mad because they're never home, and when they are home, they're exhausted. And everybody suffers in the family, but everybody outside the family gets the best them. And the kids and the partner now have resentments towards them.

And then another problem they have is in order to be this perfect person on the outside, they take on projects called needy people. And they're picking up all these needy people, and for a while it feeds their ego, but after a while it burns them out even worse. Now they come into recovery. Let's say they come to react or finding freedom. And I say, let's forget about doing. You got to look at your shame. They don't know what to do with that. And it gets them confused because their whole life has been about the outside, the externals. And they are the type of people that say, I don't need to look at that stuff. Just tell me what to do and I'll do it. And I'll say, I'll tell you what to do. Look at that stuff. And they don't want to go there because there's a huge fear that if they start looking at how broken they are, that they will just melt in a puddle of tears and depression and it'll be too much.

And pretty soon you'll be happy you went there because you'll be getting healthy on the inside. But it is super, super scary.

And everybody's going to talk about how drunk they got. And then they push and push always a new way of rebelling against the system. And that can be a problem. And then as soon as somebody says, who's in authority, I want you to do this, they've trained themselves to do the opposite. And in a relationship, if their partner said, could you do this for me. They just get their back up. And they don't want to do that for them. And to have a relationship, they're going to have to look at that rebellious knee-jerk reaction that is part of how they train themselves to respond to authority and to rules. And then much of what they learn to do in their rebellion is to manipulate people, to intimidate people. they got what they want, but people don't see them as safe. People see them as a bit of a danger, a loose cannon. As a person who couldn't be trusted. A person that's just got too many anger issues. And they struggle with all of that. And the problem child, it started out really good. They refused to accept a sick situation. But what happened is they, in order to maintain that role, had to get sicker and sicker themselves. They don't realize how sick they had to become. And now when they come into adult life, they're going to still find people who pat them on the back for being a bad boy and pushing the envelope. But if they're going to get healthy and have healthy relationships, they've got to be able to let that bad boy go. Now here's a challenge that many have. They go, if I let go of the bad boy, then who am I. I don't want to become a weak, little, mushy, sensitive person again that's going to get walked all over and hurt.

Let me say one final thing about the problem child, the bad boy. I find that, let's say you were a bad girl,. Isn't it interesting how bad girls are attracted to bad boys.

That's a recipe for disaster. if that is your pattern, you're going to have to look at that piece as. , that's two today. last week we talked about ' first and called the Beatitudes. we looked at are the poor in spirit. And what we saw is that he was giving us a recipe for a healthy life, a satisfying life, how to find peace and contentment. And it basically sounded a contradiction, a total paradox. to be happy, you have to be poor in spirit. You got to mourn. You got to be meek. And what we saw is that it presented a parallel to the 12 steps, and they were based on the Beatitudes. And is saying, you can't do it on your own. There's something broken inside. And you have to go there and with 's help and then surrender. And we use that meekness, the little jockey on a horse. I got thinking about all of that. And I got thinking, there's actually a part of the that gives us a word picture of what taught. And it is Psalm 23. And if you're familiar with the , Psalm 23 is, The is my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside quiet waters. He restores my soul. And then the verse that's used at many funerals, even though I'm walking in the streets, walking through the valley of the shadow of death, I will not be afraid for you're with me, your rod and your staff, they comfort me.",

And if the shepherd doesn't get them within a half an hour and stand them back on their feet, they will die of panic. That is how bad it is. Now David wrote another Psalm, Psalm 42 and Psalm 43, and he starts both Psalms by saying this, Why are you cast down, O my soul. What is he saying. He's saying as I do my journal today, I am in a panic stage. I am a sheep on his back that feels hopeless. And I am about to die. And I am ready to give up hope. Why. What is going on. And then he says this, Hope in , and you will yet praise him. David was saying, I at times am a sheep when I get super depressed and I begin to feel hopeless and I start to despair. That's when I need my shepherd. Now there's a second way that a shepherd restores the soul. the first is, when I'm that hopeless cast down state, he restores my soul by giving me hope, by standing me on my feet again. There's a second time when a sheep will lose hope. That's in the hot dry summer. In a time of drought. you can imagine they're out on a mountain, and they're going from pasture field to pasture field, no grass, no grass. And they're carrying all this wool, they're hot, they're thirsty, they're getting discouraged, and they're getting to feel hopeless. Their soul is cast down. Where does a shepherd take that worn out, exhausted, thirsty, cast down sheep. To a valley. You realize water always goes to the lowest point. even where there's a hot summer or a drought, where can you find water for your sheep. In a valley. But what does he go on in the next verse to say. That the valleys are dark. Sheep don't valleys. Valleys are scary places because there's shadows in valleys. You lose the sun more quickly in valleys. And that was a mountainous territory. And what does say to us. Do you realize mountain tops are great. But you can't grow anything on a mountain top. Where do you grow stuff. In a valley. Where do you find water. In a valley.",

And now you're going to get some water. sometimes the most difficult, darkest times in our life, we hate and we say, what are you doing. He's saying, I'm bringing you to a valley to restore your soul. I don't know if you've gone through that, but I sure have on many occasions. And when I go into a valley, I say, you're a bad shepherd. I don't you now. We are not on speaking terms. And he says, hang around. And after a while, I surrender. And that valley, which I thought would destroy me, fed me. And it made me stronger and it restored my soul. let me go on to the next one. Even though I walked through a valley of the shadow of death. And what that means is, it was the deepest, darkest valley. It was the worst valley. It was a valley that felt scary that the sheep went in there a good, calm, sex trauma person with a worst case scenario going, I'm gonna die. That's where they went in their thinking. And again, you go, I don't my shepherd. I don't think he's a good guide. And sometimes 's guidance in our life seems wrong or very confusing. And seems a little bit cruel. But says, just wait a while. Hang in there. And again, if there's no pasture anywhere else, you go to a valley. Now here's what does. A shepherd had two instruments that they carry. Rod and a staff. And a rod was a little billy club. And it was a short thing that the shepherd would use as a weapon to protect against wild animals. He would put a rod on the sheep. He would use it to give the sheep a little smack if they needed it, some discipline. And he would use it just to count the sheep. But that's not the main thing that he uses in the valley.",

You can't see me, but you can feel that I'm here. I'm giving you a little reminder of my presence. And as soon as the sheep felt that staff touch their side, they would relax. The shepherd's here. He hasn't abandoned me. He knows I'm here. He can see me. Even though I can't see him, I have a good shepherd. Now there's one other thing I want you to notice. It started out, the is my shepherd.

Sheep don't trust. what happens in the early days, a sheep goes, I see that you're my shepherd. I don't trust you. I don't think you're smarter than me. And some sheep would be particularly rebellious. And they would not follow their shepherd. what a shepherd would do, not to be cruel, he would break the leg of that sheep. Then he would set it, and then he would carry that sheep on his shoulders over the next month. And I got a picture of that for you. There you go. And what would happen is that leg was healed. And what I'm feeling is every day he was close to the shepherd. Every day the shepherd would talk to him. Every day the shepherd would just chat about stuff. And pretty soon the sheep was going, I this guy. what, this guy knows what he's doing. And when it came time to take the splint off and put the sheep back on the ground, that sheep was the closest to the shepherd. He never strayed because he had gotten to know the shepherd. I think the breaking of the lamb's leg is the greatest illustration of addiction. Because what was happening in your life. You were saying F you to everybody. You were rebelling. Who needs. Who needs anybody. I'm my own boss. I'm doing it my way. And said, I'm going to do it my way. And you're going to do it my way. Let me give you this little thing called addiction. And it's going to take you to a place where it breaks your leg. And what will happen when your leg is broken. You go, I think I need you. And , I need you to carry me. And carried you for a while. Now some of you, maybe he didn't carry you long enough. Because as soon as you got back on the ground, you said, , I'll take over again. See you later. And you have to go through that. And you have to go through that. And you have to go through a few more broken legs until finally you go, I can trust this.",

And that is a whole big topic. if you've been in a relationship with a narcissist, the ideal thing for you to do is to end it and then have no contact. Because you want to know what happens next. Because you want to know what happens if you allow contact to a narcissist. That means I have another chance. They're listening to me. I can plant a seed in their brain. I can twist their thinking. I have an opportunity. And they will do that. And if they've beaten your self-image down, you'll listen to it. And it will influence you. no contact is the ideal. Now you might be in a place where you can't have no contact because you have kids together. you have to have some contact. the term that is used for what your response should be is called, be a gray rock. I don't know if you've heard of it, but just stop and think about it. What color are rocks. Gray. be a gray rock means don't stand out. Blend in. if they say, how are you doing. You say, fine. They're waiting for you to ask how they're doing. And you don't even ask them how they're doing because you don't care. Because you're not going to give them an opportunity for a second to say one thing that might influence your thinking. gray rock means do not stand out by saying stuff or asking questions. Because if you don't stand out, be almost unidentifiable to them. What I'd say after being in this field of counseling for the last 15 years, that is very wise advice.",

He wants to see all Jews killed. his goal as the -hand man to the most powerful man in the world is to get the Jewish people destroyed. And then the second key point is as you read the book of Esther, is not mentioned once. That's significant because the point is this. It looks is totally uninvolved. Here's a crazy man who hates Jews, who gets the king to give him permission to destroy all Jews. And you go, where are you,. Why aren't you stopping this. And doesn't seem to do a thing. But then as you read the book, you go, man, there's a lot of coincidences in this book. And you go, I say to people, is it odd or is it. When you get a coincidence. And when you get too many coincidences, you start to go, somehow there's in here doing something. I don't fully understand it. here's what you're going to see. is not going to violate one thing. He's going to do one human decision. But somehow, He is going to stop the destruction of the Jews and bring good out of all of this mess. And that's what I want to show you tonight. It's a fascinating story. And I hope I can do it justice. The next thing that I want you to see is Esther. If you were to look at the early part of her life, it was complex trauma, trauma big time. Everything in her life was full of tragedies. And I think as a young Jewish girl who grew up hearing about the of Israel, she could have easily become cynical and bitter and jaded and rebellious and say, I want nothing to do with that. He hasn't helped me. He hasn't been here for me. And this girl, I think, went through a time where she was probably struggled with bitterness or became very bitter towards , was convinced He wasn't trustworthy, and that maybe He didn't even love them, that He had abandoned them. And she's got a crisis of in the midst of all of her trauma.",

You have to deal with your shame stuff, before you have the strength to resist this list. , first thing, is abusers don't come and show their true colors on day one. They come wearing a very crafted, crafted mask. And they are great at being a salesman, and fooling you, and selling you on a fantasy, phony product, and making you think it's real. And part of the journey in spotting an abuser, is not getting sucked in by the salesman, waiting long enough until that mask slips a little bit, and you see the true colors, and then you go, nope, not going any further in this relationship. they start charming, and they can build up your self-esteem. They sense you have shame, and what do they do in their salesman role. They tell you how wonderful you are. They tell you how much they adore you. They want to spend every minute with you. Now understand this, that's only for the first few months. Then after that, that begins to change. The second thing is, they will try to rush you in the relationship. You're saying, I got to go slowly here to see their true colors. They go, I can't let them go slowly, because my salesman act only lasts long. I got to rush it here, and put pressure on them, and usually the thing that they lean on, to try to get you to speed stuff up, is sex. If I can get them in bed, and we have great sex, then I can get them to speed things up. what they are actually doing, is grooming you, and what we mean by that, is they are breaking down your natural caution, and your natural hesitance to trust somebody new. They're breaking that down, to get you to trust too early. And that's what we call grooming. Once they start to get you, and you're starting to get, you're starting to show interest in them, they will then begin to try to isolate you, from your other supports. they want to be the only person in your life, that carries influence with you.",

You might be able to delay their heading into deeper addiction, but they're headed that way now because they're not liking themselves as an abuser. They're totally discontent, full of anger. And they're heading there. You can't prevent that by staying with them. All they're doing is dragging you with them. And what you have to realize often, is somebody else might be able to help them, but I'm not the person. I'm not strong enough to do that.

You've trained them that if they say no, they can manipulate you over time to get you back and the next time they're going to try harder and it's going to be harder to enforce your boundary. think it through carefully. Third thing, be prepared for backlash. A narcissist doesn't somebody saying no to them. A narcissist doesn't somebody saying, we're done, I don't want to be around you. That makes them look bad. they can go on the attack. Be prepared for that and that's got to be part of your plan. I'm going to stick to my guns even though World War III erupts. And then be prepared for a variety of emotions that you're going to go through once you end it. Yes, you'll be angry for a while but then you're going to miss them. And then you're going to feel love for them. Then you're going to feel guilt. Then you're going to be confused. And then you'll go through a time of grief.

If they go to REACT knowing that you're going to wait for them and they go through REACT and they come back, how do they did it for the reasons. Did they do it for you or did they do it to get you back. Or did they do it for themselves or did they do it just to get you back. you're not going to ever know that they're going to do it for themselves until you're out of the picture.",

Usually, once you would try to get back together, it's too easy to go back to the old behaviors where you left off. And you all know each other's baggage. And it just is such a difficult thing. what I say to clients is this, you might not feel that you can say it's done forever. I get that. But at least agree that it's done for a long period of time.

If their parents were angry and abusive, they kind of picture as an angry. And that has a profound effect on how they approach. Second piece with this is I would think is.",

The second one is that when the parents don't want to get pregnant. And they do. It's an accident that the child can feel very unhappy. unwanted because the parents did not want that pregnancy. The missed time pregnancy, they wanted to get pregnant just not now. You can still see how the child could pick up some unwanted stuff. But then there's a second one and that is the parents wanted a boy, not a girl. And you are a girl or the other way around. And you just have always felt your parents wished you were a boy. You were not wanted. And then the third is if your mother died giving birth to you, all of a sudden your life cost her life and that makes you kind of unwanted. They'd prefer to have mother over you. those are the kind of things that can result in a child feeling unwanted. Hungarian psychoanalyst Sandor Ferenczi says this, these are the unwelcome guests. of the family. And then goes on to say someone who is not fully invited into the world. They seem visitors, outsiders who might leave at any minute. that's kind of that unwanted child. Now Drexel University Women Health Blog has given some interesting information about unwanted pregnancies. And they said that about half of the pregnancies in the U. S. are unwanted, unplanned, or unintended. again, they make the two categories of mistimed and unwanted. The risk factors for unintended pregnancies tend to be not always but tend to be people from a low social and economic status, mothers who are drug users, women who are men who are involved don't have as much education, women who are involved in the sex trade, or the type of contraceptive that was used or younger women. those are kind of the higher risk categories. But what they're also finding, this is where I really want us to think about is that they followed what happens with the children who come out of unwanted pregnancies and they're beginning to see that there's poor maternal and child outcomes.",

    "text": "They just develop this victim mentality. Poor me, my life sucks, everything's against me. And they just kind of wallow in this self-pity all the time, feeling sorry for themselves. And it's kind of their way of validating their own pain, but it just feeds off itself. Then in another direction, many people who are unwanted as a child, when they get into adult lives, they are drawn to people who are going to not want them. They are drawn to people who are going to fulfill their self-fulfilling prophecy that nobody will ever want me. they're, without realizing how, subconsciously drawn to people who will reject them, who will not want them. And they repeat the same message and reinforce it over and over again. Some, they go to. I need to get people to want me. they don't naturally want me, but could I do something that will get them to want me. some become people pleasers. If I just do whatever you want, will you then want me. that can come out of not being wanted. Others go, if I do everything perfectly, I'm a perfectionist, then will you want me. that's their brain's solution to not being wanted. Even if they get in a relationship. And the person seems to want them, they just aren't able to receive love into their soul. if you were an unwanted child, I hope this just helps make sense out of some of your life. But I also want you to realize that you can heal from this. This is complex trauma. And part of what we do all the time is really help people begin to get to that core shame. And the beliefs that came out of not being wanted. And begin to heal that and change that. And develop a connection with yourself and with safe people. It's a long journey, but it is a possible journey.",

You're walking on eggshells, then you make up and go back to the ideal stage. The honeymoon again. That wears down and then you have another conflict because nobody's dealing with anything. You have a blow-up and then you go back to the honeymoon stage again. you start a cycle of unresolved stuff. Where you have honeymoon, which gets shorter and shorter and shorter. And then blow-up, which gets more intense, more intense. And then after a while, it just all. Goes down the drain. that's the devalue stage. And that can go on for months and months. The third stage is what we call the discard stage or the replace stage. And that basically means they discard you and replace you with somebody else. they are at this discontent. You're no longer feeding their narcissism. You're no longer being the mirror that they need. they go and find a new person and they start to groom them. And as they groom them and love-bomb them and mirror them, that person just explodes with gratitude and feeds the narcissist all over again. that is what can begin to happen.

    "text": "This and the fear of being viewed as a burden. It gets in the way of intimate, healthy relationships. the consequences can be severe. let me just kind of develop how important it is to understand we need people. Because many people from complex trauma come into recovery determined, if I just get enough information, I can do this alone. If I just get enough tools, I can do this alone. But do you realize we can't do it alone. understand a couple things. Every organization, every organism is built where we need others. look at the human body. My nose can't say, I don't need the other parts of my body. My heart can't say, I don't need the other parts of my body. We are built as a body, as an organism, that we need all kinds of different parts to perform their functions. We need that if we're going to be healthy. You look at an organization. You need people with different skill sets who can bring different strengths. To that organization, if that is going to be a healthy, thriving organization. We're designed that we don't have all the skill sets. We need other skill sets. Take that further. In infancy, we have total dependence. As we move to adulthood, we move out of total dependence. But some people think adulthood should mean total dependence. , independence, the opposite of total dependence. But what I want you to understand, the healthy design is the infant is totally dependent. Adulthood is healthy interdependence. I'm not totally dependent, but I'm not totally independent. There's a healthy interdependence. Third, what I just shared about needs. If you think about it, why does a child, a baby, why are they totally dependent. Why do they have many needs. Why aren't they born with the ability to feed themselves, to walk, to talk. Because needs drive us to connect. And connection is what leads to true happiness. And needs are actually this ingenious thing that is designed to bring people together that they can experience the fulfillment of their deepest longing, which is healthy connection, they can experience it. needs are part of that. But then think of Western culture, Western society. We are becoming an increasingly fractured society where we are all about trying to be self-sufficient, where there is not healthy interdependence and connection.",

    "text": "And now if I ask for help, there's going to be a greater probability that they're going to say, sorry, we've got to set a boundary with you because you've caused much drama in our life. We're not going to go there. And you could create what you're trying to avoid. Now let me just switch to, let's say somebody comes to you and asks for help. Now, there's a couple of things you need to be aware of. the first thing is, think of it from the perspective of parenting. If my one-year-old asks me to help feed them soup, I do it because they're not yet capable of feeding themselves, of meeting that need. If my 20-year-old asks me to feed them their soup, I go, no, there's something wrong here. what I'm doing with that one-year-old is I'm asking them to help feed themselves. Yes, I'm meeting that need for them, but I'm also teaching them the tools that they learn how to feed themselves they eventually can feed themselves and not need me for that need anymore. And what you understand as a parent is child has many needs, but you teach them tools that they can meet more and more needs on their own, but you help them also recognize there's still going to be some needs, even as an adult, they'll need others for help. as I work with people, I want to ask, where are they at in their growth. Are they still kind of infant when it comes to their toolbox and their abilities. Or do they have the tools to feed themselves. that leads to a question. If I help somebody who's still at an infant and doesn't have the tools, they need my help. That's a good thing to do. But if I help somebody who has tools but is just not wanting to use them or is lazy, I would not be loving by doing it for them. I would be enabling them to not grow up, to remain stuck where they're at in their immaturity. when people come and ask me for help, I need to be able to ask, where are they at. Can they do it for themselves. Do they have the tools. If not, then I will help them.",

    "text": "If they do, I shouldn't help them, but kind of pressure them to use the tools that they have. The next thing that I ask is, as I've gotten to know this person, do they implement tools as they learn them. Or do they just acquire tools as academic knowledge but never implement them. And some people do that. And they're afraid to try and implement them because they're afraid they won't do it perfectly the first time. They're afraid they're going to fail. they learning about tools, they're just afraid to implement them. If I see that, then I know I would not be doing a favour to them by doing it for them. I need to resist doing it for them and pressure them to do it themselves. Another thing that I ask sometimes when people come and ask for help with their needs is, this need that they have, is it because they're just lazy. Is it because they keep procrastinating on all their responsibilities. if I help them, am I going to be reinforcing laziness, procrastination. Those are things I have to consider as. Another thing that often happens is, people have such a great fear of making the wrong decision, that they're afraid to do it. That they come to me and they want me to help them think through decisions. And I do that. Here's the pros, here's the cons. And that's an important part for them learning how to think and learning how to weigh out different options. And I don't mind doing that. But some will keep coming to me whenever they have any decision that they need to make and I begin to realise, they want me to make their decision for them. Because they're afraid that if they make the decision, they might make a mistake. But if I make it, there's a greater chance they won't make a mistake. And I go, they're dependent on me to do their thinking for them. That's not healthy. And I need to be aware of that. Some people, they come to me wanting help and I give them help. And then they just heap me with praise. They validate me over and over. And I begin to realise with some, they came to me for help, but what they're doing now is more than just appreciation.

    "text": "That's where the one can feed the other. Now there's another piece that comes out of this in complex trauma. And it's false guilt. And it's a poorly trained conscience. And that's where a child is made to feel guilty for something they didn't do wrong. dad says, I drink because you're such a bad kid. now the child feels guilty every time he drinks. And the child feels guilty every time their dad drinks because they think I've done something wrong. Or I'm angry and it's your fault. dad might be angry because they did something that triggered his anger. But he's angry because of his stuff. But the child now feels guilty every time the parent has a negative emotion. It's my fault. My parent is going through that emotion. And I'm going through that emotion that way. And false guilt gets blended in. And you can't resolve false guilt because you didn't do anything wrong. But you feel guilty anyways. And that feeds into shame even more. hopefully that helps you understand the difference between guilt and shame. Guilt about what I do. Shame about who I am. let's move into this topic of how does a child develop an identity. subconsciously a child comes into the world. Who am I. That's the question. I don't have a clue who I am. And am I lovable. Do I have value. Do I matter to anybody. Does anybody delight in me. Do I have anything to offer. All of those are happening subconsciously in a child. How do they get an answer to those questions. They do it by how do the significant people in my life treat me. Respond to me. What do they say to me. do I matter becomes do I matter to them. If I don't seem to matter to them, then I don't matter. Am I lovable. , am I loved to them. By them. Am I lovable to them. If I don't seem to be lovable to them, I must not be lovable. they get the answers to those questions based on how mom and dad treat them. That becomes their basis of answering those questions.

And they begin to form their identity based on how mom and dad treat them. a good metaphor for this is to think of a mirror. a child comes in the world and they don't have a clue what they look physically. How do they get the picture of how they look. They look in a mirror and it reflects back to them a picture of who they are. A child comes into the world and they don't know who they are internally. How do they get a picture. They look at the mirror of mom and dad. And mom and dad reflect back to them a picture of who they are. But if mom and dad are messed up, they're getting a distorted picture back. And what you begin to see is shame is a picture that a child develops about themself that is all based on lies. It is based on distortions. But to the child, it's the truth. Because that's how mom and dad are treating them. let me take that example further. I don't know how many of you have been to a house of mirrors where you go in and see all these distorted mirrors. let's just imagine that you're six feet tall and very thin. And you walk into a house of mirrors and you look in the mirror and you're four feet tall and four feet wide. , take that picture and put that into a complex trauma family that a child grows up and the only mirrors they have are distorted mirrors.

And they develop the shame message. , now let me go into some new stuff. Let me go into some new stuff here. If a child grows up in a home where every time they offer their opinion, it kind of gets laughed at, they begin to get the message, you're stupid. You don't matter. Your opinion doesn't matter. If parents roll their eyes, if brothers and sisters roll their eyes, or snicker whenever they say something, it sends that message back to them. If they were told by parents, or brothers and sisters, you'll never amount to anything, you can't do anything , you're such a failure, that's a powerful, powerful message that shapes their core identity. Families that find humor at others' expense, teasing, name-calling, practical jokes, where the other person is always made to feel embarrassed, stupid, laughed at, that sends that message to them. Or you get families with kids come home with straight A's and one B, and the parents don't congratulate them for the straight A's, they go, how come you got a B. it doesn't matter how good they try, how hard they try, it's never good enough in their family. They can never be good enough. And that sends the exact same message. Or parents that say, why can't you be your brother. Why can't you be your cousin. Or father, when father is close to you day and night. It doesn't make sense. It's your fault that their kid is one step too far away from them. If you're too impressed, their needs aren't consistently met. The next one is huge. Children when they're struggling or they're excited about something and they just want to connect with their parents and tell them about it or cry or get help and they try to connect but the parents aren't wanting to connect. That sends the message you don't matter. You're not valuable enough to connect with. Or families where you can't express all your emotions. you're going to keep crying.",

They need to get away from that circumstance and go find something else to do. that's why people all sudden want to do a mindless numbing task. They can think of all kinds of little jobs they'd to do just to distract themselves. Others. When they're in a very painful situation and the topic is scary or stressful. They divert attention of everybody else from the topic onto themselves. And they go look at me and here's what's going on in my life. And all of a sudden if I can be the center of attention then the painful topic isn't the center of attention. Others as soon as the topic is getting too painful they can't sit still. They get extremely agitated. They got to get up. They got to move their foot starts dancing because the pressure is building inside. And sometimes they'll get angry get very irritable and lash out at people. That's their way of trying to avoid that topic. those are just some other things that can happen for people. The brain fog is a symptom. the danger is to think. I just need to fix the symptom. If you try to fix the symptom without fixing the real issue, which is there's too much stress in your life now. You're never really going to fix the brain fog. understand the real issue is the stress brain fog is the symptom. Now there's going to be some things we can do to help with that symptom in the moment. But the key thing is you have to begin to look at the. Stress of your life. That's the key problem. That's what's got to get attention. That's what's got to change. That's what's got to get fixed.",

Or if you had a family where there's constant fighting, conflict, anger, tension, often a child thinks the way to help my family is to not have needs. Because when I have needs, it just creates more anger and tension. Or maybe you were a child and you were worried about who was a burden because you had a chronic illness. You were a sick child.

I must be incompetent. If people roll their eyes when you talk, if people laugh at you because they hurt you, or they encourage you wet your bed, or that you stutter, you all take all of those messages in and say, man, I am not a good person.

playing video games and if you have to sit there your legs just the bouncing because you can't your antsy you can't live with yourself and you need constant distractions because living in your own skin is terrible existence that's how we the first thing their second priority is to hide now the what we do from there is this nobody wants to walk around feeling they don't have any value there's something in us that is driven to I want to feel valuable I want to feel that I have importance we begin to try and create things that give us a sense of feeling important and everybody's different in what they do but let me give you some of the things that people do to try to deal with their shame and try to feel value if you were born to be one of those people that just naturally has a very beautiful face and a very beautiful body you probably if you're a girl you're probably in school had a lot of guys asking you out for dates a lot of guys drooling over you and and you're looking around and saying nobody else is getting this kind of attention huh I'm pretty hot that just makes me feel valuable now what has happened in your mind is my value does not come from Who I am or my character my value comes from my body and my looks and now what do you have an obsession about I have to maintain this body and then when you get 40 and 50 you're having major crises because it's getting harder to do all the nips and tucks and maintain the body the thing that gave you value is disappearing but you see how that works some go I might not have as hot a body as Miss hottie over there but I can get more guys to sleep with me than she can and I'm better in bed and I'm going to use my promiscuity my ability in bed to start keeping track that I've got more people that I've slept with and I am hotter in bed that's my value and if you grow with that and all of a sudden you come into recovery and you go I think I need to change a lot of my sexual behavior that's a crisis because now you're going then what will give me value because that was the source of my value huge issue some you just get the money and the possessions and you use that to get a lot of money and you could have give you a sense of value or your position your career that becomes what gives you a sense of value and that if that's the case for you that's why retirement is a huge crisis for somebody because now they're not working and that's what gave them value and now who are they weren't a human being before they were a human doing and now that they're not doing they don't have a sense of value a big issue some people get into religion and they're going to be the best person in that religion and they'll get their value from that others are say I can't compete in any of those arenas I don't stand a chance but man I can be bad I'm gonna be the baddest of the bad and that will give me my sense of value but you want to know what happens when you go down that road of finding value it seems to be working but it always leaves you having to prove yourself every time a new person moves into the school that's good looking all of a sudden you're I got to prove that I'm hotter than them and you got all of that and you got insecurities start to happen jealousy all of those things it does not properly solve the value issue it does not properly solve the shame problem the next thing that some people do to try and get a sense of value is to go into relationships but the problem is that shame always messes up those relationships let me we're gonna save this to go into detail in a couple weeks but let me just mention it very briefly a person in shame the worst thing to be is alone because if I'm all alone without being in a relationship that seems to prove I'm not lovable nobody wants to be with me and therefore the goal becomes I always have to be in a relationship and some of you understand that and if a relationship starting to fall apart you won't end it till you got another one ready to go you can move from one to the other and that becomes a very important thing I have to be in a relationship that proves and confirms I'm desirable and I'm not lovable and I'm lovable others what happens because of the shame is I long for intimacy but I'm scared of intimacy if I take this wall down and I let them in to start to know me I'm pretty sure they're going to abandon me and you want to have an intimate relationship but you're afraid to you live with a fear that they're going to leave you and that fear of abandonment causes you all kinds of games that you play in order to try and stop that or test them and then it causes all kinds of jealousy because what you're thinking is once they find out what I'm really they're going to find somebody else because bottom line you feel you're not much of a catch where I to put it this way you feel you're chopped liver and I think we all have in success you always have a chance to shock yourself but I mean you do and it's in our character to move and things matter there is no doubt it do it usually it doesn't help if they only taken a beating it does it help if it makes you balls a bunch of makeup媽 and who this guy has was my Nearly two years something to flour go and say I'm sick I'm sick I'm dislocated but it's eventually we'll get better yes but you've got to come back to yourself to understand you understand women when you voltage young for good now we see it's more self-reliant to love to control them they don't leave you for that steak and it gets really messy and it begins to break the relationship down the other thing that happens is when you have shame you always end up feeling inferior and you're thinking is if I could just feel superior then that would be the answer to my shame and most relationships of people with shame are people who are always inferior superior somebody's always trying to be better than the other and you want to know something you cannot have a healthy intimate relationship if those are the dynamics and we'll look at that in more detail and the sad result of all of the shame is it messes up relationship but what is interesting and I still don't know that we have a perfect way of explaining it but a shame person always seems to attract other shame people some people will say to me all the time why do I always attract losers then they're beautiful people in many ways but it's because there's shame and a person with shame is an antennas out there that says oh I can smell another person with shame and I know the dynamics for how that those relationship work and then before it you're in a relationship that starts out it's the most wonderful relationship in the world because you both have got masks on and as soon as those masks are coming off and the real person comes out it's World War three and it's not a pretty sight let me end with this how do you begin to heal from shame it's one thing to understand it to analyze the problem but where do you go to start to change that my hope for everybody here if you grew up with a distorted mirror that said you're four feet tall and four feet wide is that someday you can look at an accurate mirror that says you're six feet tall and thin and say that's the truth I believe it but that is a journey to get there and let me just say this there's a couple basics I'm not going to expand on it I'm just gonna give them to you quickly but number one hang around healthier people who will be more accurate mirrors that will reflect to you and a more accurate picture about your value and how lovable you are here's why I emphasize that what happens for many people in recovery is they're afraid to make new relationships with people they go back to old friends or they go back to unhealthy family and you want to know what going back to unhealthy family is it's not healthy family it's not healthy family it's not healthy family it's going back to a distorted mirror and you could be in treatment I've seen this happen over and over where you're starting to feel better about yourself you're starting to heal from your shame and you go home to visit family and mum raises an eyebrow and makes a comment and all of a sudden you feel that person has no value and is a pain and a burden and not good enough it all comes rushing back and you need to begin to think about putting up to heal

And I just add that for many people, the spiritual relationship is an important piece in healing at this level of starting to get the proper messages about who I am. The next thing is you have to start on a journey that says, I received a whole lot of distorted messages. Some of them might have a little bit of truth about who I am, but much of it was lies. And I need to begin to sort out what is the lie that I was told about me. What are the tapes that play in my head that say I'll never amount to anything. I need to identify the lies in there and begin to replace it with the truth. And that is a journey and it is a journey. A slow but steady progress type of journey. The next thing is maintain a clear conscience. You want to know what happened when you're feeling really good about yourself and you're starting to say, I me a little bit. And then you do something that you really hurt somebody else and your conscience is eating you up. It brings all the shame feelings back. you need to keep doing that stuff that keeps that conscience clear and you're dealing with the truth. You're dealing with the truth and you're dealing with the damage that you've done in the lives of others. And then there's value in serving because as you begin to help in various ways, you begin to learn where you have value. You begin to learn. I'm really good at helping people in that way. I'm terrible in this way. But you begin learning where your strengths are. And then the next thing that I think is absolutely essential is you need to talk about your shame stuff with people and with your friends and your family. And I'll give you a few examples of people who are safe. People who will accept you. The fear is if I talk about this, these people are going to make fun of me. They're going to judge me. They're not going to want anything to do with me. You want to know what usually happens though. When you get honest about how you really feel, people appreciate it.",

    "text": "tonight we're back on this healthy tools. I said in the very first talk in this series that if a person is going to deal with their addiction and their complex trauma, basically you got to get healthy. two part or three parts to getting healthy, the first is self-awareness and that's understanding all the unhealthy ways I act and the patterns of unhealthy that are taking place in my life and starting to be aware of that and then secondly I have to learn what healthy looks and thirdly I got to learn tools to get to healthy. that's what this series is about and tonight we're coming to the topic of money and what I'm really focusing on is how do we meet the needs that we have in healthy ways and the last two weeks we talked about how do we meet the need for healthy ways and the last two weeks we talked about how do we meet the need for And the last two weeks we talked about how do we meet the need for food and pleasure and in order to get food and sometimes to get pleasure you got to spend money. money isn't not actually a first need but it's a need in order to get some needs met and money is a huge issue and I want to break it down three different ways. First is money in general for people no matter how healthy they are is a challenge. Money is this thing that's just a necessary part of life. You can't live without it but it is very tricky to manage. It might seem it's kind of an insignificant thing but you begin to realize that it is connected to just about everything we do and we can go wrong with money in a thousand different directions. And the number one cause of conflict that studies say in marriages today is that we need to be healthy. money is money. it causes all kinds of issues. money is very easy to misuse. And it's also very easy to develop the wrong attitude toward no matter who you are. What I have learned over the years is if I want to know the priorities of a person watch what they spend their money on.",

    "text": "It seems to solve my problems, but it only makes it worse. Exactly a drug. And money is something that you can easily become addicted. the wrong attitude toward money is called greed. And I want to talk about that. Greed is wanting more money, living to get more money, thinking that having more money will make me happy and will meet all of my needs. Now some people have said to me over the years, I don't have greed after I'm poor. And I go, let's just see if we can figure out how do we tell if we have greed. Realize that some of the wealthiest people in the world are super greedy and some of the poorest people in the world are just as greedy. They just haven't had the opportunity. It doesn't mean they don't have the attitude. what are some of the indicators. Now this is tricky,. what I'm going to do is give you different things that could be indicators, but they aren't necessarily indicators. a workaholic. That could definitely be greed. Somebody saying, I need more, I need more, I need more. But that could also be somebody that just says, I've got lots of children and I have to pay the bills and I've got to be a responsible adult, I've got to work extra hours as much as possible. that could be a good thing. Then you go the other extreme, a cheapskate. some of you, oh, I used to say about my grandma that she was cheap that when she opened her wallet and she fell out, the queen blinked. Because it hadn't seen the light for a long time. In case you didn't get that joke. a cheapskate could be somebody that just manages their money very. And they're very careful not to waste money, to save money, and some people are going to look at them and go, what a cheapskate. Other people who are a cheapskate are driven by greed. I'm not going to spend a penny on you because I want it for me to create wealth. that can be a greed. A hoarder. A hoarder can be greed, but do you realize that hoarding, for the most part, comes out of complex trauma. It is a person who's gone through abandonment.",

    "text": "And at some point in the child's life, they realize, dad loves me as long as it doesn't interfere with his money. And then the money becomes more important than me. how much that hurts a child when they realize dad loves his car more than me. Dad loves getting money more than me. That is devastating. And when you are greedy, at some point in your life, at some point in a relationship, your greed will trump loving other people. And your greed will come before loving them. And it will do a lot of damage. let's go to how do we learn to manage money, have a healthy relationship with money. Again, this is one of the things in our culture that our culture teaches an awful lot about, I'm not going to go through every healthy thing. You can go to budgeting classes, etc. There's lots of different stuff out there to help you. But do learn money management. And when you manage money, there's three things really. Saving, spending, and giving. that's three different areas for money. And then what I find with many people is distinguish between a need and a want. I used to do a thing with clients where I gave them a list of things and I put need, want. And they were to check which was a need and which was a want. And some people, everything was a need. A 55-inch television, need. And just keep on going down, need, need, need. And they did not know how to distinguish between a need and a want. And that becomes very important in figuring out how to manage money. Secondly, work at a budget. Get somebody to help you. I used to do an exercise with clients where they would take how much money they got every week, two weeks, whatever, and then they would have to go through every expense they had. Cigarettes, food, all the different things. Do you want to know where most money went that they didn't even realize. Eating out, coffee. And all of a sudden they began to realize, wow, I can't believe how much money I'm spending here. And if you do that, that becomes a very important thing. , now I've seen people that have made the best budgets in the world and never followed them. you need to develop a self-control.",

    "text": "I thought I would take you through this series to show you kind of how messed up they were that you would begin to see yourself and see kind of how responded to all of their complex trauma. what we did last week is I talked about the very first thing did. I picture as this perfect therapist, counselor, and I'm sitting there going, what's the first thing He did in the very first session with these new clients that He's got who have severe complex trauma. And we said last week that a person with complex trauma is not going to heal unless they learn to trust. But the problem is people who have lived all their life not trusting, that's the last thing they want to do. Is trust. And trust becomes something they need but they resist. And forces them into situations where they see how He faithfully provides for them even though they don't want to be in those positions. And He takes them to things where they see His power, His commitment, His faithfulness, His love. All of those are very important. And I say, what's the first thing wants them to see. And that's what we're going to look at tonight. here's what I, if you want to read, starting in Exodus 13, what you're going to find is the writer only picks certain scenes. There are thousands of different things happening, but he just picks one here, one here, one here. And I go, why did he pick those particular scenes. Why did he pick those scenes. Why did he pick those particular events. And as I think about it, I think he's wanting us to show what had to do in what order to bring about healing in traumatized people. what's the second thing that 's going to do. He's going to show them how sick they are. Guess what I do when people come to React and Finding Freedom. Show you how screwed up you are and you'll all love me for it. Another way to look at it, step one, if you're going to get healthy, you got to get to know you can trust him. Step two, if you're going to get to healthy, you got to get to know yourself. And people are not going to change unless they know they're sick.",

When they see how sick they are. is going to do the next event to help them see how sick they are. Now, again, I want to say this up front. This is not something we all get in line and clap for that he's showing us how sick we are. We it when shows us good things about ourself. But when we get presented with an accurate picture that shows our ugliness, for most of us it takes us to shame or we just don't want to go there. It's too painful, brings up too much stuff. But what is saying is, I'm not taking you there to leave you there as if pain all by itself was a good thing. I'm taking you there because that has to be the place you begin if you're ever going to change. we're not going to stay there. We're going to go there, get an accurate picture, and that's going to create a hunger and a motivation to change. And that's what 's going to do. let me read you what happened. Moses led the people of Israel away from the Red Sea. remember last week they went through the Red Sea and they moved out into the desert of Shur. They traveled in the desert for three days without finding any water. Now again, what you have to understand is a couple of things. There were about three million people, but we're also told that they brought sheep, cattle, and goats. you can imagine that they brought water with them as they left Egypt. They brought enough water to get them through a couple days. But do you imagine how much water you would need to carry with you to feed a couple sheep and cows and your family. A lot of water. they would run out very quickly. it says, when they came to the oasis of Merah.",

We found water and it's bitter. What would a good complex trauma person do at that point. , here's what they did. They complained and they turned against Moses. They blamed the leader for what was going on. And what are we going to drink, they demanded. they are lashing out. They are angry. And you can imagine the noise, the drama, as all these frustrated people, are getting up from getting a drink of this bitter water, and they're mad, they're disappointed. And Moses cries out to the for help, and the showed him a piece of wood. Now what's a complex trauma person going to do when Moses comes walking along with, here's the solution to our problem, and throws a piece of wood in the water. You're going to get more mad at him. But Moses threw it in the water, and this made peace. The water, good to drink. Sometimes the solutions we're looking for come from what seems dumb, dumb things. And it takes humility and trust to begin to trust some of that. it was there at Merah that the set before them the following decree or law. He said, If you will do what is in 's sight, obeying His commands, keeping all His decrees, and following His commandments, you will be from the evil of the world. And the said to Moses, I will not make you suffer any of the diseases I sent on the Egyptians, for I am the that heals you. And Jehovah means I am the that heals you. It became a title for.

Because she crossed a river and she went with her husband to Medjin, very bottom in three days. Three days early, here's the point I want you to get. Not just does complex trauma cause you to have emotional roller coasters. It does. But three days earlier, if you were to interview the people coming out of slavery, here's what I think many would have said. They would have said, why we have much pain. It's because of slavery. Now that we're out of slavery, our life is going to be good. We are going to be happy. Our life is going to be wonderful because slavery was our problem. How many of you have come out of addiction and said, addiction's my problem. As soon as I get sober, all my problems are going to go away. Everybody's going to love me. My partner's going to love me.

And how do you get a person who thinks that they're not going to get what they want. How do you get a person who thinks that they're not going to get what they want. How do you get a person who thinks they're healthy and that the external circumstances were the cause of their problems and they don't see their own unhealthiness. How do you get them to see it. You give them a bitter experience. Do you want to know what happens in bitter experiences. It exposes who we really are. Do you want to know what happens when everything is smooth.

I want it to be a bitter experience that makes you better. And that is the choice that we have. let me just comment on this stick. I think there's two or three things that are important. Number one, I already mentioned, sometimes the things that you need to get healthy seem stupid. I don't know how many of you people have said to you, you should go and try this thing and go, it's stupid. And you're smarter than everybody, you should know. And what you have to realize is that sometimes the things that seem stupid, there's something in them that brings healing. And we have to be open to that. Second thing, I think the stick is also saying was going to do his part, but he required Moses to do his part. that healing wasn't just a one-way thing where said, sit on the operating table, I'll magically heal you, and you'll get up, and you'll be perfect. No, says, you got to do your part. This isn't just me doing my part, you got to do your part. But there's a third thing. Do you realize that the problems of the started with the tree in the Garden of Eden. And then, in the New Testament, we are told that the solution to all of our problems is another tree, the one died on. And I think, and many people think, that all of these stories here with Israel, each one tells us a little bit that says is coming. He's the final solution. And the stick, the tree that Moses threw in, is saying there's going to be another tree that's going to be the solution to a lot of your problems. Final thing, the tree that Moses threw in, is saying, there's going to be another tree that's going to be the solution to a lot of your problems. And , is this the simple thing I want to say.",

As long as you avoid, as long as you try to stuff them down, deny them, say it doesn't bother me. Those wounds are going to keep bleeding into your life today. And then finally develop a mindfulness. And there's a couple of things we mean by mindfulness. There's a couple of things we mean by that. First of all, develop an inventory time a couple times a day where you go, how am I doing stress-wise. Where's my head at. What's my mental health. What are the main emotions I'm feeling now. you keep track of if the stress is building, if your head space is still good. develop those inventories. And then. If you go, my head space isn't good, what do I need to do about it. If my stress is building, what do I need to do about it. And then you go to curiosity. when you find yourself triggered, you go, what was that about. instead of getting down on yourself that you were triggered, and you went back to some maybe some old behaviors, you go, what's going on here. Oh, that's connected to that. Now I know what I need to do. understand this. Attempt. And the trigger today points to an unhealed wound from the past. A trigger is actually a sign on the road with an arrow that says you need to go here and do some work and some healing. And develop that curiosity about yourself, about what's happening. What's this trigger all about. And you can learn and grow from it. Let me end by just saying this. Dr. Bruce Perry went to New Zealand and met with the Maori indigenous people. And they wanted him as a consultant to talk about healing methods for trauma and just healing in general. After he spent a week with them, they talked to him and what they said to him was impactful for him. And it validates and reinforces much of what I teach. But what they said to him was this.

I walked away from at the time of his greatest need. I denied that I even knew him. And I thought I had failed too greatly, and I thought would never want to use me again. But Mark, understand this. How great leaders respond to you does not necessarily mean that's how feels about you. Don't base your perception of self just on what other people say. Look at what says about you. And took me after my failure, and taught me through that, and made me the leader I am today. I think he wants to do that with you as. I would you on my team. I would you to work with me.

Rejected. All of those things. they can come in two ways. They can come from people or they can come from events. let's begin with the triggers that people can produce in you. let's say somebody asks you to do a job. And you do it for them. And when they look at the job you do, you can see disappointment in their eye. What just happened inside of you. Your shame got triggered. And all of a sudden you put your head down. You feel insecure. You can't look the person in the eye. You can't wait to get out of there. And you beat yourself up all day long. That's what I mean by a shame trigger. anytime you see disappointment in somebody's eyes, that can be a powerful trigger. Another one is you feel that something is wrong. You feel that somebody is getting impatient with you because you're not catching on fast enough. they ask you to do something or they're trying to teach you a new skill. And you realize you're not catching on and you think they're getting impatient and you start feeling shame. Now some of that, they might not be impatient with you at all. But you grew up where mom got impatient with you. You didn't learn perfectly the first time. And you think everybody is going to be impatient with you unless you learn perfectly or do it perfectly the first time. you then read shame in where there is really no shame. It's just your past affecting you. The next one, I don't know if this is true of you, but some people when you look at somebody and you're in pain or you're struggling, and you look at them and talk to them and you see pity in their eyes, you go to shame. You don't feel that they love me or they care about you. You feel I'm not good enough because I'm struggling much and they pity me.",

    "text": ", next one, if you're talking with somebody, and they keep looking down at their phone, or you can tell their eyes are glazing over, they're not giving you their full attention, you can go to shame. And you think it's all your fault. Or if you hear anybody whispering, you're pretty sure they're talking about you. And you go to shame. Or if you hear two people laughing, you're pretty sure they're laughing at you. And you can go to shame. again, it might not be true at all, but that's where your brain goes because of your history. And what whispering meant and laughing meant when you were a child. Next one, when others do a task better than you. you get asked to do something, and then somebody else gets asked to do something. And what are you doing the whole time you're doing something. It's comparing yourself to that person. And you get to the end of it, and you realize they did a better job than I did, you can go to shame. Or you come up with the greatest idea in the world, and you come to me and say, I have a great idea for finding freedom, and then I don't follow your advice. Some of you can go to shame. Disrespect is one of the biggest shame triggers for people, but they don't realize it because they go to anger quickly once they're disrespected. But shame is a part of that. Any conflict with another person can create shame because you're thinking the reason we're having conflict is because I'm not doing anything. I must be doing something wrong. They're mad at me, anger or anybody that's angry at you can trigger shame. You might have somebody who you're in a serious debate with, and you're 100 sure you're , and they're 100 sure they're. let me give you an example from Kim and I. we're both pushing 60. Our memories aren't what they used to be. I'm pretty sure I told her something she's pretty sure I didn't. And we can argue for hours if we want to about it. Yes, I told you. No, you didn't. let's say she goes out and gets a whole bunch of proof somehow that I never told her. And that proof now proves me wrong.",

His brothers were in that famine up in Israel and they came down and Joseph saw them and then they moved down and he gave them a place in the delta for their sheep and it was a fertile place and it let them live kind of isolated and they were living in a place that was isolated from Egyptian culture that Israel was able to grow without being infected by a lot of the bad stuff of Egyptian culture. And over the next years they grew to be a nation of three million people. the Pharaoh that was part of Joseph and then after Joseph they died and a new Pharaoh came along who didn't know who Joseph was. All he knew is that they had three million people who were a threat because they weren't Egyptian they were a foreign people living in his land. And he felt threatened by them he decided to instigate a genocide and every baby boy born to a Jewish mom was to be killed. And he was going to wipe out the Jewish people by wiping out all the baby boys. And there was this one couple and they got pregnant. They were the Jewish slaves working as slaves didn't have birth control got pregnant and you can imagine the panic. Because the law is any baby boy born will be killed and they are freaking out. And somehow they're very close to and they have this sense that has allowed them to become pregnant because that baby in her womb is special. has a special plan for that baby. they instead of thinking how can we get rid of this baby it never comes to being born they go how can we protect this baby once it's born. And what they decide to do and you've probably heard the stories is they made this little basket out of bulrushes and they put tar around it would float in the night.",

I'm just spending time with my boy telling him about. Teaching him how to tie his shoes. How to deal with other people. How to be honest. Wow that's a waste of time. That's not very significant. You could be doing something much more impactful on our world. No I think wants me to just invest in this little boy. I'm going to pursue my dreams. You do whatever you want. that is what is going on. At some point Moses gets taken from his true mom and gets moved into the palace with his adopted mom. And then 80 years later he becomes the leader of Israel and changes the world. let me get you to think about a couple things. In the we are told Amran and Jacobed. Now we are not sure if that is saying that is what his parents' names were because it is not clear. It is possible it is not who his parents are. It could just be a relative. the point is we don't know who Moses' parents are for sure. And the point of that is this. If you go back through history and I have done this in my own life. Do you realize that some of the greatest changes in our world came through hidden people. People that nobody noticed. Do you realize there is a little shepherd boy that nobody wanted and all his brothers thought he was kind of useless and they stuck him with the sheep. He changed the world. And then this Moses guy. And then there was this weird guy that was out in the desert. And he ate grasshoppers and ate honey and just lived this really weird life. He helped change the world.

You want to know the thing about parenting. Moses' mother went through and father. You invest your life in these kids and you go, what kind of results are you seeing in your kids. Are they changing the world. No, they just learned to blow their nose by themselves. Wow, that's significant. Do when they start to make an impact on the world. After you've invested 20, 30 years in them. Then you start to see the impact. You start to see results. That means you go 20, 30 years of faithfully investing in them. Faithfully role modeling to them. Faithfully teaching them tools and helping them without seeing a whole lot of results. It is investment that you don't get a return on for a number of years. And that's how some of the work that asks us to do is to make a difference. Do you realize that most of the people that wrote the , they didn't know anybody would ever read what they wrote. David wrote some stuff just in his personal journal. He didn't think it would impact anybody. He didn't think it would help anybody. Now it has helped millions of people thousands of years later. They did not see immediate results during their lifetime. It was future generations that saw the benefits of what they did. And that we have to factor in. we've talked about sometimes huge doors swing on really small hinges. Sometimes world events swing on very small hinges. 99. 9 of the world was totally aware of a slave in Egypt and her little baby. Nobody cared about that part of the world. Nobody cared about the Jewish people there. Nobody thought they would ever amount to anything. Everybody wrote them off as insignificant. But they weren't. And it wasn't until 80 years later that all changed. , my point. We aren't qualified to measure whether what we're doing is significant or not.",

Maybe not in your lifetime. And we trust for that. , here's what I want you to understand. Big, big picture outside of this. let me take you away from Moses' parents. is wanting to raise up a leader to lead his people out of Egypt and he's wanting to change the world. How is he going to do that. He has to get somebody who understands Egyptian politics. Somebody that people in Egyptian politics would pay attention to. And they're not going to do that with just a Jewish person. how is he going to pull that off. Oh, bingo. Let's take a Jewish boy, have him adopted by Pharaoh's daughter he grows up in two worlds. And understands two worlds. And rubs shoulders in two worlds. Then, when I want to deliver Israel, he can march into Pharaoh's court and say, Grandpa, let my people go. I don't know if it's grandpa or not. But he could do that because he was known there. And that was what pulled off. In a magical, mysterious way. And , if you look at the people who changed the world, just take Paul, who changed the world. It's fascinating to me, he grew up a Jew in a Gentile world. he understood the Jewish world and the Gentile world. And he could bring the two together. You see that all over the place. if brought you up in a white home, but you're an indigenous person, you understand two worlds. Now maybe up to now, you have felt you didn't fit into either world. I'm sure Moses felt that way. But he understood both worlds. And had a purpose for that. And now, he could work in both worlds and bring them together. often takes people and makes them misfits, but they grow up in two worlds and through that can change a big part of the world.",

My mother just died, just over a month ago, in her 80's. My mom was shy, worse than I'm shy. My mom never, I never once saw her take a public role. I never once saw her teach, preach, in public, do anything that. My dad did all of that. She did all the organizing, budgeting, managing. She did a million jobs unseen by. Behind the scenes. You want to know when I was at the funeral. I said this, how do you measure greatness and godliness. Is it by great jobs and public eye. I said no.

No. And that's maybe what 's going to call you to. And I just hope you realize that doesn't mean you're insignificant in any way. Do we sleep together at your house anymore.

And that's what we're going to look at today. what then happens in a child where there's complex trauma is their focus is how do I survive. And then what do I do to get some of my needs met. And what happens is in survival mode, the child picks what they think will help them survive and get their needs met. And it seems to work. They seem to have come across the perfect solution. And they begin to do it and they keep doing it. And it seems to be giving good results until you get into your teens, your late teens, into adult life. And you begin to find out. That the coping skills that I thought were helping me are actually making my life worse. And instead of protecting me from getting hurt, they're causing me to get hurt even more. And that is the big picture of what we're going to look at. Now I want to just flip and give you a little bit around what's going on in the brain when you face complex trauma. if you can again think of it. You have your brain that there are two parts to it. You have the thinking part on the front. And it learns, it processes, it thinks through stuff logically. It evaluates stuff. That's the front of your brain. And then in the center of the brain we have what is known as the limbic system. Which is the doing part. It's the part that when you get kind of in a place of being afraid, you go fight, flight. That's the limbic part happening. That's how this works. If you take what I just told you at the beginning about a child being afraid. What will happen with that child is you have this limbic part that when you see danger, it becomes aroused. It becomes alert. It is kind of alarm system goes off and says, danger, danger. What happens when the parent sits down with the child and says, what. You don't need to be afraid. And they help the child think it through. Is they engage the front part of your brain and help you process the scary situation.",

But you successfully respond and say, I'm not going to run away and I'm not going to get angry and fight. I am going and you start to do new responses. You get the front of your brain engaged and you begin to learn other ways of handling it. you assemble a toolbox. that's what you're doing. that's what you're doing as you begin to try and deal with complex trauma is you begin building new brain circuits. But those are tough to build. Now, here's what happens for many, many people. You'll be building these new circuits. you'll get trauma or you'll get reminders of trauma. You'll get new experiences that feel danger. And you'll get pretty good at saying, what. I can handle this now. I can handle this. And you go and the new responses and life is going good. Here's a little thing we're learning about the brain. Let's say you get a whole bunch of bad day situations in one day. you get fired from your job. You come home and your dog's dead.

Because mom and dad didn't want to connect with me. as you come into adult life, your fear in forming relationships is rejection. Your belief under that fear is that if people get to know me, they will reject me. And therefore people will only connect with me if I wear masks, if I give up my needs, if I give up my desires, if I become a non-person, then they'll want to connect with me. Which is really no connection at all. what happens then to an anxious person when they get into a relationship is they don't get their needs met because they're putting those aside. Result of that, and a lot of this happens at a subconscious level, they're not happy. Their needs aren't met, there's an emptiness inside, there's a pain inside because of that. And their whole thought is, that person that I'm trying to have a relationship with is the one I need to meet my needs. they hyper-analyze every little detail of the relationship. let's say that you've been in a relationship and it's been going on really, really. And almost every day your partner's quite upbeat and quite warm. And then you wake up one day and you don't know up front that they got a headache. And they're just a little bit distant that day.

They're fulfilling their core belief that you're going to leave them. They've already decided that. Now they're just looking for evidence to support that. And the first little sign, it doesn't even have to be true, but it looks it might possibly be true. That fits their core belief. And they run with that. And that begins to cause them to obsess, to question, to analyze. And then they have to do things because now they feel more insecure. They have greater anxiety. now they start playing little games. They start playing little games with you to try and see if you're going to pull away more. all of a sudden they don't give you any attention to see if you'll chase them. And if you're not chasing them around, they go, see that proves they're pulling away from me. Or they give you all kinds of mixed messages. They don't return your phone calls to see how you'll respond. All of those things begin to happen. And it's a person acting out of an anxiety place with a core belief that if you get to know me, you'll reject me. some of you can relate to that. Then the flip side is the person that we call avoidant attachment. And this is the child that's tried to be involved with mom and dad, but mom and dad just neglect them. But the child doesn't want to become needy or full of anxiety. They harden themselves. And they go, I don't need anybody. I can do this on my own. And what they're trying to do is protect themselves from any future feelings of rejection. Because they're trying to say, I don't need anybody rejection doesn't bother me. this is the person that when they get in a relationship, they avoid closely. you got the anxious person wanting closeness, pushing for closeness. You got the avoidant person keeping you at arm's length. In their mind, their strength is that they are an independent, self-sufficient person. And that is more important to them than intimacy because intimacy to them feels neediness.",

And for many of them, they have trouble committing themselves to the things that they're doing. They're not committing themselves to relationships. they lots of casual relationships. They lots of romantic relationships. But that word commitment to them means lack of freedom, lack of independence, lack of self-sufficiency, which means I'm going to get smothered or engulfed by somebody else. And I'll lose me in the process. they avoid that kind of commitment. But if you get them to commit, once they commit, they to create kind of mental distance by focusing on their partner's flaws and pointing them out. Or they review with their buddies how great single life was and how great it was to have freedom and how they've got a ball and chain now, called their wife, that's holding them down. And they begin to put their marriage in that kind of language to create a distance again. they resist intimacy. The other person, the anxious person, is pursuing intimacy but overdoing it. those two types of things are happening. just as the anxious person was hypervigilant about whether the person was pulling away, signs of distance, the avoidant person is hypervigilant about the other person's attempts to control them. as soon as their partner says, would you do this for me, they get their back up.

And then the anxious person, the chaser, the pursuer, they need somebody to chase to feel that they're getting their needs met and getting attention and conquering somebody. you always end up typically in codependent relationships that come out of complex trauma a pursuer after a distancer, not wanting it to happen. Now, I want to take that a bit further because here's what I want you to understand. Do you realize if you were to take an anxious person or an avoidant person, a pursuer or a distancer, and say, have a relationship with this very healthy person, do you want to know what they'd say. Boring. They need the chase. They need the conflict. They need all of that compulsive behavior to feel alive. that's the need that is being met. And they're not ever attracted to a healthy person because that wouldn't meet that need for that adrenaline and the chaos and the conflict. they go chasing unhealthy people with the same shame issues, just two separate ways of responding to that shame, one anxious, one avoidant. But what I always want clients to understand is this. That might give you a rush to be in a chase or being pursued, but it always backfires. They never work out to be healthy. They never have healthy relationships. They always end up being full of conflict that they break down and become unlivable. Take that further. Do you realize that the anxious person and the avoidant person or the chaser and the pursuer never learned how to connect in a healthy way. they are both emotionally unavailable. they don't even know if they stopped and said, let's do this healthy. They don't know what healthy would look because they don't know how to connect. And you want to know what the chaser says to the avoidant. They're never emotionally available to me. You want to know what the avoidant one says. I'm afraid to talk to them because if I did, it wouldn't be about my stuff. They'd be start talking about their stuff.",

There's nothing that's going to get in the way of that. I want to give you a little different perspective. if you think of going on your first date, now most of you wouldn't think of going in your pajamas with your bed head happening and all of that. When you go on your first date, you want to go you're attractive to the other person. And then what you tend to do often consciously or maybe not even consciously is there are parts of you that are not even conscious.

They're great and I want a relationship with them. what has done is how do I get people to want a relationship with me. I want one with them. How do I attract them to me. He does two things. How do I make myself known. The first one we know about and hear most often about is He revealed Himself through the writings of the , what He is. But there's a second way and that is through creation. in Psalm 19 it says this, the heavens proclaim the glory of. And that word glory means the beauty of. It declares what is. It puts on display how wonderful He is. it's the skies display His craftsmanship. Day after day they continue to speak. Now what it's saying is, is that the skies, the stars at night, the galaxies, nature is always speaking. But then it says, without a word. they speak without a sound or a word.

    "text": "And , procrastination now is a way of trying to avoid what they think is going to be for certain failure. , what I want you to see is that for most people coming out of complex trauma, shame is a big part of procrastination. They feel not good enough. They feel they're going to fail anyways. They feel that they're a burden. They feel inadequate. They feel inferior. , don't try to accomplish anything. You're going to screw up. , shame is key. And really dealing with procrastination. The next thing is that a limbic brain child is a child that only thinks of, I want to do what gives me pleasure now. I want to do what's fun now. I don't want to do what's boring. I don't want to do what's hard work. And , the limbic brain naturally procrastination, especially if it involves hard work or something that's routine and boring. , if a child is not helped, to move from limbic brain to cortex, to begin to think about doing life in terms of what is healthy, thinking through long-term consequences, but they just continue to be dominated by their limbic brain, when they get to adult life, they're still going to be thinking of, I don't feel doing this. I just want to do something that's fun. And not think through long-term consequences. , the whole predominant limbic brain where a person's never grown into their cortex, as an adult, can still trip them up and cause them to procrastinate. Some children procrastinated because it was the only way they got attention from their parents. , their parents were too busy. Their parents never connected with them. Their parents were always irritated with them. And , the only way they got their parents full attention is when they put stuff off until there was a crisis. Then, their parents gave them their full attention. And , to a child, bad attention is better than no attention. , I'd rather get this kind of attention even though it's negative. Others learned to rationalize that, and they often got this from their parents, that their parents procrastinated because they worked better under pressure. And , if they left it to the last minute, then when they're under pressure, that's when they work the best. And , a child just learned to begin to rationalize.",

    "text": "To themself, I'm just doing this because I work better under pressure. And that became an issue. Even though now, when they're under pressure, it causes extra stress that's messing them up. It's hurting their relationships. They still use that rationalization. I think for some children who weren't given tools, they begin to fear becoming a responsible adult because a responsible adult has a lot of extra pressure on them. They can't just do what they want. They can't just live out of their limbic brain. And , a child sometimes begins to go, I'll just keep procrastinating because then nobody will expect me to grow up. Nobody will then set the standard and say, oh, they can fulfill that responsibility consistently. Now, we'll require them to fulfill that responsibility consistently. Another thing that comes out of complex trauma is some children try to become invisible. If nobody sees me, if I never make any demands, if I never put myself out there, then I'll never get hurt. And , when they're given responsibilities, that means that they're going to be noticed. That means they're going to put themselves out there. And , for an invisible child, they will often procrastinate as a way to try to remain invisible because taking on that responsibility is going to put them in the spotlight and that could mean that they're going to get judged and hurt. We've already talked about perfectionism. Unless I can do it perfectly, I'm not going to even attempt it. , I'll procrastinate. Another characteristic of complex trauma is often children grow up in chaos. There's just bad things happening all the time. There's drama. There's danger. There's all kinds of noise going on. Violence. Fighting. Tension. And , it's really, really hard for the child to concentrate long enough to complete a task because their brain is darting around with all of the distractions, all the chaos that's going on. And , they can't be present long enough to complete the task. Then, in the child's mind is, let's just do a bunch of mindless distractions that use up all the nervousness and all this energy I got because I can't get the job done that I need to do. And , procrastination comes out of that. Many people that grow up in that chaos, that becomes their normal.",

And , now for people, to sit down and do a task, even when they're in a place that's safe and quiet with no distractions, something now resists it because it feels boring. It feels too structured. It feels restrictive. And , they begin to go, I'm just kind of a spontaneous person. I need to do stuff when I feel it, when it's exciting to me. I don't routine and rigid structure. Another thing that can come out of complex trauma is the spoiled child. And they tend to become procrastinators in adult life because in childhood, if you put off doing something, somebody would step in and do it for you. , if you procrastinated, that's a good way to get somebody else to do it for you. Or, you were never required to do hard work. You were never required to be disciplined, to do chores and a routine. You could do only what you felt doing. You didn't have to do stuff you didn't feel doing. And then, if you didn't do stuff, there were no negative consequences. It was just, oh, somebody else will take care of the consequences for you. And , many spoiled children turn out to be procrastinators. Another thing that comes out of complex trauma is this strong internal critic, which is connected to shame, connected to the parenting that you received as a child, where you're always finding fault with stuff. And , what happens is, if you don't do the job, you get criticized. But if you put off doing the job, you get criticized. If you do the job, you get criticized. You're going to get criticized whether you procrastinate, whether you don't do it, whether you do it. There's criticism everywhere. And , for people that just have this powerful inner strength, this powerful inner critic, it's a no-win for them. They're going to get criticism everywhere. , they just go, let's distract and let's try to have pleasure and shut up the inner critic because I'm going to get criticized even if I do the job.

And , the child just procrastinated and then their parents took over and did it because they were just impatient. , if the child didn't learn how to mix the dough or put eggs in the batter, all of that properly the first time, was making too much of a mess, the parents just took over because they were impatient. Or if the child didn't do it perfectly the first time, the parents took over because they were perfectionists. Or if the parents were all about image, then they would do everything for the child in a public setting that they look good. The child didn't have to learn or try to do it. Or if the parent was codependent with the child and they just wanted their child to be happy all the time and never struggle and never go through painful emotions, the parent jumped in and did everything for the child just the child would be happy. that then results in a child later on becoming great at procrastinating. One other thing is some children that come out of complex trauma end up with ADHD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. And what we know about ADHD is that children with ADHD don't have a good concept or a sense of time. they can go, you need to get something done, you need to get something done today. And they can just play around thinking they got all kinds of time and burn up the whole day because they just don't have a good concept of time. And they're procrastinating without even realizing they're procrastinating. One of the things that usually develops as a person begins procrastinating more and more is that they then have to develop kind of mental games to feel , to feel about it, to justify it to themself. And in the beginning it might start out, oh , I got lots of time. they can make that excuse and put it off. But then they can go to, oh, I need the extra pressure of a deadline hanging over my head before I get the head space to do a job. They can develop all kinds of mental games.",

Look at what that fear was. And then look at what that memory was about. , when you look at that memory, is just ask, are there any body sensations that I'm experiencing now that might accompany that memory. Often people will feel something in their gut or their throat or their chest area. They have trouble breathing. They'll feel kind of an increase of heat in their face. Check out body sensations. What did that child need at that time to help them face that fear. Did they just need encouragement. Did they need somebody to teach them. Did they need somebody to show them how to do it. Did they need to be able to do something and fail and not get criticized. What did that child need. Then comfort that child. Assure that child. But then go, probably that's the fear I'm facing today. Get into your cortex and go, what do I need to give myself today. Maybe I need to learn some tools here that I don't have. Maybe I need encouragement from somebody else. Maybe I need support from somebody else. Figure out what do I need today. And there's no shame in that. There's no judgment in that. You are trying to give to yourself now the things that weren't given to you as a child. Now, you may initially need a mentor or a therapist to help you go through this process of understanding why procrastination was developed by your brain as a child to protect you and to help you begin to know how to help that little child, which means helping yourself today. don't be afraid to ask for a therapist or a mentor to help you with this.

Here's some of the things that help me. Break a big task down into little tasks. if I got to get this big task done, that just feels overwhelming. break it down into 50 little tasks. I could do this today, that tomorrow, that tomorrow, and over the period of a week, I'm going to get the task done. break big tasks down into little tasks. Don't be afraid to reward yourself. If I accomplish this, then I am going to reward myself with something I really. That's what we do for a child. If you do this, I'll take you out for ice cream. Rewards are. Our limbic brain still needs those along the way. And then don't necessarily just wait to the end or the completion of the project to give yourself a reward. It's to give yourself rewards along the way. Oh, I got these steps done. Let's have a reward. we need that positive encouragement of rewards. And that doesn't mean I'm weak. That doesn't mean I'm a failure. That's just how we work. And it's to do it. Some people, what they have to do is begin to learn to do the thing I least want to do first. I'm not going to put it off and do more enjoyable tasks first and then never get around to that. I need to get what I least want to do done off. Second, some people, if they're going to say, I'm going to start this job, they need a 10-minute, we call it 10-minute technique to warm up to the job where they do little activities. They do little things. They do some yoga. They listen to some music. They get themselves into a good headspace. And allow yourself, if you need it, a 10-minute, 15-minute window to kind of get yourself into the mood. Some people, they need to change their environment. I need to write this letter. I need to get this project done. I can't do it sitting in my office or sitting in my living room. I need to find a different place and change it up. And that often helps them get started.",

Some people find it helpful to just put it on the calendar. I am going to start this job at this time. Then they make themselves accountable to a friend. But having that start time on the calendar is important for them. Another thing is I have asked myself, when am I most motivated to do hard work. And that's usually for me, and it's going to be different for everybody. But it's the earlier in the day, the earlier in the morning, the better. And often it's a certain day of the week or on the weekend when I am just kind of in my prime energy place. , let's do the hardest jobs in my prime energy place. learn that about yourself. Another thing that's helpful for many people is to make to-do lists. But it's kind of two lists. What do I need to get done over the week. what are my weekly responsibilities. How much free time do I have. And then based on that I make a daily list. , here's what I got done today. Here's where I can fit in this extra job. those lists are very helpful for people. Another thing that can be helpful is do it with a friend. If you're just finding it impossible to get motivated to do it on your own, ask a friend, would you come over and just help me as I do this project. Just be with me as I do it. Just be with me as I do this project. That can often provide some great motivation. Another thing, be accountable. Tell your friend, I'm going to be doing this job today. Check in with me tomorrow just to make sure I've done it. And that just provides a little bit of extra motivation. Play the tape to the end.

    "text": "Tonight we're starting a new series. And what I want to look at is what does recovery look realistically. And over the years I've dealt with many clients who come into recovery and they have all these unrealistic expectations about what recovery is going to be. They think there's a magic bullet somewhere, they just got to find it, and then they'll be magically cured. They think it'll be easy. They think they'll just do certain steps, they'll be fixed and never struggle again, and on and on and on it goes. And part of what I do, and it's not always the fun part, but I have to try to paint a realistic picture of recovery, and it's a lot of work. I don't know much in life that requires more work than recovery and dealing with trauma, but I say that not to discourage you because I think there's a ton of hope. And there's a lot of hope. There's a lot of hope if people will do what they need to do. one of the things I want to do is come at this recovery topic from a whole bunch of different directions. that each week you'll get a little different part of recovery and hopefully understand it just a little bit better. that gradually a bit of a roadmap will come into play in your mind, and the encouragement and hope that you'll have to be able to do that. And I think that's what I'm going to do. And I'm going to do it in a way that's going to help you to begin this journey, which I think is worth the effort. tonight I want to come at it from a perspective that talks about seven levels of change that are required in recovery. And I do this because a lot of people come in and think they only got to change one thing, and then they're going to be. these levels basically are going to go in the order that I'm going to present them, but they don't necessarily have to go in that order. But you're going to find it's kind of layers of an onion. You get through one layer, then you get to the next and the next, and it just gets deeper and deeper. that each layer takes you to a more difficult part than the one before.",

    "text": "And eventually you get down to the core. we're going to start on the outside and work our way to the core. And it'll give you a great big picture of about what is involved in needing to be changed in recovery. the first one is you can't get recovery unless you have some abstinence. And that's the first goal is to be able to stay clean and sober. Now I always feel the need to add this. People who are really serious about recovery, they do have relapse. They do have relapse. That doesn't mean they go back to zero, that they didn't learn anything, that they messed up and nothing was accomplished. What my goal when a person relapses is what can we learn from it we don't repeat it. as you work towards abstinence, you might have some slips here and there. Don't see that as a total failure or the end of the world or you can't do this. See it as an opportunity to learn that you have a greater probability of getting this abstinence. you can learn some stuff, but what you're going to find is this. If you keep slipping, you're only going to grow to a certain point then stop. the abstinence does become important at some time if you want to continue the healing, growing, and recovery. you're going to start to realize that you have to change situations in your life. And what I mean by that is this. Your old life, party life, spending time with buddies at the bar, doing the things that you did with using friends, that's got to change. Most people realize they can't continue to go to bars and parties and expect to stay clean and sober. They have to change. They have to begin to develop new situations, new circumstances, new locations, new people. They got to replace the old stuff with new. And for many people that is a huge change. Because it's everything you used to do, you can't do anymore. You have to now start to replace it with new activities in new locations, with new groups of people. And that can be an overwhelming feeling type of change because it's everything is going to change. But that's only layer two. The next one we get into are behavior changes.",

I have to begin identifying the lies that I believe about myself, about happiness, about life. Because if I don't change those lies to the truth, I'm never going to make it. Then the next thing that happens with people coming out of complex trauma is you have this, if you're old enough to remember, eight track tape. you have to be really old to remember. You have to remember that. But they are continuous loops. you would get to the end of the tape and you didn't have to turn it over.

If you grew up in complex trauma where nobody had time for you, where you got abandoned, where you got criticized, where you got abused, you were made to feel that you were the problem.

Now what many people think is they're powerless to stop those tapes. I want you to understand those tapes are powerful because they have been reinforced and reinforced for years.

And Nehemiah is overwhelmed by the mess in Jerusalem, that he says, that he can't even bring himself to be happy that day. That's how overwhelmingly painful his emotions were. And some of you get that. And he comes on the job, and he's sad, and the king says, what's wrong with you. And immediately he kind of panics. Because you're not supposed to do that, and he utters a very quick, quiet and says, help. And he tells the king all about the mess in Jerusalem. And the king says, I want you to go and help. I will even pay your way to go and help. I will even provide materials to start building a wall.",

    "text": "And I will send a bit of the army to keep you safe. Because you are going to be in a war zone. And you're going to need safe keeping. I will protect you. Imagine Nehemiah sitting there going, wow. How did that just happen. Is it odd or is it. And that's what many of you have gone through. These weird coincidences. That out of the blue, something opens up. But what I about this was, Nehemiah had to sit for a little while. There wasn't an instant fix for the problem. He had to go and just wait. And we don't that. But then once he gets there, the first thing he does, and this is your step four, is I arrived in Jerusalem and three days later I slipped out during the night. That's because there's enemies everywhere. And I went all around the city inspecting the wall. And what he was doing was this. I can't begin recovery unless I know the damage. I can't begin recovery unless I know what the problems are. I can't begin recovery unless I know what needs to be done. I can't begin recovery unless I do an inventory. I can't begin recovery and expect to succeed unless I diagnose the problem correctly and diagnose the solution correctly. And that's what we're doing in this series. And that's what Nehemiah did. let me say this. One of the things said was this. Don't go into battle unless you counted how much it's going to cost you. And what he is saying is just don't go in there with this fantasy in your mind saying, I'm going to go into battle and I'm going to be a knight in shining armor. Nothing bad is going to happen to me. Everything will be fine, wonderful. It will be a lot of fun. is saying get real. Realize when you take on a task what it's going to require of you. And that's what Nehemiah is doing. He says I want to rebuild this city but I got to figure out exactly what needs fixed. How much material is needed. How much manpower is needed. How much time it's going to take. All of the obstacles. All of the things that are going to become part of making this happen. I got to get it figured it out.",

    "text": "It's not going to have the same effect every time you're working through it. Another one is similar to that is kind of the roller coaster. The child going to the roller coaster for the first time, they see the huge drop, they hear people screaming, it just looks terrifying to them. They get on it and it is terrifying, but it's also kind of exciting. And they go back and they want to do it again. Each time they go on that roller coaster, the terror part decreases, but the fun part increases. And that's the same with dealing with trauma. It's a roller coaster, terrifying at first, but as you get doing it, it becomes less and less terrifying. A third, analogy is, let's say you see blue smoke coming out of the exhaust of your car. And you go to the service station and you say, just, could you just stop the blue smoke from coming out. And your thinking is, he's going to wave some magic wand or do some little quick fix that's just going to make blue smoke stop coming out of the car. But the mechanic says, oh, sure, I can do that, but I'm going to have to over, haul your engine. And you go, whoa, whoa, no, no, no. There's got to be a quick fix just to stop the blue smoke. They go, no, this is going to require an engine overhaul. That's the same when you got blue smoke coming out in your daily life, that's starting to mess up your relationships. You need an engine overhaul. Another example that's helpful is, a lot of people look at this recovery journey and they see other people who are kind of experiencing the results of the journey at the end. And they see their, they got their families back, their kids are getting healthy, their relationships are meaningful, healthy attachment, good job. They've got joy again in their life and they go, I want that. I want that. But then they start the journey and they go, this is a lot of hard work and pain. I'm not sure it's worth it. And an illustration that sometimes can help is that of an athlete.",

And what you do with them is say, think about the amount of time, amount of hours they had to practice to become good at basketball or football. Hours or years. Think of the early mornings. Think of the discipline. Think of the days they had to do it and they didn't feel it. Think of the pain that they went through at times. Think of the focus they had to have. Think of the things they had to say no to that they couldn't allow into their life. That was a lot of hard work over a lot of years. Work that others weren't willing to put in. But they did. And as a result, they won the trophy. That's what recovery is. It's a lot of hard work for a lot of time, but it is worth it if you do it. Another one that I use sometimes with people is, again, people will say, just help me be a great husband. Help me to be a great father. give me three easy steps to be a great husband and a great father. And I go, that would be a child coming to me. Saying, I want to be the president of Disney now. Give me three easy steps I can be the president of Disney now. And I go, I could teach you a lot of stuff about administration. I could teach you a lot of stuff about managing people. Good tools, useful tools, but they wouldn't really matter unless you had years of growing internally. Unless you had years of maturing, of becoming a stronger, healthy person. And there's tools, yes, but there's internal growth. That's the biggest part of becoming effective. And that's the same with fathering. That's the same with being a partner. I'm going to teach you tools, but you have to accept the slow process of graduating. And that's the key. And that's the key to gradual maturity.

But two key things to keep in mind. the goal is connection and resiliency. The goal of this journey is trauma caused me to have to disconnect from others. Because they weren't safe. And they kept hurting me. I didn't have secure attachment. But then I disconnected from myself. Because I thought I was terrible. And I have to connect with self and learn to connect with others. That's the goal. Secondly, to heal, I need to transform the trauma. yes, it's a terrible negative. It did tons of damage. But I want to get to the point where not only do I heal. But I turn all of that painful, painful stuff into skills that make me stronger. Skills that enable me to help others in ways I couldn't help others before. that I gain strength from all of that adversity. that's the big picture goal. I just want to emphasize again. The importance of this self-awareness. It is such a foundational part of the beginning of the healing journey. And it's an ongoing part of the journey. Because we're always getting to know new levels, new layers of ourselves, of our issues. you never get to a point where you fully know all of your issues and yourself. It's just an ongoing journey. But it begins with bringing all of this subconsciousness. Bringing all of this subconscious programming to the conscious level as you become aware of it. And you become aware of it when you're triggered. And all of a sudden you respond by going, what's going on here. You're curious. And then you begin to become aware of patterns. You begin to become aware of how that affected you. Of memories, of a trauma, of a wound that happened. That's one level of self-awareness. Then what you begin to realize is, I'm starting to see that my triggers have themes. Disrespect, made to feel stupid. When I'm neglected. When I feel rejected. When I feel abandoned. When I feel lonely. All of those are my triggers. And, let's learn. , let's learn from that what's going on here. Then you begin to go to learning what healthy looks.",

I'm not going to beat myself up. I'm going to go ouch. I'm going to go ouch. I'm going to go ouch. I'm going to go ouch. And it's a trigger. It's simply your wounded child inside of you going ouch. And it is inviting you to say let that wounded child guide you to the next area where you need to heal. don't get down on yourself. Don't beat yourself up. Just go, thank you. This is helping me know where I need to go next. And what happens is their limbic brain goes back to the old limbic brain tools, which are survival tools. And they go back to old behaviors. And a lot of people feel, oh, I regressed. It's I never learned anything. No, you just went back to your old toolbox. what you can do is ground yourself, get into your cortex where your new toolbox is and start using them. And what happens in growth is. Yes, you're going to have your limbic brain triggered. You can't prevent that. There might be some regression, but you can stop it, catch it, go to your new toolbox. And the more you do that, what you're going to find is when you're triggered, you're going to regress less and less. And you're going to go to your new toolbox quicker and you're going to see growth happening. But in the initial months, you're going to find yourself going to the old toolbox. And it's going to feel regression. But just know your brain just gone back to that old familiar place. You can stop it and get to the new one. Let me just summarize them. what I hope you're seeing is that in recovery, in the early part of recovery, you're just learning tons of information, education about self-awareness, tools, what healthy looks. And you're going to grow a lot through that. And it's going to be a wonderful time. But then once you kind of got the main part of the education piece done, you're going to go on with life. And your growth at that point isn't going to come from education from courses and that. It's going to come from being triggered.",

You do the stuff, but you're not going to get instant gratification. It's not going to come until later. Now you got to sit in this no gratification. Deferred to gratification. That's new to you.

But there are pitfalls along the way that you are going to be subjected to. Now let me end with this. I get asked all the time, what modalities do you use in your therapy and your treatment programs. And modalities are just different psychiatric approaches. Different therapies that have been developed over the years to help people. What I have found is this. I don't use just one modality. I use a blend of all the modalities. That to me is important. Because what I have found is one modality, if only it is used, it provides some benefit. But it doesn't get to all of the issues. And that's why I have to borrow from all of the different modalities. Because one is usually not enough. Secondly, some modalities work really at the beginning of the journey. Others work better later in the journey. If I was to try to use some that are good for later in the journey. If I was to use them at the beginning of the journey, it could actually do damage. And I need to be aware of a bunch of different modalities. When it is best to use them in that person's life. That is such an important part in this journey. let me very, very quickly give you a summary of some of the modalities that are helpful. I talked about cognitive behavioural therapy.",

I need to meet all 12 needs. I could be lacking in 10 other areas now. And sitting all day is not going to meet those other 10 areas. And just listening to my limbic brain's solution is not always wise. All that the limbic brain is aware of is what it's feeling most intensely. It's not necessarily aware of what is happening underneath that. And I need to get to my cortex. And this is important. When I am feeling depleted, my limbic brain is triggered, and I need to pay attention to that. But then I need to get to my cortex and I need to begin to investigate without judgment, with curiosity, and ask myself some questions. What needs haven't been met lately. What's been going on in my life that maybe is causing greater stress, greater anger. What's been happening. What would help meet my needs now. What should I change. What should I do that's going to help to meet those needs. Have I been neglecting in my life any of the things that I had built into my life that were important for keeping me in a healthy place, that were meeting all of the needs. what happens to a lot of people is when they're in crisis, they go, I need to start getting up every morning and having time just to do yoga, to meditate, to just be quiet and check in with myself and be mindful. And they set up a routine and it begins to really start to bring about positive changes and really good. And then what happens is, I'm feeling good. I don't need to do that stuff anymore.

I need to be able to become aware of the more subtle emotions when they're not at that intense point. let me end by saying this, this part of self-awareness and doing that self inventory and figuring out what's going on, for many people, they need to stop for a half an hour and be really quiet and get centered and grounded and connected to their body and connected to their emotions before they can ask those questions. If I was to go to some people that are depleted and go, where's your stress level at. Oh, I haven't been stressed. Oh, where's your depression at. Oh, no, I'm not depressed. In their mind, they aren't because they haven't connected yet. They're still in a disconnected place and they're talking from a disconnected place that's not feeling those things they don't think they have those things. And get yourself to a place where you can be quiet for a period of time, away from distractions and truly connect. And as you do that, then you're able to do that inventory. this becoming quiet, what are the signs I am depleted. What depletes me. What are the signs I am depleted. I think this is such an important part for many, many people coming out of complex trauma to become aware of. And then, what do I need to do when I am depleted to get myself back on track. What do I need to do on a daily basis I don't keep sliding into getting depleted. Such important tools to learn.

You're purposely controversial in conversations to provoke a reaction. You post excessively on social media, seeming to vie for as many and comments as possible. You make comments online or in person that seem calculated to make people feel uncomfortable or cross social boundaries. Or you're always needing to give advice to people. Or you engage in provocative, promiscuous, or exhibitionist behavior. You make frequent self-deprecating comments in an effort to get validated, in an effort to get people to say, oh, no, no, that's not true of you. No, you're really wonderful. You seem to act as though everything that happens to you is a catastrophe, even when it's not. you create drama in order to get noticed. You seem to always want to be the center of attention.",

Deeper and deeper anxiety. And many people get overwhelmed by the anxiety, insecurity, stress of all of this, that they go to fight, flight, freeze.

Dangers. Be aware that it's easy when you get into recovery and now you're with a new group of people who are also in recovery. It's really easy to stop.

And then if I don't do it, I won't go through bad consequences because somebody will bail me out of the bad consequences. procrastination becomes their way of life. Others have a very strong internal critic, which basically says, doesn't matter what you do, I will find fault with it. You can't win. just put tasks off because I will just end up failing somehow, not doing it enough. And the internal critic will be overwhelming for me. Others are getting to the point of burnout. Their sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems have been out of balance for long that they are getting more and more tired, more exhausted, more overwhelmed that they just start procrastinating because they just do not have the energy. They just don't have the energy. They just do not have the energy to do tasks. And then some fall into addiction. Addiction now becomes the main focus of their life. It consumes more and more energy and time. Everything else gets pushed aside. Some fall into depression.",

Learn to meet with that child. Care for that child. Help that child learn tools to deal with life besides the tool of procrastination. We've talked about the next one already. They shut down. They shut down their internal alarms, their intuition, their gut, their conscience, their emotions. we have three alarm systems. Intuition. neuroception. We sense, get vibes when something isn't dangerous. you have a child who you put two people they don't know. They'll go to one, but they'll stay away from the other. Why. Because their vibes pick up. One is safe. One is not. Then we have our emotions. They are reporting back to us all the time. Whether something is safe or something is not. And then we have our conscience. That is telling us if we are going into unhealthy behaviors, unloving behaviors, or we're still in healthy behaviors. What happens in complex trauma. You shut down your intuition, your gut. You shut down your emotions. You shut down your conscience. Now you go into adult life with those shut down. And you walk into danger. All of the maladaptations. All of these coping things that you had to do to survive. They kept you safe. They got some of your needs met. But now 20, 30 years later, you realize you've built thousands of programs about how to cope that are actually unhealthy. But those programs are now in your subconscious brain.",

I have to end this. you communicate that to the narcissist and you say, it's done. Here's what's been happening. Here's what I've noticed. Here's the chances I've given you.

You go, oh, maybe, finally, they're going to be willing to look at their stuff. Not usually the case. Usually they want a discussion they can try to influence you. they're looking for an opening to be able to talk, to be able to plant seeds in your brain, to influence your thinking that you take them home. You give them one more chance. They will make false promises. They will twist things a little bit, trying to get you to give them one more chance to take them back. But they're still not willing to change at a deep level. all of these different games narcissists will play. Now, let me add another piece that has to be factored in here when it comes to ending a relationship with a pure narcissist as far as a partner or parents is this is not a minor little decision what color of socks do I wear today. This is a major life altering decision. This is not a decision that can be made lightly. It has to be thought through closely, carefully, methodically. And I never want to trivialize. I never want to trivialize. I never want to trivialize the importance of this decision. It's further complicated by the fact that often children are involved and you got to factor that in.

A while back, I was listening, playing the piano. I said, that's it. That's the tone you can't use. That one there. That one. That one. That. That's it. That's the tone. You just used it.

    "text": "Suddenly, they don't have the same power over you. They don't know where to go next because the fuel they rely on, your reaction is gone. Here's what happens when you stay silent. First, you create space. Space to breathe. Space to think. Space to remind yourself that you're not in their trap. That space is your power. Second, you flip the script. Pedder stood. Instead of you scrambling to answer, they're left scrambling to figure out why you're not reacting. It throws them off balance. Third, you protect your energy. Every word you waste on someone who doesn't value it, drains you. It's understood. Silence keeps that energy where it belongs with you. I want you to imagine a narcissist throwing every insult they can at you, expecting you to blow up, to cry, to argue. But instead, you sit there calm, maybe even with a little half smile stood and you give them nothing. Do how maddening that is for them. It's trying to start a fire with wet matches. It doesn't catch. And in that moment, you've already won. You're stood. Because you're not feeding the fire, you're letting it burn itself out. Silence is not passive. It's active. It's a choice. It's restraint. It's the discipline to hold your power instead of handing it over. Stood. And it's one of the most effective strategies an empath can use because empaths feel everything deeply. They want to explain. They want to heal. They want to smooth things over. But sometimes the strongest form of empathy is protecting yourself. Stood. And silence does exactly that. It protects you while disarming the very person who's trying to control you. the next time you're tempted to defend yourself to someone who's not listening, I want you to pause. I want you to breathe. You're stood. And I want you to remember that silence isn't weakness. It's strategy. It's strength disguised as stillness, the quiet confidence that says, I don't need to fight you to win. When you set a boundary, you're not being rude. Understood. You're not being cold. And you're not being selfish. You're being clear. You're drawing a line that says, this is where I end. And you begin. And when it comes to dealing with a narcissist, it's understood. Boundaries aren't just important. They're essential. Because narcissists test limits constantly. They push. They prod. They overstep.",

    "text": "Let me just say this now, going no contact with a narcissist is one of the hardest, most courageous things you'll ever do. And if you're here, it means you've either done it or you're thinking about it. But here's the kicker, just because you're done with them, mean they're done with you. In fact, the second you go silent, that's when the game begins. Because narcissists, they don't just walk away. Oh no, they plan, they plot, and they wait. They're not texting you because they respect your boundary. They're not reaching out because they've moved on. They're quiet because they're strategizing. And today, I'm pulling back the curtain. I'm going to give you the seven things a narcissist secretly wants from you when you cut them off. Not the obvious stuff, not the surface level drama. I'm talking about what's happening behind the scenes, what they're hoping you'll do, what they're waiting to see, and why silence isn't a break for them. It's a setup. if you've ever questioned your decision, if you've ever wondered, why do I still feel they're pulling strings. Stay with me. I'm going to give you the seven things a narcissist secretly wants from you when you cut them off. Because by the end of this, you're going to understand their playbook and better yet, you'll know exactly how to win. Let's go. When you go no contact with a narcissist is a reaction. Not necessarily a fight, not even a conversation, just something, a slip up, a post, a , a text, anything that shows them they're still under your skin. Because the moment you go quiet, it's mind doesn't register that as an ending. It registers it as a challenge, a test of control. And trust me, they are watching. They're monitoring everything you do, even when you think they've moved on. Why. Because your silence isn't just silence to them. It's a threat to the control they once had over you. Narcissists are not just silences to them. They're a threat to the control they once had over you. Narcissists thrive on attention. It doesn't matter if it's positive or negative. It's all fuel. When you go no contact, it's cutting off their oxygen supply. That's silence. It's powerful. But to them, it's infuriating. It's confusing. They can't stand not knowing how you feel.",

They might post something targeted, but vague, just to see if you'll bite. They might reach out to a mutual friend or comment on something from your past, hoping it finds its way back to you. All of it is bait. They want a reaction. A reaction means you're still playing the game, even if you think you're not. And here's where it gets tricky. The narcissist knows your patterns. They know what buttons to press. If they can't get you to talk, they'll settle for you feeling. If they can't pull you back in, they'll settle for occupying your thoughts. They want you checking their socials. They want you replaying the last conversation in your head. They want you angry or sad because every emotional response, even if it's internal, reinforces their power. See, the narcissist doesn't need you to reach out. They just need you to care. They just need to know that you're not at peace. That's the win for them. Because the moment you react, whether it's a message, a comment, or even a post that hints you're upset, they know you're not at peace. They know you're not at peace. They know you're not at peace. They know the door is still cracked open. And if the door's open, they can walk back in whenever they want. And let's talk about the mental chess they play during no contact. They might intentionally disappear, hoping you'll start to wonder. Why aren't they trying to reach out. Do they not care anymore. Have they really moved on that fast. That silence from them is sometimes staged. It's manipulation in disguise. Because what they're hoping for is that the silence makes you break the no contact, just uncertain enough to text first. And the second you do, game over. They're back in control. Don't just want a reaction. They expect it. They're counting on it. They believe they've left enough of a mark on you that no contact is just temporary. That you'll miss them. That you'll second guess yourself. And if they can't get you to respond directly, they'll try to provoke you indirectly. Maybe they'll spread rumors.",

    "text": "With time, you might forget the intensity of their manipulation, the exhaustion of walking on eggshells, or the emptiness you felt when you were with them. They know nostalgia is powerful. And they're counting on it to do the heavy lifting. If they sense you're getting stronger, they may try to trigger that internal confusion by subtly reappearing. A message that says, just checking in. A song they know you loved. A photo memory from the past. These aren't signs of growth or regret. They're bait. Carefully dropped. Emotionally timed. And strategically hollow. They want you to think maybe they've changed. Maybe they miss me. But really, they just want to see if you're still emotionally available. If they can still get inside. The hardest part about no contact is that you're not just walking away from the person. You're walking away from the illusion they created. The fantasy that one day, they'll finally see your worth. Finally treat you. Finally become the person they pretended to be. Narcissists know this. And they count on it. They know you want closure. You want understanding. You want to believe the connection meant something. That hope. That lingering belief. They don't chase. Because they don't think they have to. They believe you'll do it for them. Eventually. All they have to do is wait. When a narcissist loses access to you, one of the first things they try to control is the narrative. They want your reputation. Not in the sense of admiration. But in the sense of manipulation. When you go no contact, they know they can't reach you directly. they begin to work through other channels. Mutual friends. Social media. Shared communities. Any platform or person that can help them reshape how others see you. Because if they can't have you, they want to own your story. The best way to do that is by making sure people know that you're there. They'll start subtly at times casting small shadows on your character. They may say things , I don't know what happened. They just switched up on me. Or, I tried everything. They wouldn't even talk to me. These statements are calculated. They make you look irrational, cold, or unstable without ever sounding a direct attack. Because narcissists are often charming and persuasive to the outside world. People believe them. They come across as wounded, misunderstood, and abandoned.",

They want you off balance. They want your emotional state to stay tied to them, even without any direct contact. Your energy is valuable. They worked , hard to manipulate you. They want you to keep a connection to it. They want you second guessing yourself. They want you waking up with tightness in your chest. They want you to carry the residue of their presence into your new relationships, your daily life, your inner world. That lingering emotional chaos. It's intentional. They plan to do it. They plan to do it. They plan to do it. They plan to do it. They plan to do it. It's intentional. They planted it a virus, hoping it would keep running in the background even after they're gone. They also know how to activate your empathy and use it against you. You might hear they're struggling, that they're depressed, that they've changed. And a part of you, especially if you're a deeply caring person, might want to check in to make sure they're. But that's the trap. The moment you break no contact, they've plugged back into your energy source. The apology, the vulnerability, the regret, it's all part of a cycle meant to reset the connection and pull you back into their orbit. Even if you don't respond, that you're still wondering what if is enough for them because they want space in your head. They want you to replay, the relationship. To question yourself, to doubt your worth, to feel stuck, all of that creates an energy drain that benefits them, even if they never see it directly. You're leaking emotional fuel and they're soaking it up from wherever they are. They don't need to yell, text, or show up to take from you. They do it with silence, with memories, with games where they're not, you don't even know you're still playing. They'll haunt your peace, not because they miss you, but because they need something from you. And if they can't get your attention, they'll settle for your exhaustion.",

The other clippings I will read you are obituaries, all from the Globe and Mail. Obituaries are fascinating, because they tell us not only about the person who died, but also about what we as a society value in other people. And often what we value in other people is exactly what kills them in the first place. You heard the expression, the good die young. They do. And there's reasons for it. A lot of you are heaving a sigh of relief. , I don't have to worry about myself then, you're saying. But listen to these obituaries. This one is a doctor who died at age 55. And I'm talking here about people who died before their time. This guy dies at age 55 in Toronto of cancer. The obituary says, and this is written as if it was a good thing, never for a day did he contemplate giving up the work he loved at Toronto Sick Children's Hospital. He carried on with his duties toward his year-long battle with cancer, stopping only a few days before he died. Now, think about that one. If you're diagnosed with cancer, or if your friend of yours was diagnosed with cancer, would you say to him or her, hey buddy, here's what you do. Go back to work tomorrow. And all the time that you're getting chemotherapy and radiation and whatever else you're going through, just work every day until you die. this compulsive and rigid identification with duty, role and responsibility, rather than the needs of the self, is a major risk factor for illness. The next obituary is written by a husband about his wife, Naomi, who died at age 55, also of cancer. And he writes, in her entire life, she never got into a fight with anyone. The worst she could say was, phooey, or something else along those lines. She had no ego. She just blended in with the environment in an unassuming manner.

One is to repress it, this woman did. these are the people that are always nice. they're always nice. I worry about really nice people. The other way is to give in to it, and to act it out, to go into rages. That's also unhealthy. The first, the repression of anger, leads to autoimmune disease and cancer. When you're raging all the time, that increases your risk of heart disease and strokes. in the aftermath, the studies have shown, that in the aftermath of a rage episode, your risk of a heart attack doubles for the next two hours.

She just blended in with the environment, in an unassuming manner. And this is supposed to be a good thing. Now my wife's name is Ray, and she's an artist, and it's one of her books, one of her paintings, that provided the detail here, on the cover, and the color scheme for the cover for this book. And sometimes I say to Ray, we've been married 42 years, why can't you blend in with the environment, in an unassuming manner. But Ray has done her psychological work, and she's read my book, and she's also seen the studies. there was a study, just four or five years ago, presented at a major medical conference, that looked at 1700 women, over a ten year period. And over a ten year period, out of these women, those who were unhappily married, and suppressed their feelings, were four times as likely to die, as those who were also unhappily married, but expressed their feelings. the issue wasn't, happy marriage or unhappy marriage, the issue was, did the woman express herself, or did she not.",

Now, I'll read you one more of these, I'll read you a couple more of these obituaries. This is a mother in the middle of the night, in Calgary, who died in her early 50's, again, cancer. Just look at this. A master at multitasking, she juggled several hockey practices, school board, orchestra, and other extracurricular activities. June 2005 brought terrible news to this mother of three, by not president of the parents' council, at Western Canada College. Emergency surgery revealed metastatic cancer, she refused the cloak of illness, she did not give up on any of her roles. , she had all these roles, and they were more important than who she was. She even continued her 5 a. m. bicycle trips around a nearby reservoir, now imagine that, when you're getting chemotherapy. She enrolled in a life coaching course, and upon graduation from the Adler School, she initiated Living Out Loud, a group for women with cancer. It's very typical of people who get chronic disease. And finally, another physician who dies of cancer, and again, how the obituary writes something that's clearly, when we look at it, is self-destructive, but the person didn't realize it, and neither does the individual. Who writes the obituary. Sidney and his mother had an incredibly special relationship, a bond that was apparent in all aspects of their lives until her death. As a married man with young children, Sidney made a point to have dinner with his parents every day, as his wife Rosalind and their four kids waited for him at home. Sidney would walk in, greeted by yet another dinner to eat and to enjoy. Never wanted to leave, never wanted to disappoint either woman in his life, Sidney kept eating two dinners a day for years until gradual weight gain began to raise suspicions. that this poor man suffered under the belief that, number one, he was responsible, however everybody else felt, and number two, he must never disappoint anybody. he actually couldn't say to his mother, , mom, I got amazing news, I got four kids, and I'm going to have dinner with them most of the time.",

    "text": "Because in the West, when I say the West, I mean the dominant Western culture, unlike Aboriginal cultures, unlike the traditional medicines of China or India or native traditions around the world, we separate the mind from the body. we treat only the body. Unless you have mental illness, in which case we still separate the mind from the body. And the other thing we separate is the individual from the environment. As I said to you last night, those of you that were there, you can't separate people from the environment. People are shaped by the environment. And in lifelong interaction with the environment, that's how human beings live. Now let me give you three examples of that. Why you can't separate people from the environment. It's been shown now, for example, that children whose parents are stressed are much more likely to have asthma. Now, not controversial. Several studies have shown that. in polluted areas where there is more asthma, it's the kids of parents who are stressed who are most likely to have the asthma. Now, most doctors have never heard about that. And if they did, they can't explain it. And yet it's obvious, you see. Those of you that have asthma, anybody had asthma here before in your life. You were given two kinds of inhalers if you had asthma. One inhaler is probably called Ventolin, and its job is to open up the airways. Because what happens in asthma is you get a spasm of the muscles that surround the airways, you get this narrowing of the tube through which air has to pass into the lungs, you're wheezing and whistling and laboring your breathing. And the other inhaler you got would have been a steroid to suppress the inflammation, the swelling, and the inflammatory debris that clutters up the airway. you get two inhalers. One is called a bronchodilator to dilate, open up the airway. The other is to suppress the airway. And the other is to suppress the inflammation. Now, what are these inhalers based on. The inhaler that opens up the airway is a copy of adrenaline. And the inhaler that opens up, that suppresses the inflammation, is a copy of cortisol. What are adrenaline and cortisol. They're stress hormones. Exactly.",

    "text": "And your body would be in a different state physiologically in a split second in order to help you fight or escape. That's good. in the short term, the stress hormones help you fight or to escape. But. What do they do in the long term. In the long term, the stress hormones deplete your body, suppress your immune system, give you heart disease, high blood pressure, give you ulcers, thin your bones. Now, what would happen if you were stressed, something happened that was stressful to you, and you're sitting there all upset about it, and your body is in a state of imbalance and upset, but somebody that you trust came along and said, Hey friend, I see that you're not feeling. I see that you're upset. Puts a hand on your shoulder and says, Hey, do you want to talk about it. And what would happen to your body away. Yes, it would relax. You take a deep breath. Your brain would get oxygen. You start thinking more clearly. Your heart rate would slow down. Your blood pressure diminish. The stress hormones abate in your system. And you go back into a healthy balance. All because somebody said, Hey buddy, do you want to talk about it. You're not going to talk about it. Those women that had been stressed, but were emotionally alone, the stress hormone acted on their system for months. That's why they were more likely to get cancer. It's really straightforward. In other words, again, the physiology of one individual can't be separated from the psychological and social environment. And finally, at the end of life, a study in a major medical journal a few years ago showed that amongst elderly couples, when one of them is hospitalized, what do you suppose happens to the other one. They get sick. In other words, the risk of illness goes up in the other one when the one is hospitalized. Why. Because their immune systems are not isolated from our psychological, emotional, social relationships. You can't separate the mind from the body. And you can't separate the individual from the body. You can't separate the mind from the environment. how this works, I'll tell you in a few minutes, but I'll just illustrate it with a disease I'm quite interested in. Because, again, medical science says we don't know the cause of it.",

    "text": "Taking care of her, not wanting her to worry,. But here's the thing about my mother. She was 78. She had survived the Second World War. She had survived the Nazi genocide, the death of her parents in Auschwitz. She survived communist dictatorship, the Hungarian Revolution in 1956, emigration to Canada with two adolescent boys and my father, the birth of a child in Canada when she was 39 in a new country. The whole immigration experience. Do you think she could have handled the fact, and she was a mentally and emotionally very strong person, do you think she could have handled the fact that her middle-aged son had a bit of a limp the afternoon of the arthroscopic surgery. Had I thought about it, I would not have suppressed my limp, but the point is I didn't think about it. It went back to my very first year of life, when, I was two months old when the German army marched into Budapest, and my mother phones the pediatrician to say, would you please come and see Gabor, because he's crying all the time, the day after the invasion. And the pediatrician says, of course I will come, but I should tell you all my Jewish babies are crying. Now what do you think that was about. What did I as a two-month-old know about Nazis or Hitler or genocide. What was I reacting to. The stress of my mother. Infants pick up on the stress of their mothers. And the infant learns very quickly that if the mother is stressed already, that if I add more stress to it, that might threaten my relationship with her, because she'll be even more unhappy. Then the infant will learn to suppress their own pain, simply to maintain their relationship. Now that's not a mother's desire ever to give that message to an infant, but we do automatically and unconsciously. That's just how it works. And that becomes the memory, and I'll talk to you, Gabor, about those memories later, but it becomes a memory without recall. I don't recall that time in my life, but the memory is in my body. And my friend Servas, who works with bodies a lot, he sees the body memories in the way people stand, or they hold themselves, or the way they walk.",

I think that would be I don't know a little bit of anger and a little bit of Exactly. Anger. And that's a healthy anger. Now healthy anger is nothing but a defense of your boundaries. And basically Lorraine what you'd be saying to me is you're in my space, get out. You're in my space, get out. Now if you said that in the first place you would need to be pushing me. But the pushing itself it's good. It's a good response. It's a healthy response. in other words healthy anger is an expression of a boundary defense.",

She sought and received advice from sundry sources. Her dilemma she writes in her autobiography suddenly I began to wonder how to please many people. Do I take magnesium citrate.

It is important to realize that you have to take care of yourself because you can't take care of anybody else until you do. , as trouble as you can, but if you don't take care of yourself in the process, you're going to make yourself ill. the issue, of course, is not that we shouldn't provide care to other people.
