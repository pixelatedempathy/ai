Anyways, crossing my fingers. , back of a napkin. , we're probably about one in 20 people ballpark. That's our current best guesstimate. Have more of a fearful style. My personal bet is that number remains a little low, actually, for a whole bunch of different complicated reasons. Really. Because when I was a kid, as a word, grad school, it was considered one in a hundred. one percent, one in a thousand. , my guess for that is that the way that we find these numbers in part is based on very early childhood experiences. And working and looking at kids, who are quite young. ,. , let's say that you start relatively securely attached in life. Or let's say you're insecure, but you're anxious, you're avoidant. You wouldn't be classified as having a fearful attachment style. You go through life. You end up in a relationship when you're 22 years old. Turns out that relationship is a very unhealthy relationship. It is disorganized in its character. There is an inconsistency in the way that you're engaging with that person that you're with that could go all the way up to abuse. You feel you're constantly being ping-ponged back and forth. Maybe you're breaking up and getting back together and breaking up and getting back together. You could imagine somebody who's going through that kind of an experience. What's the lasting impact of that going forward in that person's relationships. I think that we're just kind of kidding ourselves if we say, oh, that person remains securely attached or they remain anxiously attached. No, that person had an experience. And I don't know if we're capturing that when we say, oh, we looked at a group of a bunch of eight-year-olds and this is our guess about the distribution of attachment styles. It's interesting what you're getting at. We tend to think about attachment styles being developed zero to three. And static. , totally. And I just don't know if that's the case. Evolving some layers, definitely with opportunities for healing, but really quite layered in."

What's the difference between shame and guilt. Very important question. Guilt is about what you do. Shame is about who you are. Guilt is about actions. Shame is about identity. Guilt is actually a wonderful system. Where we have this thing called a conscience. That if we do something that violates love. We feel pain. if we tell a lie. If we cheat somebody. Cheat on somebody. Steal. Something bugs us. That's guilt. It was designed to be a good system. That was to say. Are you in enough pain yet. To straighten up and change your behavior. To get back to telling the truth. To being honest. guilt is a wonderful system. To correct unloving behavior. And make it loving again. guilt is resolvable. Shame is not resolvable. It is saying you're not good enough. And there's nothing you can do about it. You just have to live with that identity. And the emotions you feel around that identity. shame is the problem area. Because you can't find a way to fix it. Now I got to add false guilt. Because in complex trauma families. Your conscience was often misguided. Or miseducated. dad was saying. You're selfish for wanting to play baseball. And you go. It's wrong to play baseball. Bad me. That's a misguided conscience. But now you feel guilt. Every time you want something. And part of recovery. Is learning true guilt from false guilt. Final thing. Once you have a lot of shame. And then you do something wrong. You get guilt. But what does guilt do now. I did something bad. I am bad. guilt now feeds shame. if you got lots of shame. I don't feel good enough. I'm bad. I'm not lovable. You steal from somebody. You feel guilt. But then you go. Oh that just proves how bad I am. those feed each other. And I'm checkingallows that. Come on. Who is expensive. Humane things."

And they, they're not strong enough to resist the trigger to regulate themselves. And that's the real tricky part for people is how do you heal yourself when you're in a relationship. Do you need to take a break for a little while. Do you need to set some boundaries that enables you to not deal with certain things, talk about certain things, just work on your own stuff. you have to figure out a way. And that's where most people really struggle. And it's a very practical, practical consideration that I don't want to minimize, but it, it, it is important to sort that out.

Whether it's a boss, a co-worker, someone you've just met, or someone you've cared about for years. When you're dealing with a narcissist, the goal is to spot them early and repel them fast. That one move can save you years of stress, manipulation, and emotional abuse. If you're empathetic, giving, and care deeply about people, this test is crucial because you're exactly the kind of person they're looking for. I've spent the last 20 years researching the connection between self-worth and narcissistic relationships. As a coach, author, and someone who's lived it, I know how much damage they can do. In this video, I'll share a simple behavioral test you can use anytime, anywhere, plus real-life examples and strategies to protect yourself in any situation. let's start with what drives their behavior. Narcissists don't show up with a warning label. They show up with charm, or confidence, or with a crisis that pulls you in. Imagine you're at a dinner party, a work event, or a family function. You might be looking for connection, hoping to feel seen, or safe, or included. You might feel a little unsure of yourself or drawn to the person who seems easygoing and magnetic. Now, flip the lens. The narcissist isn't looking for any of that. They're on the hunt. They walk into that same room, scanning the crowd with one thing on their mind. Who will give me what I want, and how quickly can I get it. What they want is to be seen. They are cider-maker- But man, are youê³ sy are you se dis society are you every person is a potential source. They're not resting, they're not connecting, they're watching for openings, small signs that you'll hand over your time, your attention, or your energy. And they'll find out fast by pressing on one of three specific boundaries, because to them, these aren't yours. They're resources and you're just the delivery system. For our purposes here, let's think of boundaries in a super, super simple way. A boundary is something that you can draw a line around, something that you own, a fence around your yard. Inside the fence is yours, and outside the fence is not yours."

It is one of the heaviest weeks for clients as they begin to realize how much shame they have. Because for them, it's something that's always operated at a subconscious level. And it's impacted them. They just haven't been aware of it. And as they become aware of it, it just really gets heavy for them. And what I hear starting on Tuesday is, when are you going to tell us how to heal from shame. When are you going to tell us how to heal from shame. And I said, not until you sit in it for a while and let me diagnose it and really convince you as to how screwed up you are. And that you understand just how big this issue is. tonight I want to come to the healing from shame. And we're only going to do one part tonight. And then next Friday we're going to do the rest of the healing from shame. And I hope it is a very helpful thing for you. And what, again, we've said in all of the talks, in my mind it is the greatest negative consequence of complex trauma. And it has the greatest. greatest negative impact on a person's life. Because what shame is, is a core belief about yourself. And it's a core belief that is negative. It is a core belief that says, I don't think I'm good enough. I think the reason I was rejected, abandoned, abused, neglected, is because I must have something wrong with me that makes me unlovable and I don't have any value. And that core belief begins to morph in all kinds of different. directions and affects all your adult relationships, your coping, the messages that go on in your head. And it's all negative. And what do we do to begin to heal. what I want to do is, what I do with the clients, is the first step of healing is to begin to understand what happens or has been happening at a subconscious level in your. life. what I do is I put a diagram on the board and I say, your shame can be triggered in hundreds of different ways."

His brothers were in that famine up in Israel and they came down and Joseph saw them and then they moved down and he gave them a place in the delta for their sheep and it was a fertile place and it let them live kind of isolated and they were living in a place that was isolated from Egyptian culture that Israel was able to grow without being infected by a lot of the bad stuff of Egyptian culture. And over the next years they grew to be a nation of three million people. the Pharaoh that was part of Joseph and then after Joseph they died and a new Pharaoh came along who didn't know who Joseph was. All he knew is that they had three million people who were a threat because they weren't Egyptian they were a foreign people living in his land. And he felt threatened by them he decided to instigate a genocide and every baby boy born to a Jewish mom was to be killed. And he was going to wipe out the Jewish people by wiping out all the baby boys. And there was this one couple and they got pregnant. They were the Jewish slaves working as slaves didn't have birth control got pregnant and you can imagine the panic. Because the law is any baby boy born will be killed and they are freaking out. And somehow they're very close to and they have this sense that has allowed them to become pregnant because that baby in her womb is special. has a special plan for that baby. they instead of thinking how can we get rid of this baby it never comes to being born they go how can we protect this baby once it's born.

It's a phenomenal resource. Could you talk a little bit about your research connecting Darvo and narcissism because I can see them as being inherently connected. We knew from prior research. It has been published that there are certain things that relate to the probability that you get Darvoed. gender is one of them. women appear to be more likely to receive a Darvo response. What we were curious about was who does the Darvoing and can we figure out who's more likely to Darvo. we included some personality scales. One of them was the dark triad scale used to measure. humor. We were able to measure three constellations of sort of personality traits. One is psychopathy.

But I would think from my experience and what I do that for most shame-based people it deeply affects their relationship with. number one would be why would love me. I'm done. I'm unlovable. I don't really believe though I believe it academically that He loves me. I don't let myself feel that He loves me. That's part one. Part two, sadly for many churches that don't understand shame and the effect of shame they provide ways for people to wear masks and hopefully get love and respect from. you can hide the real you just come and serve and keep these rules and do these things then will love you. They don't feel that loved them if they didn't do those things but only if they do those things. the question that I have thought about for years and I think needs a clear answer to shame-based people is it's important to get to the point where you see that loves you as you are. You do not have to perform or do anything. what I wanted to do in the part in this shame series is give you stories that illustrate that. tonight I'm going to tell you a story from the life of King David and we've told a number of stories from him, his life but it's going to be about a guy named Mephibosheth. Now I don't know who would call their kid that but that was his name. I even thought of how could I abbreviate that. I call him Phib. No, that doesn't work. Meph. No, that's too much meth. Bosh. No, that doesn't work. we got Mephibosheth. just to give you the context, David's been king for 20 years and he's established as king. During that 20 years of his reign, the nation of Israel has grown eight or conquered eight nations and grown six times its normal size. it's expanded. And it has just prospered. And he has become basically the richest king in the world and he's got all this territory, etc. it's a time of great popularity, a time of great wealth and prestige. David is at the top of his game, at the pinnacle of his life. the question that people have would go this."

But if this has been a lot of ickiness and then the promotion thing happens and then that's not a big deal, it's definitely, if this is consistent with other patterns, that could be in the narcissistic. , remember, narcissistic people are super competitive in relationships and they're very insecure. if you're coming up and something's happening for your promotion, more money, a title, different kinds of people you're going to be interacting with, believe it or not, for all of their bluff and bravado, narcissistic people are not only really insecure, they're really afraid of abandonment. , they're scared to death of hearing that. Your success scares them. Of other viewpoints, of community. That's why I think community is important. During this time in midlife. important. I didn't understand what it was until I got into this phase of life, actually. I understood it, but not really. And I didn't feel it. Anytime I brought up something that upset me, he'd say, is it menopause again. And then laugh it off it was a joke. Again, it's definitely veering into narcissism territory if it happens repeatedly. If it's everything else in the relationship is warm and then this is sort of a kind of an edgy ribbing, I think it's still jerk, but it really comes down to what the other stuff happening in the relationship is. But if these kinds of digs. It could be anything. It could be weight gain. It could be menopause. It could be any of those things. And that's consistently used. And I said, I'd lean more into the narcissism thing. I got to have you back here. We're going to put this out. We could do this the whole time. And then we could just do this all the time.

I want expressions. And when someone is speaking, you're looking at them in the same way that the other side would do. But you have to plan. Now, the other thing I find with negotiators, one thing I did in the FBI is I always planned my interviews in exquisite detail. Who would enter the room first. Who would say what. Where I would sit. Who gets offered water and when. Because I need to be in control. Who's going to say what. These are things people don't think about.

And I started going back in my mind to this book in the that's around the middle of the called Nehemiah. It's not one that gets read very often because there's lots parts of it that are super boring, really boring. But, a while back, I was thinking about Nehemiah's story that is told and I thought, this is the perfect parallel to recovery. what I'm going to do over the next few weeks is tell you about Nehemiah and kind of how his story parallels recovery. And I hope you're going to find it very instructive but encouraging as. And just give you insight into your own troubles, your own struggles. Nehemiah lived 2,500 years ago and he lived around Jerusalem and his hometown was the city of Jerusalem in Israel. But he wasn't living there at the beginning of the story. He had been taken, captivity, and what had happened is the nation that conquered Israel had demolished the city. And Nehemiah is the guy that came along, and started to rebuild the city and he started by rebuilding the walls. What the parallel is, is that if you look at recovery, it's much what Nehemiah looked at. He looked at a whole bunch of rubble. Your life has come to rubble. Everything has crumbled and fallen apart. And a lot of people at the beginning of recovery stand and look at all of the rubble of their life, and they go, where do I begin. This is a big, big job. your relationships lie in ruin, your job lies in ruin, your finances are in ruin, your health is in ruin. Just about everything is in ruin. And recovery is all about rebuilding. But you're rebuilding from a pile of rubble. And that's what we're going to be looking at with Nehemiah because it gives us a very detailed, involved explanation of the problems that he encountered. And every problem that he encountered, we will encounter in recovery. He's going to go through days where he gets external opposition. He's going to go through days where his closest friends start to complain and become negative about him. He's going through days where he's very discouraged, days where he's struggling, days where he's stressed, days where he's tired and overwhelmed."

and f up those bad people over there at any cost and this is where trauma comes from this is where it comes from people blind with anger blind with acting out on their own internalized trauma hate is not the answer and acting out is not the answer either if you want to heal i'd recommend you be very careful not to tear other people down don't jump into bitter feuds with people who online you don't want to be a victim of a trauma you don't want to be a victim of a trauma if you feel the need to tell other people about the bad things someone else has done someone or a stranger double check your facts before you do it check your motives don't personally do anything that you feel that you have to lie about don't be stubborn when what's needed is an apology or a kind word or letting go of whatever you were holding against somebody else stand up for those who aren't able to stand up for themselves people who are not in the room when somebody else is trapped in a situation where they're not able to stand up for themselves that's a big online attack and don't use hostility where what you really need are boundaries healing is the answer when you heal your trauma you heal yourself you heal all your future relationships you heal your possibilities you heal your destiny and you brighten your light when you do this you're light do what i mean by light that's the energy and love that you bring into the world with the little things that you do maybe the big things you do too your light ripples out to affect all men and women everywhere all who have ever lived really and all who will live your light is the most real thing about you it has not given up on you it is yours to nurture yours to bask in yours to develop yours to share and this is how good wins you make it a priority a sacred thing and you make it a priority and you make it a priority to heal your trauma wounds you may not know how to do that yet and that's why it's good you're here with all of us the people in the comment section me my team the people in my courses and my membership all the little lights here are shining together and we help each other we lift each other up when one person starts to go down starts to turn negative we pull them back in we revere the good and we heal ourselves that we can give a hand to the next people we meet who need that good wins in the end but it needs us to try for it we have to aim for it people ask me sometimes your daily practice techniques are nice and everything but how long is it going to take me to heal or i don't see why i have to keep working on myself when no one else has to and you're no one has to many people don't but everyone can and i hope you will because there's nothing more important than overcoming and undoing the evil that was done to you and sometimes i see healing grass we're blades of grass that and it's as if we got stuck for a whole season under a black tarp and the grass didn't die but it can't grow and it seems dead bad grass it's all yellow and stringy under there and there's little pill bugs and worms and then one day you lift up the tarp you have the power to do that when you're healing and the sun shines on the grass the sun can't not shine on the grass it's natural and you can't do that you can't do that you can't do that you can't do that you can't do that you can't do that you can't do that and the grass is natural and the rain falls on it and in not very much time the grass begins to come back and it becomes what it was always meant to be it's grass it's green it's strong it's abundant that's what it's meant to be you are that you're designed to heal just the grass you just need water and sun and what is that you can think of water as the tools that you use to name and release the bad thing to become free of it the bad kind of grief and loneliness that grind you down and drive you towards the worst things you've ever done loneliness does that my tools personally are the daily practice techniques that i teach a lot of you do those techniques with me and if you haven't tried them and you need some tools they're lovely for washing away the fearful and resentful thoughts that trauma generates and that can drive you when you haven't healed yet the links are always down in the description section the sunshine you can think of as the loving atmosphere that supports your healing the warmth with a little luck you're going to meet people who are walking this path with you and that's what we've cultivated here on this channel and then the programs i offer which you can always find in the description section if you want to check them out for yourself you need water and sunshine tools and support you may have thought that nothing good would ever happen again but with tools and loving support you can't help but start standing in this top corner is where this lifengs yourcountry is where this workshop Radio is where this passion can be found it is where it can be following the advice received to be the feet of the Dazu or in the words ofingly affiliate heatson or the Built by Cliff in, I'm scared where this is going, but you might start to find as you feel safer because you have less fear and resentment that you can just sort of without knowing exactly where you're going, you can start yielding to the current of the good and let it begin to change your life in a positive direction."

Now that trauma plays itself out for decades afterwards. it's not what happened to me as such. Because when you look at it objectively, what happened to me as such was that my mother gave me to a stranger, and the stranger took me. Those are both huge acts of love, actually. That's the universe loving this child to take care of it. But that doesn't matter. It's what I make it mean. the wound is then what happens within us. That gets embedded in the nervous system as emotional memory, not as recollection. I don't recall being given to a stranger by my mother, because the parts of the brain that recall aren't even online at that age yet. It doesn't come online until years later. But the emotional memory of being hurt and being abandoned and not being wanted, that's embedded in the nervous system. And then it gets triggered whenever anything even vaguely resembling it later on, decades later, shows up. In fact, if you look at the expression being triggered, it's a really interesting expression. These days, we're, , trigger warning,. Don't you trigger me. , here's the thing. What can be triggered. For a trigger to do anything, a trigger is a very small little thing. For a trigger to have any impact whatsoever, there has to be an ammunition there. There has to be explosive charge. when I get triggered, it's not because somebody did something. It's because what they did happened to set off the explosion. And that explosive charge, the emotional baggage that I'm carrying. if I carry the emotional baggage of somebody who doesn't have a sense of being wanted and being important, anything later on that reminds me of that will trigger me and drive my behavior. that's how trauma works. It's embedded in the nervous system, in the brain, in the form of emotional subverbal memory. Nothing you. By the way, I'm sorry to say, one more thing. It's also embedded in the body."

        "value": "last week we started a new series on relationships and I told you the reason I was doing it is because over my last 15 years and addictions counseling what I've seen is relationships have led to more relapses probably than anything and part of the problem is that people coming into recovery have lots of needs that weren't ever met in a healthy way and loneliness and a desire to be loved is one of those big needs what they don't really realize is that they get attracted still to very unhealthy people and before they know it they're in a bad relationship and it leads to a relapse and then for people who really want to grow and get healthy they begin to realize that they don't have very good tools to help them get through that and that's why I'm talking about the tools when it comes to a healthy relationship part of recovery is really learning about relationships what healthy relationships are what are tools for dealing with conflict getting to know people etc last week I just laid out a very foundational thing on the four different levels of relationship and the five different levels of communication and intimacy tonight I want to just take that a little bit and share it with you guys and I'm going to break it down a little bit further and what I want you to understand is when you come out of complex trauma you develop ways of relating to survive and those kept you safe the ways you learn to relate but what you find is as you get older they don't work anymore but it's important to go back and really understand your relationship style and what it means for you that is a why you relate the way you relate. And that is what I want to do tonight. And for most people, what the research has shown is when children grow up in complex trauma, it's very consistent that they will adopt a certain pattern. Now, there's different patterns. Different people choose different patterns. But I want to start laying some of that out. But just to give you a wee bit of background, when we talk about complex trauma, one of the terms that I use regularly is a dysfunctional family."

It interferes with making realistic decisions in real time, important decisions about their future, about how to resolve situations. it's a way of avoiding. And it has been classified as not just kind of flight or avoidance. In some cases, it's denial of the problem. In some cases, it's dissociation from yourself, from the pain, from your circumstances. it has some very scary type of tendencies. But bottom line, it's unhealthy. It's unhealthy. It's unhealthy. It's unhealthy. It's unhealthy. If it results in me not dealing with life on life's terms, by avoiding life. The other fact about it is it's relying on emotions, not facts, to make decisions. this makes me feel good, I will pursue that. I would choose that. Instead of looking at the facts, I will just chase the feeling. why do people escape into this fantasy world. I think for the vast majority of people who do , complex trauma is at the core of it. It's really what it's all about. And you need to understand the complex trauma piece to really appreciate this style of coping. And the issue in complex trauma. The issue in complex trauma is a child is in circumstances that aren't fair, that are painful, that aren't safe. And they're trying to fix them, but mom and dad aren't allowing that to happen. Or the teacher at school isn't allowing that to happen. there's no way for them to solve their own problems. It doesn't matter what they try. It doesn't improve their situation. They remain in ongoing pain. And the brain is looking for ways to escape that problem-filled life. Since nothing healthy is working. And one of the things that the brain comes up with for some people is escaping into a fantasy world. it's all about a child's inability to resolve the difficult circumstances. And to solve them. And the painful emotions of their life. if you take that and then look at what this fantasy world looks for that child. It's a world where they feel safe. And happy all the time."

Why does Switzerland get better conditions than any other partner in the F-35 program. Without wanting to disrespect Switzerland, but who is more important to the United States as a strategic ally. Australia. Japan. Israel. Or Switzerland. Today, Viola Amert and her project manager, Darko Savic, have resigned. It is impossible to have their point of view. It should be noted that the former head of the F-35 program, the former head of the DDPS, was under intense pressure, and not only because of the choice of the F-35. A month before his resignation, in mid-December, she received a alarming letter. It was signed by the Parliamentary Finance Delegation, in charge of the financial surveillance of the great projects of the Confederation. It concerns 20 key projects of the DDPS, including the Israeli drones, but also other priority projects, such as the new radar system. Recent reports on key projects of the DDPS have allowed the Finance Delegation to notice with great concern that the state of these projects has deteriorated. These 20 projects represent 19 billion francs. In comparison, it is more than three times the price of the F-35s. we are not counting peanuts. What a shame for the President of the Finance Delegation, the UDC's National Councilor, Lars Guglisberg. It is about effectively using the money of the contributors. The relationship between expenses and benefits must be favorable. We must use the money of the contributors with care, and it is our role to supervise this. The delegation targets in particular projects linked to the digital transformation of the army. The project is a project that is in the process of being completed. We were very concerned because all these projects have deteriorated. In other words, the risks have increased. There are several reasons for this. There were internal reasons, that is, internal governance did not work. There were also tensions between the different actors. The complexity of the projects was poorly evaluated. And then, of course, there were external factors. For example, delivery problems, quality defects, especially due to the geopolitical situation. This led to delays afterwards. And that is why we decided to write this letter. , basically, there is a bit of everything that has deteriorated."

We've been going through a series on life traps or prisons that come out of complex trauma and it's really looking at the things that children had to do to survive. the behavior patterns, the thinking patterns, the emotion patterns that developed because of their trauma in childhood that they successfully used to survive all of that and even to look they were doing really. But now in adult life those very patterns are causing them to have all kinds of problems. They're preventing healthy relationships, they're hurting their children, they're messing up jobs and starting to take their toll on them personally. But when people go to change those all of a sudden they find there's something in them that doesn't want to change them. There's something in them that gravitates back and forth between them and their children. And they're trying to back to those as a default setting as a place that feels very normal and almost safe to them. And it's a huge challenge for people in recovery from complex trauma to realize that many of the things that they did to survive now have become prisons and they're really challenging to begin to change. And we've been identifying some of the major life traps or prisons that people have when they come out of complex trauma. And today I want to look at one that is prevalent, common, and it's people pleasing. And part of what makes it difficult for people is they got tons of validation for it. It wasn't just that it helped them succeed and survive, it got them tons of validation. somebody has said this about this life trap. This is the person who to a large degree experiences the world in terms of their life. And they're not just the person who's going to die, they're going to experience the world in terms of their life. And they're going to experience the world in terms of control issues. Other people in their life always seem to be in control. They feel controlled by the people around them. At the core is the conviction that they must please others, that they must please parents, brothers, sisters, friends, teachers, lovers, spouses, bosses, co-workers, children, and even strangers."

One of the biggest mistakes therapists have started making is they sit there and because a lot of them are earning a lot less money. And they don't have a secretarial pool they used to. They now type their observations as they're talking to their client. I think that's a big mistake. And from my, the studies that my company did in surveying, not the therapist, but their clients, the ones that were willing to talk, it's terrible. What I tried to emphasize is. Have material in front of you. And if there's a particular note, write a little something or if you have somebody with you that's going to be the note taker. I don't want to miss anything. If you're writing, you're not observing and observing is actually more important than writing. Now, if you started talking and mentioned that if you had mentioned the super sternal notch, I might have. Is that super or supra sternal notch. That's a worthy note.

Don't expect, , why do we have depressed students. Why do we. There's any number of things. But I can tell you this. We evolved to hug, to touch, to greet each other, , your best mate, all that stuff. When we used to wrestle with our buddies,. That play, that play wrestling. All that is.

Then how do you deal with that. What I can tell you is that the arc of the trajectory does not favor you, that these individuals are caustic, they're toxic, that eventually they will victimize you. Physically, mentally, emotionally, physiologically, or financially, you'll be victimized. The question then is, and I tell this to a lot of executives who work for these individuals who they're bullied and this stuff is, how long are you willing to tolerate it. If you can set a number and say six months or a year,. But then do something, because you will pay a price. There's a great book called The Body Keeps the Score. The Body Will Definitely Keeps the Score. You will pay a price for being in the proximity of a toxic individual. And if you become that person's chew toy, you will suffer immensely. And I say, , there's no pill to cure them. There is nothing you can do to make them you. Expect no loyalty. Try to get out as soon as you can.

They see themselves as perfect. They don't see any imperfection in themselves. And because they're flawed of character, you cannot expect normal behaviors from them. And why expose yourself to them. They will be that all their lives. There's a particular chapter where you say, one is bad, two is terrible, three is lethal.

It doesn't mean you're going to have millions of dollars in the bank, but you'll hopefully be peaceful and harmonious around the money you have or don't have because you've cultivated that within you. And that takes healing, forgiveness, letting go of self-criticism. But what you used to do now that we have awareness, we can make different decisions. And when we feel abundant versus scarce, we can live the most powerful habit within the seven habits in the book, which is the mindset habit, which is to be generous and grateful and continue all the time. you said, if money walked in the door, you'd be grateful. You say, thank you for being here. And most people say. I give when I have money, but we need to flip that on its head and say, this is the first habit that I need to have to create a rich and abundant life is to be grateful and give generously. Even if you don't have money, you can think about ways you can give of your time, of your energy, of your love, of your curiosity, of your presence, of your connection, of your connecting people together for them to flourish."

And if you were to go to the average program for being offered to people with trauma, what you would probably get is a program that focused on the physical results of trauma. they would talk about if you become emotionally dysregulated, the startled response, the hypervigilance. And all of those are debilitating things to have to deal with in adult life. They can really mess stuff up. But I would say that's not the most negative consequence of trauma. It's not in the physical stuff. It is in shame. It is in how it shapes our identity. I want to start with what I would consider to be the greatest negative consequence that comes out of trauma. And that is it creates a negative identity. I find it very interesting. We've had other programs, other agencies that have checked out our program, our material, and have basically said to me, we teach basically most of what you teach, all except for the shame piece. And I always think, wow. You've missed the greatest negative consequence. The most far-reaching consequence of trauma. Now, this shame word is a really tricky word because it's a word that's not clearly understood. It's not a word that we talk about much in our culture. It is a word that most people don't understand. And most people, when they hear shame, they think, oh, I don't have shame. When actually, it's a very clear word. When actually, they are probably controlled by shame. They have tons of shame. It is just buried deep or not even recognized because it's not been taught or understood. But it is running their life powerfully in a negative way. And that is why I really want to take tonight to develop and help you understand what is shame. that you get a very clear, picture of it. And then you can begin to understand if you have it in your own life and how it's impacting you. Where most people begin when they think of shame is really the wrong start starting point. They think of shame as an emotion. they go, I feel ashamed. that's what shame is, which is I feel embarrassed or shame on you. That emotion part of shame. let's start with it. Shame, yes, is an emotion."

And they're in their sympathetic nervous system. what is happening to them. They're not able to secure emotional attachment. and complex trauma is the very three things necessary to learn the most satisfying form of sex. They're not in an environment where any of those three things are going to happen. what then happens to that child. They get into their puberty years, they experience sex, but it's purely physical. They're in their sympathetic nervous system. They don't feel safe. They're not connecting. They're not transitioning, but they get their puberty years. the physical sensation. And to their brain, that's all they've known. That's all they've experienced. they think, this is sex. what do they focus on. I will become a professional in learning how to have the greatest physical genital sex in the world. I will learn every technique. I will study the physical organ and the physical act that I get the greatest sex in the world. That's where their thinking goes. They do not, they have not been exposed to attachment-based sex, to understanding the psychological, emotional components of truly satisfying, meaningful sex. And they sadly, and this at times just breaks my heart, but they do not, they do not, they do not, they do not, they do not, they do not, they are pursuing enhancing the physical aspects of sex, but are totally missing out on understanding the emotional attachment basis of sex. And they will not experience truly, truly satisfying sex. And that happens for many. Now, let me just very quickly cover, to summarize, what are some of the areas then that are affected by a child's sexuality. And we started with this, and I just want to highlight a couple things. number one, a child's sexuality has a profound effect on the shaping of a child's identity. nothing intensifies the feelings of vulnerability in a child sexual stuff. how a person responds to a child in those key developmental stages, has a profound effect on their identity."

Your growth makes their stagnation obvious. Their ability to maintain dignity, self-respect, and emotional control reveals the depth of their dysfunction. And they hate it. Because now instead of using you as a shiny object to validate themselves, they start seeing themselves through your eyes. And it's ugly. What they once admired in you turns into resentment. Your independence makes them feel powerless. Your peace unsettles them. Your clarity exposes their confusion. And rather than face that truth and grow, they turn against the mirror. They start to feel exposed. Not because you're trying to expose them, but because your mere existence contradicts the lies they tell themselves. You don't have to say a word. You don't have to confront them, accuse them, or call them out. Just being without them, just smiling without their approval, just moving on without giving them a second thought. It's enough to make them spiral. They can't stand seeing you thrive because it invalidates their entire story about who's in control, who's superior, and who's to blame. This is why narcissists often turn hostile after you walk away. Because you've shattered the mirror they wanted. You're no longer reflecting back a version of themselves they can admire. Now, all they see is failure. All they feel is rejection. And not the kind that happens between two adults who drift apart. This feels abandonment to them on a core psychological level. It hits the wound they've been protecting since childhood. That deep buried belief that they are unlovable unless they are in control. And your strength confirms it. instead of facing it, they lash out. They project. They accuse you of being cold, selfish, disloyal. Not because it's true, but because it helps them avoid the truth about themselves. They may accuse you of doing the very things they did to you. They'll twist your words, question your integrity, smear your name. Not because they don't see your worth, but because they do. And that worth threatens them. It reminds them of their own emotional bankruptcy."

Dude, it's funny you say that. When I did, I did a lot of cases. I would always ask.

And it would be a memo of what they did that day, or tell me what about blah, blah, blah, blah. And I would read those statements and I would know often who was my suspect, who wasn't. I had one case where baby was a few months old. Baby had a broken arm and it was between the dad and the nanny that police were looking at. And police weren't sure which one it was. We think it's either the nanny or their dad. Now in a criminal case, you always want to talk to them. The most likely suspect."

Shame is basically a fear emotion. It's basically I'm not good enough. Anybody that gets to know the real me will reject me. every time now I'm in a relationship. I feel fear.

That leads to more pain because I get judged and criticized and condemned and shunned. I'm constantly needing to be perfect. I'm constantly needing to make everybody happy. And I set unrealistic standards for myself. That just creates more fear because I can't be perfect. I can't meet those standards. Another thing that comes out of complex trauma is I put my value in the wrong things. I don't believe I have inherited. I don't believe I have a current value. That I'm not valuable just the way I am."

The priest picked out a goat and the goat was to carry the sins of the herd, of the family, and then it was sent off into the wilderness. And the family was forgiven of their sins, but the goat was gone carrying all the responsibility. If there was someone in the family who had killed someone, the goat was the murderer. If there was someone in the family who lied, the goat was the murderer. The goat was the liar. And now the goat was shunned alone and out in the wilderness. And I would imagine if someone saw the goat, they would see all the sins on it and they wouldn't be able to see who the goat had been underneath. And I always wondered, what was it about that goat that got it selected. Because the priest had to look out and see. And I would look at all the other goats and say, that one. And there was something decidedly different. It's always something, but you can't say exactly what it is. And over the years, I've heard about scapegoats and, let's say, politics and all sorts of underhanded things and people get blamed, but that's all I knew was that. And eventually, I did learn more about scapegoats and different things that and the black sheep of the family. And I started to feel strange things while I was in my family. I said, something is not. And I started attending, seeing a therapist. And over the years, I realized that I was a scapegoat. And that explained. A lot. It explained a lot. Rebecca Mansville, who wrote Ridicule, Shamed, and Blamed, said that it is a dysfunctional family that needs a scapegoat. And the scapegoat is the tip of the iceberg, indicating that something deeper is wrong underneath. And dysfunction comes from the fact that, , that there's a lot of things that are wrong. It comes in many forms, but I'll be talking about the narcissistic dysfunctional family, which is a very dangerous and complicated system. And the dysfunction involves dark and dangerous secrets, pitting one person against the other, and not accepting responsibilities for your actions."

Only they could meet your needs. You couldn't be happy without them. You couldn't be healthy without them. Yes, you can. You don't need them. You can learn to meet your own 12 needs. You can learn to have healthy relationships apart from them. You can learn that you matter and that you're capable of meeting your needs and you don't need them. When you can get to that point, that is such an important part of the healing journey. Let me give you one final thing. Many people, when they're going through breaking a trauma bond, they will break the trauma bond, but then their brain will get triggered with a memory. They're missing the person. They feel love again for the person. they're back into their limbic brain, feeling all of the positive stuff. What you need to understand is that your limbic brain gets very distorted. It goes back to fantasy- thinking. Oh, I could just, if we just could talk one more time and try this one more time, it'll be different this time. And it can get you mixed up in a hurry and on the wrong road in a hurry. What people need is a practical tool when their limbic brain gets distorted. When their limbic brain gets distorted, they're back into their limbic brain. They're triggered and they start into all that distorted thinking. What can they do to get back to their cortex, to get back to the facts that this is an unhealthy person, emotionally unavailable, neglectful, abusive. what they do is they write down all the things that person's done to them. They put it on a piece of paper or in their phone."

What is this about. instead of beating yourself up and saying, oh, I've got to stop this approval seeking or attention seeking, why do I do that. Where does this come from. kind of three big things that come out of complex trauma. number one, it's parents that weren't attuned to the child's emotional needs. And your emotional needs were not seen and therefore met. secondly, that's another way of saying you experience something, some type of neglect. You did not receive the attention you should have from your parents. And it could be they were workaholics. It could be they were narcissists. It could be they were very insecure driven. Or it could be, not that they did it intentionally, but you were in a very large family. Or they had their own family business and it demanded all of their time. Or they had chronic health problems or mental health problems. And they just weren't able to be there for you. Another part of this is every child needs validation. That's one of our emotional needs. They need to be told, you're good at that. Hey, you are this way. You did a great job there. That's how a child learns who they are. That's how a child begins to get a good positive self-identity. But some parents grew up in an era where they were told that if you validated your children they would get a big head. They would become proud. They would get a big ego. And parents purposely didn't validate their children wanting to keep them humble."

And if you live a depressed person, even if you don't actually experience depression, you will eventually experience depression. And a lot of the people who tell me , no, I have eternal depression. it does not lift. There's no episodes. It's just always this. This might be the reason. And I say this with all the love, respect, and empathy in the world. Please know that. You've got to shift out of that mode of functioning when you're able to, or it will last forever, but it doesn't have to. Sometimes it's going on and on and on because you weren't doing anything to change how you feel. And I know that it's easier said than done. But if you can train yourself to at least maintain that bare minimum level of functioning, and even when you feel absolutely nothing from it, that will decrease the frequency, the duration, probably even the severity of these episodes. It can flip the ratio upside down. This can be the thing that makes you go from, I am almost always depressed other than when the stars align and I have basically a perfect day to the complete opposite. Almost always. Other than when everything falls apart all at once. We all have those days. I'll have those days. You'll have those days. But if the only times you really get brought down to those depths, are on those days where you just, where it's just all the stuff. It's everything, you guys know what I'm talking about. Everything that could have gone wrong today did. Those days are going to suck. There's nothing you can do about it. But if those are the only days you feel that way, that's a night and day difference. And being able to sustain functioning with delayed gratification is crucial to keeping those ratios around. The third rule I try to live by, and this might sound very similar to the second one. Again, they're all on the same, they're all based on the same foundation. there's some common DNA with all three of these, but I do believe they're worth separating because they kind of land differently, at least in my brain."

What were the child's fears. What was the child's motivations. What was going on in the child's life. If we can approach it that way, often we can begin to bring true, lasting change. , another way to say all of this is, for people from complex trauma, the place to start in healing procrastination is not top-down, motivational, discipline, organizational stuff, though that's going to be important down the road. The place to start is healing the inner child, healing the wounded child. That is key. , that's going to be our approach.

They're procrastinating that important job, that they don't want to do. And , they're still procrastinating. , pushing stuff to the last is one approach. Secondly, it's the person that knows they need to do an important job, but they immediately go to avoid by distraction. , let's do something else. Let's clean the house. Let's play a video game."

Where I would start with that, Lisa, would be to me, validation and love are two core needs that every child has. But what happens within complex trauma is a child quickly begins to realize they have to earn love. Love isn't just given, they have to somehow earn it by adapting certain ways to conform to the rules, etc. there's not unconditional love, it's conditional love. But then that what they get if they conform is they get validation. And that feels love, it feels , oh, I'm getting recognized, I'm getting a sense of value, I'm appreciated, I'm respected, but they're not seeing it still conditional, it's only if I conform, now I have to perform in order to get validation, which now is starting to get twisted in their mind. That's what love feels. if I get validation, then I feel I'm being loved. it's kind of narrowing what love is to validation. But then it's all dependent on I have to perform. And it's all dependent on others must give it to me if I perform. Because what's happening when initially when a child isn't getting the love unconditionally, and they realize they have to earn love, is they are beginning to believe that something's wrong with me just the way I am. I'm not worthy of love the way I am being authentic. I don't me, I can't validate me because I must not be good enough. they stop self validation and replace it with criticism. they develop a strong internal critic that's always finding fault as to why they're not getting love because you did this because you're not good enough here because you're not good enough here. instead of internal validation, they now have internal criticism as the default. And they're not getting the norm. to change that, what people have to realize it's not just changing a behavior. It's actually changing a core belief system because the belief system is it is my fault. That's why I wasn't validated. That's why I wasn't loved. I must not be good enough. I must not have value.

And had she or he not followed the rules at all. He or she has sinned in a sexual or sexual toy. partner. This is all a replay of trying to win over the unwinnable parent. Interestingly, even though a person could grow up in a family system that played out this, again, codependent dynamic, they may actually remain blind to it and not recognize it in their adult relationships. Instead of questioning the unhealthy dynamic, they accept it because it is all they know. And honestly, it would probably be too destabilizing to question it. Becoming educated about the pattern and also being educated about the revelation that these patterns are not likely to change much do rally many people out there out of their blindness to these patterns and can awaken people to make a change. But the risk of just dismissing these patterns in narcissistic relationships as largely codependent and just simply casting the person in a narcissistic relationship in the role of being an enabler or solely as a victim that is complicit in their own abuse, that can often set a precedent that pathologizes a person for simply wanting to make a relationship change.

Self- Massachusetts increasing social Gingerly abuse tuo relationship, I am struck by how many people, once they are educated about narcissism, can actually become quite decisive and get out or at least set very different boundaries. Now do all people get out. No. And perhaps that dynamic, the people who won't get out and just keep staying and staying and hurting themselves in that space, maybe that's more of the codependent dynamic. But the risk of just simply blanket using the codependent term to understand why people get caught in narcissistic relationships can often render the people who are in these relationships as becoming almost feeling that they're powerless. I'm a codependent this is just how it is."

It's almost having your house burned down. , you had a house and now you don't have a house anymore. And I, I, I think that it's very important that in therapy, that grief process gets to unfold because we often give short shrift to people who are going through betrayal trauma. The world may sometimes look at these as people scorned. Oh, they're just her. Cause this person, no, it's much more than that. fundamental truths in their life have been utterly violated. And it's it's therapy becomes a very patient process of letting the grief unfold of empathizing with the client and recognizing that this is an injustice, that there's no magic wand we can wave over this to make it. And then simultaneous to that, a lot of betrayal trauma is perpetrated by people who are sociopathic, psychopathic, narcissistic, manipulative. And some of it becomes a psycho education about what those personality styles are. And sometimes that helps people have a framework. they don't feel as lost. Are there any therapeutic modalities CBT that you would recommend. I think one of the challenges becomes is that, , CBT is change how you think about this,.

I do think that just creating a safe holding space more that we'd see in more of a humanistic style of letting. Person talk it out. I do think an eclectic approach would be absolutely essential here, where you get at some of the historical issues around betrayal. This may be mirroring a betrayal from childhood. Let's say a person's betrayal traumas around infidelity and their one parent cheated on the other that could be really bringing up some old stuff."

Maybe the image of a person that you're struggling with in relationship now, maybe an interaction. Maybe you're feeling a sensation that didn't go very and it's kind of stuck in your system, it just doesn't feel very good. And this is normally the exact kind of experience sensation that we avoid. We try to shove it down, we repress it, we distract ourselves.

Something someone said to you, something they did, something that happened in life that left you feeling unsteady, unmoored, anxious, disturbed. And as you continue to breathe, you can notice where this shows up in the body. Where is the disturbance. Where is the intense sensation that you would prefer.

You are in shock. You just can't believe it. Then you can go to a deep grief. You are just overwhelmed with a deep sadness, often even a hopelessness. Life just is negative, painful, dark. But then you can go to that deep anger, rage. Then you can go to just fear. What now. What's going to happen in my life. And everything is scary. And then you can get paranoid and almost have this kind of terror that you live with. Some go to guilt. I must have done something wrong. It's probably my fault. And that's that self-blame stuff that we just talked about. Others go, it triggers their shame at a deep level. See that proves I'm not worth anything. I'm not lovable. I'm not valuable. If I was they wouldn't have done this. And it just reinforces the deep shame messages. Others just go numb. It's too much to take in. They just go to not feeling anything. And they detach from, others. They just don't want to be with anybody. They just want to be alone. And they're just numb. Then it can lead to just this haunting loneliness. That the person I thought loved me has betrayed me. I am all alone and it is overwhelming. And then often a deep feeling of being violated. Then another thing that begins often to happen emotionally with people is, after they've been betrayed, they have a great deal of difficulty regulating their emotions. all of a sudden they have massive mood swings several times a day, or they get triggered and they just go from zero to hundred in a nanosecond and they can't stop it. emotional regulation becomes a problem. Others then begin to struggle with depression, anxiety, worry, panic attacks. Some go to this apathy. They lose all motivation for life. The things that they used to enjoy, they don't do anything for them anymore. They're just blah. Some go to suicidal ideation."

How to become more real. I think the first step for the ghost is to really buy into the fact that it doesn't help them in what they maybe want. And that what is missing is actually connection and getting them to buy into that is tricky. All of these trauma personalities know in a deep, tiny, secret place that there's got to be something more. And they're about that. Ghosts can be tricky for therapists who want to go into processing places or places of depth, which is actually what the ghosts, they came in for, but they struggle kind of going there. They're going to need a lot of help with that. In groups that are, say, effective and interpersonal working groups, it's helpful. It's helpful for the ghosts to hear from other members that they don't really know them. Ghosts can think that just showing up is good enough to be known, and it's kind of a shock to them. Ghosts will benefit from hearing from others working on themselves, that they want to know them more, and they want them to take some small risk becoming real by actually saying what is on their mind. Even it's , I don't want to be here. My inner child just wants to be home alone. That's something. A good therapist would want the ghost to be able to get to a place in their work to kind of open up, to express themselves, to be more, kind of learn how to be expressive and say what's kind of on their mind, and not easily leave the conversation or easily leave relationships. Coming to the fifth trauma personality is something that I'm calling the are we good or are we. The are we good is a people-pleasing, focused personality that is rooted in the fond response. They are often associated with an anxious, preoccupied attachment style, constantly making sure things are with a partner, and kind of defaulting to their partner to be tolerated. The are we good personality will tend to give away all of their power."

I want to go to kind of four major ways that the sexual drive in a child can get distorted or twisted. the obvious one is sexual abuse. That does much damage in a child that distorts sexuality sometimes. And this is hard to say, but important to say sometimes almost irreparably. I have worked for many years in counseling people with sexual abuse. And sadly, what I've seen with some is that they may never heal to the point. I think that's the key to being able to engage in a healthy intimate sexual relationship. There's just too much damage been done. Too many things get triggered today as soon as they go to engage in sex. It's just sad. Others, they may finally eventually get to a more healthy sexual place and be able to have a healthy sexual relationship with somebody. But it could take years, years and years to get to a healthy sexual relationship. And that's the only way to get to a better adult, that's the only way to get to a better virgin. great patience is required, tons of work is required. There's not a magic fix to just make it go away. Sting andsolvilleblog alright. entrepreneursrubbing. com The second thing and we're going to develop this today that really messes up sexuality is neglect. And most have never really considered that before. And I really want to explained that as we go into our talk today. Whagramughter Arthur Director soundtrack The third thing is grow up in a family where one of your parents has unresolved issues around sex. anything that is sexual in the child, the parent overreacts to. And that can do tremendous damage and really distort the sexual drive of the child. The fourth thing is parents or growing up in an environment that has very repressive teaching around sexuality, almost puritanical. some of you have grown up where it's been taught or you just pick up that sexual desires, having sexual desires, that you're bad, that you're doing something wrong, that's a terrible thing to have sexual desires."

People actually create what they fear. fear causes them to try to avoid certain things and try to prevent certain things from happening. But without realizing it, what actually then happens is you create the very thing you're trying to avoid. You create what you fear. Let me give you a couple examples of that. You look at a child who wasn't validated. They hate that they weren't validated. They never want to be not validated. They try hard to be validated. And what actually happens is they end up creating. They end up creating an environment where nobody wants to validate them because they demand a validation. They're always looking for the spotlight. They're always needy. And they're not being validated, created this huge fear of never being validated, created all of these systems to try to get validation. And what happened. They ended up creating an environment where nobody wants to validate them. They created what they feared. Or take a person who was abandoned. They never want to be abandoned again. Because it hurts much. they develop all kinds of systems, which we talked about last time, to not be abandoned again. And what then happens. They get needy. They test people all the time. Everybody gets tired of it and they abandon them. they create what they fear. I have dealt with many clients that said, as a young person, I will never be my dad. I hate my dad. Or I'll never be my mom. And now 20, 30, 40 years later, they go. I'm just my dad. How did that happen. Somehow I created what I feared. Or people coming out of a relationship. I will never end up with another husband or wife the one I just had. And then five years later, they are in another relationship and they go, this is just the last person. Different face, same issues. How did I end up there. why does this happen. first of all, there's a hyper need that comes out of complex trauma."

Rolfing is a very intense form of massage where they tear your muscles from your fascia. And I came to live in a new body. I no longer live frozen in that body of this little child who almost died. And I think that's a profound effect on me as much as anything I've ever done. Why and how. Because you get stuck in habits. In a way, trauma becomes a habit. My habit is that when I see a phone guy in a room, I get scared. Hypothetical situation. And you have habitual responses. And part of what you do therapy for is to get to realize your habitual responses and become curious about it. , , whenever a person that comes to the room, I freeze and I sound an idiot. And your therapist says, what happens to your body. And how long have you felt this way. Do you feel this way when you were six or three or eight. And then at some point people get a narrative that may begin to explain it. And that narrative may say, oh, I was bullied by somebody. And that feeling comes back when I meet somebody who reminds me of my bully. And that's the first thing that comes to my mind. And that's the first thing that comes to my mind. And then you go , have you ever tried martial arts. See what it would be for you to actually learn to use your body to fight somebody. And that's, for example, a treatment that I have never studied. But I was amazed how many of my close colleagues who are very much into trauma tell me at some point, oh, and now I have to go to my martial arts class. And that is, nobody sees that as a legitimate way of dealing with what they're dealing with. But I think people are doing their martial arts because they have memories of being victimized."

It's my hope that what you hear on this channel will help you cope with these relationships and better be able to navigate the difficult territory of these difficult relationships. we've been doing a series that talks about the family roles people have, golden child, scapegoat, and all of that, and talks about what happens to people in these roles. today we're going to talk about what happens to the golden child. Now this series is, , we've talked about what each of these roles is and I think you have a pretty good handle on it and many of you are clear on what role or roles you occupied in your family. But a lot of people wonder, what does this set me up for. What could happen for me. Or alternately, I'm raising kids, I have a narcissistic co-parent, and I can see my child taking on these roles. What are some of the pathways that are more likely. Now as we work through what happens to people who hold the various family roles, the long-term story for this role of the golden child is actually more complicated than you might think. First, let's talk about the golden child just as a review to ensure that we're all on the same page. The golden child is really what it sounds. The favored child, the one who actually is the favored child of the narcissistic parent who gets things that typically the other children, their siblings in the family system couldn't even imagine getting. Validation, praise, time, attention and resources. The golden child is the golden child, typically for reasons that reflect the narcissistic parent's role in the family. what does this set me up for. What is it that you can do to help the child in a way that is more comfortable. The golden child is the one who is the most important person in the family. The only thing needs. Sometimes the golden child is more attractive to or resembles the narcissistic parent. It may be that they're outstanding in school, particularly obedient or -behaved, or it's the gender that the parent prefers. For example, a narcissistic father wanting a male child."

And that comment goes really nicely with what the last person asked about being in a functional state, but really shut down. Many of our kids were raised pushing them past their comfort zone and overriding the structure in which they go to school. They're not allowed to often sleep till they're rested. The structure is, it's important to some degree, but it's also not allowing their systems to organically find what they need. We need discipline. We need structure and containment. But there's also this other element of allowing the human system to experience what it needs based on its needs, based on its preferences, based on the level of regulation, et cetera. one of the things that my students find really difficult to do is to, , to honor their systems need for rest. Because the moment we try to rest, there's a little bell that goes off in the physiology that says, don't do that. You're not supposed to do that. You're supposed to keep going. You're supposed to keep working. Because if you pause and stop, you might get attacked. You might get in trouble. And these are the things that we really have to be aware to. I can't stress enough.

Neurofeedback is you hook your skull up to electrodes that can harvest the underlying brainwaves. you can produce, you can project your brain activity on a computer screen, and then you can play computer games with your own brainwaves to organize your brainwaves in a way that you can be more focused and pay more attention. I've got some, a graph up on the screen for anybody watching, and it shows five different types of brainwaves. Gamma brainwaves, which are very close brainwaves, beta less close, alpha less close, and then delta, which is when you're sort of sleeping, dreaming. The waves are very, very far apart, almost flat. looking at these different types of brainwaves, if we just categorize them from one being when the brainwaves are really tight and close to five, which is delta when they're really far apart, is one gamma, is that anxiety or something. No, no, anxiety is very focused thinking. , fine. But it depends on where it is. the back of your brain is supposed to have these slow, because your back of the brain is dealing with the housekeeping of your body. The back of your brain tells you have to breathe a little bit more, you have to go to the bathroom, you have to eat, you have to have bodily regulation. A very large part of your brain is about your body regulation, which gets messed up in a major way by trauma. for example, when you close your eyes, the back of your brain is supposed to develop nice, slow waves to tell you, I'm feeling peaceful. When you're traumatized, when they ask you to close your eyes, it is very likely that the back of your brain will get agitated and create much faster waves than you should. And you get a sense of agitation the moment you close your eyes, which is of course very detrimental to your health. my job then becomes how to train your brain that when you close your eyes, your back of your brain becomes very calm. For example. Again, this is not about trauma, it's about brain organization."

All the old coping things and the consequences of it that are now making life painful today. And today we're coming to a key characteristic that comes out of complex trauma, which is the fear of being a burden or a pain. The fear of being annoying because you have needs. In a healthy home, what happens is the understanding is there that your needs are just as important as my needs. One's not better than the other. We're both equal. And we are going to learn. We're going to learn how to love each other in a way that your needs get met and my needs get met. Sometimes, though, I will have to sacrifice my needs in order to meet your needs. And sometimes you'll sacrifice your needs to meet mine. But overall, it'll be equal still. There might be times where I have to sacrifice for an extended period of time. And I'm willing to accept that. you would get that with a brand-new chair. you would get that with a brand-new chair. There's no difference between giving back and not giving back.

I'm not saying that's the case in this one, but you've got to be careful of all these angles. And if this son, for example, is at all trying to get into the family's money, in some ways, it almost becomes a pay to play. Whatever you're paying to do, , to play, you've got to be aware of that. , I think if somebody is willing to use innocent kids as human capital to manipulate adults to get what you want, that seems a lot more egregious than manipulating you to get your money. , I've seen this question a lot in the form of how do I deal with the fact that my adult child is now married to or engaged to somebody who's narcissistic. And that new partner is turning them against us. And this feels it's similar, but how do you counsel parents that recognize that this is actually what's happening. We had a great relationship with our adult child. Now they're in a relationship with somebody else. It feels that person is turning our child against them. How do you counsel somebody in that situation. Is it the same thing. No, it's different,. Because in the case, of the narcissistic son, they're sort of a direct line to the son,. They've known the son his whole life. , who knows what historically has happened. They may, , may very be that they're , , we dropped the ball when he was little. And now we've been trying to make amends ever since. And now that he's got kids and we want access to the kids, we actually, in some ways, it's it's the spoiled child phenomenon. They're doing anything the son wants. That's their own kid. Now, if you have a kid that's yours and you have a great relationship with them into adulthood, your kid is not narcissistic,. But they, they meet someone narcissistic."

It's creating those boundaries, being willing to disappoint people at times, but doing it in a loving way. You can't determine how they're going to react. But if you show up for you, you're taking care of that inner child who has all those wounds that you've written down. And you're saying, I'm the adult in the relationship now, I've got you. No matter what anyone else does, I got you. And those boundaries create peace and freedom. And when you tie that to money, it creates financial freedom. I don't think. We talked about this before the show, but a lot of times with achieving a goal or achieving that success that we want, it's about. It's not just about the things we do, it's about the things we stop doing. Because not having those boundaries, that essentially it's a barrier protection."

A self-object is another person who isn't experienced as a self. isn't experienced as a separate individual, but as an extension of the narcissist's own self, there to provide validation and mirroring. The scapegoat is the ultimate negative self-object. They exist to confirm the narcissist's grandiosity by embodying everything the narcissist is not. When the scapegoat reclaims their status as a separate human being, they are, in essence, amputating a part of the narcissist's psychological self. And let's be brutally clear about the biological reality here. This isn't just emotional dependence. This is neurochemical dependence. The stress hormones, the adrenaline, the cycle of tension and release created by the family drama, this becomes a physiological baseline. The narcissist's body becomes addicted to the chaos. The peace and quiet that follows a scapegoat's departure is, to them, not peaceful at all. It's the terrifying silence of, withdrawal, a sensory deprivation that their system registers as a threat to its very survival. And modern culture, particularly social media, pours gasoline on this fire. It offers the narcissist a global stage for their victim narrative, a host of new avenues for harassment, and a potentially endless supply of superficial validation from strangers who don't know the real story. But here's the thing that's even more disturbing. While the narcissist, the narcissistic parent, is having their identity crisis, writhing in the agony of withdrawal, something else is happening to the other family members who were left behind. The shockwaves of the scapegoat's departure are just beginning to reach them, and the entire rotten structure is preparing for its next, even more catastrophic collapse. What do you do when the person who's been absorbing all the family's dysfunction for 30 years suddenly isn't there anymore. What happens when the emotional black hole that consumed all the rage, all the disappointment, all the bitterness, simply vanishes. If you're the golden child, the one who built your entire identity on the reflected glory of not being the problem, you bloody panic. You panic because the game has changed, and the rules you mastered are now worthless."

And it takes a long time for your limbic brain to come to a point where it can let go. But there's a second thing. And it's understanding the default setting of our subconscious brain. You see, you can let go of something and think, I've let go of that. But then without even realizing it, you slide back into picking it up again. You slide back into that because that's the normal for your brain. That's where your brain is. That's where your brain's lived for decades. That's your default setting, your autopilot. And if you're not consciously, constantly working at maintaining letting go, your brain will slide back into depending on that again, attaching to it again.

But as soon as a man is oppressing women, it starts to look this sort of private issue, and the jump away is to assume that it's something about his emotional world. then there have been various kinds of studies that have been done that don't find really very large psychological differences between abusive and non-abusive men. For example, there's a summary. There's an assumption that there would be just much more personality disorder among abusive than non-abusive men, and there's actually only a little bump in how much personality disorderthere is somewhat a little more personality disorder among abusive men, but it's only a little bump.

Today, I wanted to highlight the American Psychological Association's new guidelines for treating complex PTSD and complex trauma. I was really excited to see that these guidelines were created and posted just a couple of months ago at this point in August, 2024, and that they really validate and emphasize that the treatment and recovery of complex trauma and complex PTSD is uniquely different than the treatment and recovery for regular PTSD. if you're a professional that works with complex trauma, these new APA guidelines are really important. They're not just a must know. They finally reflect the complexity of what many of our clients have lived through and are experiencing related to complex post-traumatic stress disorder. these guidelines were created by one of APA's divisions, along with the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation. And these are professional practice guidelines. They're not just, it's not just a publication explaining a diagnosis, but helping us better understand. What complex trauma is. But these are actually guidelines to guide us in best practices for treating complex trauma and complex PTSD in and across the entire treatment continuum, every level of care and across all treatment modalities. with these best practice standards for complex PTSD and complex trauma, the goal is really to move beyond checklists of symptoms or symptom reduction towards a more contextual, relational, and person-centered care. in talking about guidelines for complex PTSD and complex trauma, we first need to consider the differences. PTSD involves four main symptom clusters, which I cover in detail in other videos. But as a quick refresher, we've got the intrusions and re-experiencing the nightmares and the flashbacks. We've got the arousal and reactivity, the hypervigilance, the hyperarousal, the difficulty concentrating, the irritability. We've got avoidance and numbing, dissociation. We've got negative beliefs and negative moods, distorted beliefs about ourselves, about others, and feeling we're stuck in one emotion all the time. these are the four symptom clusters of PTSD. On top of that, we've got three symptom clusters for complex PTSD, and these are a difficulty with emotional regulation, feeling overwhelmed or emotionally shut down, difficulty with relationships, really feeling we want to be close to people, but we don't feel safe in relationships."

You have the thinking part on the front. And it learns, it processes, it thinks through stuff logically. It evaluates stuff. That's the front of your brain. And then in the center of the brain we have what is known as the limbic system. Which is the doing part. It's the part that when you get kind of in a place of being afraid, you go fight, flight. That's the limbic part happening. That's how this works. If you take what I just told you at the beginning about a child being afraid. What will happen with that child is you have this limbic part that when you see danger, it becomes aroused. It becomes alert. It is kind of alarm system goes off and says, danger, danger. What happens when the parent sits down with the child and says, what. You don't need to be afraid. And they help the child think it through.

And then also there are mental manifestations of shame. what goes on in your mind when you're feeling shame. This is good to know. Because if you can name shame, you're on the path to alleviating it. What goes on in your mind. you may notice you're being self-critical. I was saying, , I could never play tennis. I'm too uncoordinated. Could we recognize that. That kind of criticism.

We feel profoundly vulnerable. Naked, , just Adam and Eve. Naked. Mistrust. Sense of unworthiness. Unworthiness. Incompetence. Another thing the mind does, as I mentioned before, is rumination and self-absorption. Actually, it's interesting. When people are feeling guilty, they're actually less self-absorbed and they're more likely to be able to repair a relationship if they cause somebody harm. When people are shamed, they're just self-absorbed. And they're actually less likely to do anything about it, to fix it. most of this kind of trait shame is actually not. Shame is actually not good for social relations. this is what goes on in us. We start to ruminate, become self-absorbed. the amazing thing about shame is that shame, after all this said, is mostly an illusion. It's an illusion. Shame feels really terrible.

I don't know if I've told you this story. I was in West Hollywood. I was driving my Cadillac that from, that I bought from my money mentor that you met three weeks ago. My, my wedding, Stuart Jenkins, who you're sitting next to. I bought his Cadillac for 5,000 from him when I moved to Los Angeles 13 years ago. And it was a 5,000 Caddy used car was a 1997, , Cadillac Eldorado Berets. Beautiful, , old grandpa car, but it was amazing for me. And I was driving in West Hollywood. Look at these synchronicities that are coming here. I'm driving in West Hollywood in my, my Cadillac. And, , sometimes when you. Roll into a. Stop sign, you slowly go and you're looking left, but you're going to go to the , but you're seeing who's left first. I slowly, I stop and then I kind of roll slowly across the white line to turn, to look both ways. And as I turn back this way to the , there's a runner that's coming in and kind of stops. Cause I'm rolling in front of him, stops and he punches my car and runs around me and says something, some profanities. And I took that as abuse,. He punched my car. He. Ran off and he said something nasty to me. I was triggered at this time. This is 13 years ago. I drove after him. He started going around the block. I'm driving after him. He turns around one way. I go in the middle of street, turn around to go after him. And at one point I stopped my car. I opened the door in the middle of the street and I start sprinting after him. That's how crazy the trigger was for me of the abuse. And I realized, oh, something is wrong. This was all before my healing journey. And I realized, oh, something. Is off."

Now let me give you another reason why people sabotage. And it's what we refer to as pain confusion. And it's thinking, being confused about pain, thinking that bad pain is actually a good thing. some people grow up where they are made to think that love equals pain. And in order to have true love, I need to be in pain. let's sabotage relationships there's pain in. The relationship, pain, confusion, others pain is their normal all their life. They haven't been able to resolve pain. They've lived in pain. And what they don't realize is when something becomes your normal, there's a certain comfort to it. There's something very familiar that just helps you feel, this is good. And that can happen for some people. We're not going to be able to do it. But we can do it when it comes to pain. And then another one is a person who's a cutter or a self-harm person. It releases the body's natural opioids and it makes you feel better. pain makes you feel better. if good things are happening, let's self-harm and that'll make us feel better. Pain confusion. Others from, I don't know, I don't know. Complex trauma have shut down their emotions much that they just feel dead inside, empty inside. And they need some pain to feel alive. let's sabotage because I don't know how to experience and enjoy positive emotions. I just feel dead all the time. But the only thing that makes me feel alive is when I am in pain. Pain confusion. Others, pain is something I can control. Again, the cutter thinks that. let's sabotage stuff and create pain because I can manage pain. For others, I've got much guilt, I need to create pain in order to get justice. I need to punish myself in order to get justice. I need to inflict pain on myself in order to get justice. Pain confusion there. And then for some, pain gets me attention. I hate pain, but I pain because everybody is empathetic towards me and looks up to me. And that becomes the martyr complex that some people have."

Some people tend to be more anxious, some tend to be more avoidant. a lot of this is about self-awareness. What is your unique batch of problems. And a great way in understanding what that is, is appreciating another thing that Rick was talking about that kind of piqued my interest when he said it. Appreciating your coping style. What do you do to regulate yourself. What do you do to cope. And what experiences did those coping styles emerge out of. This is called creating a coherent narrative. We talk about it on the podcast all the time. And it's looking back over things and going, what the heck happened there. And what's the tip of the root for me. What is the core emotional experience that I did not get. What were the steps along the journey that maybe some other people got. Because I've got a friend who's more securely attached, or I can just kind of see other people out in the world, good examples of other people where I look at them and I go, wow, I would really to be a little bit more in my relationships the way that person is. Those kinds of models can be very helpful for us. What did they get that I didn't get. How were their experiences different from mine. What's the big gap here. And this process helps us become much more aware of what we really need, what our specific vulnerabilities are, and frankly, what our strengths are as that might have emerged out of those experiences. Experiences, even truly horrible experiences, often have aspects of them that can lead to the development of some kind of a strength."

You started a one action that trip to trip wire that's got 50 actions that are now all going to flow. And what then happens for people from complex trauma is this, when you had a certain type of danger or disrespect or not feeling heard or seen or being made to feel stupid, that triggered a brain circuit of how you would respond in actions, in your thinking, in your emotions. And you did that thousands of times. That became part of your subconscious. You just did it automatically. now when somebody disrespects you today or you are made to feel stupid today, that trips that circuit. And it's a gravitational pull that wants to pull you to all of those thoughts, all of those emotions, all of those actions.

Somebody has said this, when you make a commitment, you build hope. When you keep that commitment, you build trust. And that's just a very wonderful way to say it. Now, what I have realized over the years is that for many people who grew up in complex trauma, commitment to them means something very different than somebody else who grew up in complex trauma. And it really depends on their experience. And I think that's a really important thing to be able to do. they don't necessarily have a true understanding or picture of commitment and trust. It's very much shaped by their complex trauma experience. just for an example, you might have grown up in a family where your physical needs weren't met very or your emotional needs. for you, commitment means a parent who meets your needs. And that's how you define commitment. And it's very limited. And you're not going to be able to do that. at that point in your life, you're not going to be able to accept what your parents would do to you. Or it depends on how your parents would help you fill your misunderstanding or your understanding to just the meeting of needs. Or you grew up in a place where you didn't feel safe.

It's starting with listening to these basic autonomic biological functions that are in our system. Because if we cannot hear them and sense them, if we can't notice when we have a tight muscle somewhere, or there's a pain, or there's a heat, or there's a tear, or an anger, or a sense of disgust, or a sense of sadness, or this desire to save yourself, or this desire to save yourself, if we're not tuned to these internal automatic responses, A, we're not connected to ourselves, and B, it will be very difficult to track the trapped traumatic stressors and where they are in the body. And we will go into the approach in a kind of one size fits all and just be , oh, , they've said that this is going to help me release trauma. I'm going to go through this and I'm going to do this. And then we're going to do this. And then we're going to go through this. And then we're going to do this. And then we're going to do this. And then we're going to go through these steps. But we're doing it from a cognitive external locus focus, as opposed to what is my system needing to bring up and out. I'm going to pause on that. again, education, and then understanding our physiology, and then being able to listen to our physiology. If I go back to my example of stubbing my toe, breaking my toe on the coffee table, that is an opportunity to teach myself how to feel in the moment because it hurt in the moment. There's no denying it. It's there."

Also, be aware that if you have still lots of shame which has shown itself and you're just shy, not wanting to put yourself out there, that you're probably going to be attracted to attention seekers. You're going to be attracted to attention seekers because attention seekers are not just people who are going to be attracted to you. Because attention seekers to talk a lot.

You're setting up friendships that are starting off unhealthy with old unhealthy tools. just be aware that you don't fall into those old patterns. what do we have to do to heal.

We don't know how mom and dad died, but we do know she was an orphan. And she lived with her cousin who was much older than her. he became a surrogate father. Why that was important is because they came out of a battle where their country was conquered. she was taken as a hostage from Israel to modern-day Iran, which was then known as Persia. And her parents might have been killed in the war, but she comes as a girl orphaned into a strange country. As a hostage where she doesn't know the language or the customs. And her life in the early days has a lot of pain. Her uncle or our cousin Mordecai is able to get a good job. And he rises as far as a governmental position. And we're going to kind of look into all of that story. there's four main characters, Esther and Mordecai. And then the king of Iran was a guy named Zerubbabel.

And in 1970, there was a study at Yale University Medical School about ALS patients by two psychiatrists who wrote the following. These patients, they invariably evoked admiration and respect from all staff who came into contact with them. Characteristic was their attempt to avoid asking for help. Hard study work without recourse to help from others was pervasive. There seemed to have been habitual denial, suppression, or isolation of fear, anxiety, and sadness. no expression of negative emotions, -called. Some spoke gradually of their deterioration, or, sorry, casually, it didn't matter, or did with engaging smiles. Now then I looked up the biography of Lou Gehrig, after whom the disease is named in North America. Now those of you who are old enough might know that Lou Gehrig was a great baseball player, played for the New York Yankees in the 1930s. And he set a record for a number of hits by a New York Yankee that was only broken two years ago by Derek Jeter. that record stood for him. 80 years. Now, Gehrig set another record that stood for nearly 60 years, and that was consecutive games played. he never missed a game. Now, did he never miss a game. And he was called the Iron Horse. I didn't know about this before I read his biography. I just knew he died of ALS. Let's look at what happened to him. , same thing. He was known as the Iron Horse because he never missed a game, and he didn't never miss a game because he was never sick. He was a human being. He had flus and colds everybody else. Furthermore, being an athlete, he was injured. At one point, his hands were x-rayed, and it turned out that his fingers had been fractured 17 separate times. And each time, he would play through the injury, and his teammates would describe him as grimacing a maddened monkey in agony as he fielded the ball, but he never missed a game."

Any questions on what I've said. Yes please. , addiction is something a bit different. It happens when we're stressed and we need to soothe ourselves. when we allow all the stress to wash over us, and we don't keep the stress away, then we get overwhelmed. Then one way to deal with the stress is to become addicted. that, it's very interesting when you look at families with addictions, you also see a lot of illness in other members. they just represent different coping styles. The addict soothes themselves through the addictive behavior. The person with who doesn't go to addiction, they're good, they're going to go suppress themselves and develop illness instead. There's a question here,. That's what I was going to ask you about. The person that has an addiction problem, I've seen this in quite a bit of people. They quit using their alcohol. And then afterwards they become really sober for over a year or something, then they become chronically ill. , what, let me give you the mic that people can hear you. It's a good question. Thank you. People with addictions, maybe alcohol,. they've been using alcohol to help themselves to self-medicate, but after that they stop using alcohol and knowing that their mental and emotional development isn't to par, they become chronically ill."

At that time in my life, to give you a picture of what not having a sense of self looks , for me it looked things this. I couldn't bring myself to disagree with people. I was extremely flexible, if not malleable, with other people. Making decisions was excruciating and I would continuously put them off because I could not make a decision to save my life. And I hid things that I liked or that I was passionate about for fear of how people would think about that. Things books, ideas, bands, whatever. And I would also put up with a lot of off behavior from friends and partners for fear of losing connection. Not having a sense of self is really a security issue. Related to that, I didn't have the skills to bring something up or even know that bringing something up during conflict was an option without blowing up on somebody or having that come out of nowhere, which is a trauma symptom. Being in a relationship for me made me feel and secure rather than having an inner sense of security.

And part two is I need to create healthy attachments. I need to attach to the things and have a healthy relationship with those things and those people. And I'm letting go of unhealthy attachments, that I can replace them with healthy, with even better things. That is the key to recovery. it's not just focusing on the negative. Oh, you got to let go. You got to let go. It's no, you got to let go of unhealthy attachments. It's about attachments. Am I attached to unhealthy things in unhealthy ways. If that's the case, let it go. It's all about developing healthy attachments. You can't let go of unhealthy attachments. You can't recover without healthy attachments. That is critical. Now, as always, I want to bring in the complex trauma piece, because this to me sheds the greatest light on this letting go. It helps people really understand what this letting go is all about. in my mind, what comes out of complex trauma is a whole bunch of things that I develop, attachments to, I connect to that aren't healthy. And recovery is realizing all of the hundreds and thousands of things that I have developed unhealthy attachments to, and realizing if I'm going to get healthy, I got to let go of this person, the unhealthy parts. I got to let go of this activity, the unhealthy parts. I got to let go of this thing, the unhealthy parts. And I have to let go of this activity, the unhealthy parts. And I have to find healthy. let me explain that. several aspects that come out of complex trauma. number one, we connect to things that aren't healthy. we have said over and over again that the greatest drive that a child is born with is to connect, to attach."

And then we had new candidates who looked really bright and optimistic. And my whole system has changed because the future no longer is between a demented person and a psychopath. There's options in the world. Hope. Hope is such an important thing. And your conversation with this Auschwitz survivor, you go , oh my God, if she can survive that, she can survive anything. And you got a sense of hope. And that is such a critical aspect. That's such a critical element. And many people live in an environment locked into TV shows, where they don't have any hope. And I think that's a very important part of our educational system to also give people possibilities. Show what can be done. And it goes back to what we were talking about earlier, which is the importance of any healthcare professional, and frankly, any individual taking beyond healthcare. you want to give that person your way to agency. And hope. And agency. I think it's really important."

If you are two weeks away from taking a nursing exam or the bar exam, or you're in the middle of a divorce, I mentioned, it's not a good time maybe to dive into hardcore trauma and you'll need some support. And as a side note, , the beginning, it's not you're gonna dive into the first couple weeks with a trauma therapist into some hard, really hard nitty gritty, hopefully. There's usually a slow windup, but I think that these still apply in terms of what's going on in your life. A good therapist would read that you, and maybe wanna slow things down, but I think many survivors are maybe impatient to get things going. they've had a therapist before who didn't wanna go there, the clients are really raring to go, but their present life is kind of on fire. And I know it's frustrating, but having too much going on in the present makes diving into our past super nonproductive, I think. The therapy, I could go on and on about this, , from a place of frustration with my field and lack of resources, I mentioned, the general public is not wrong to assume that any therapist should be able to help them with some level of trauma. However, most kind of can't, and they don't have an in-depth training in my experience that goes deep and is effective. And it's probably their, , the therapist isn't bad. It's , if they're a mindful therapist, they're not trained in trauma, it's not their wheelhouse. They're not bad for that. should every therapist be a trauma therapist. That's kind of silly, , but there are some amazing therapists out there of all types. There's also some really bad ones out there, unfortunately. And then there's ones who aren't really that trained. But we assume the field is doctors who generally can manage or refer out to what you need. That's kind of not the case with therapists."

Once you fully, truly understand that, kind of shrugging your shoulders and either ending contact or at the very least minimizing contact and engagement to an extreme degree starts to feel easy. Because frankly, once the people who had these scapegoated roles can shrug them off and maybe even gain meaning and purpose from the suffering of these roles, they really become our rock stars. They can become champions of the oppressed. They can become advocates. They bring tremendous empathy into the room. And they can often be really great bully slayers. And if people who are once scapegoated can trust their guts as adults, they can actually be the best red flag detectors, in the room. I recognize that people who had a scapegoated role have really, really been through it. It can have been quite traumatic. And that these patterns in childhood can impact social and emotional development through the lifespan as attachment and mental health. But I've said it before, I'm going to say it again. In the words of the great poet Rumi, the wound is where the light enters you. And in this way, anyone who has a history of being a scapegoat, or a history of having been scapegoated, is often just brimming forth with light. Pay forward the empathy that you never got from your family. I promise you it will pay dividends. Just make sure you steer clear of the narcissists who are all too happy to snatch away that empathy and keep you in a scapegoated role. for those of you who had that scapegoated role in childhood, I hope this actually is consistent with your experience. If you have had other experiences, that would be great to hear. But it was a wretched role to have as a child. And I will say, another important issue to remember about people who had that scapegoated role in childhood, they often go on to become tremendous parents. Because many people who were scapegoats in childhood vowed that if they ever do get to be a parent, they will never do this to their own children."

really any curiosity about anything in depth and they jump to a conclusion really fast and it's very hard to communicate with people that part about jumping to a conclusion too with parenting it's you are just a demanding child or you're you're the way that there can be a very simplistic oh i know that i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to answer that question but i think it's i'm this way i want deep connection with people and i have family members who let's say not to call anyone out on the podcast but let's say one of my caregivers is really a lot you're describing just this sort of lack of their caring but they have a lack of really understanding about anyone else's inner world they'll say things do you think that people just get depressed i don't know i don't think people are depressed they're just depressed and they can't not feel that way and it's yes i mean of course it can change but i do believe that's real that people can feel that way and then they'll say i don't know i guess i just have had a really good life i just don't understand that and then i know objectively that their life really wasn't all that good growing up it's it's more a fixable function for us to process and i know that would be for best and worst of both fighters question number two what are the goes until you're sadly clouds can make yourself unhappy because they bring up light and oh i'm anxious or you want to know and see what happens and all the arts are going off and on go after yourself and the somewhat fluid way of doing things or the old the old way of thinking about things and that's good but i think one of the great things that you learn is that you it's your mind has to be open let's blood do the most useful when we say the most useful thing and more i'm telling this is the flow hinears upon each other that's an interesting thinking thing i think but i don't think if i have toãåéƒ excited because then all the people who have a lot of superficial i just don't think about it i move on i there is no reflective depth there's no there's no shadowing there's no perspective it's it's just things are very much on the surface and of course if you see the world that way it's really easy to make snap decisions and to see things in black and white and wrong good and bad which is a nightmare when you're a child and your parent is sizing you up that these very extreme categories based on whether or not they what you're doing that's that's hard on the self-esteem it was and if you if you see the way i look at it is in order to be a whole person we really are equipped and made to use both our and left hemispheres of our brain we need some problem solving we need some categorizing abstract sequential thought we need to be analytical that's all great but we need our depth man we really need to be able to have intuition have imagination feel our way into situations have an instinct about something have a that's just deeper than what my social role is ideally i mean i mean they've done much research on brain functioning and what happens when people have injuries to one side or the other the brain and it's kind of been proven that if you're not using a part of your brain enough you're really missing out on the full the full experience of being a human being who can be in relationship with other people i mean it's a big to me it's a big deal it isn't just that these people are kind of difficult or they're a little bit frustrating it's a whole thing about how their mind and how their brain works or doesn't work and that's probably related to some kind of trauma having to do with attachment or security and that all has to come from the hemisphere of the brain i mean babies and mothers relate to each other through hemisphere resonance or kind of that attunement but if you have problems with that early in life and maybe that mother isn't or that mothering person i should say maybe that person isn't sensitive and maybe they aren't attuned over time that child might learn oh the side of my brain is not a safe place for me to hang out because i go into all these feelings and i get these intuitions and i and people look at me i have two heads maybe it just would be better if i became them and stayed over here in the left hemisphere more be very logical be very categorized black and white that i mean i think that's that's a that's a very important thing to be able to do and it's not a big deal to be able to do that because it's not a big deal to be able to do that but it's a big deal to be able to do that it to me it's it's a very big deal because it means when you're emotionally immature that you're not using the full complement of what your brain is designed to do which is to use both sides and both types of abilities yes i i really see what you mean and i and i'll say for myself with my parents and i was a very emotional person and i was very emotional and sensitive i had a lot of stress and i was very emotional and sensitive and i was very emotional and sensitive for me there was i think i was very emotional and sensitive and then became very kind of locked down and disconnected from my emotions as a way to cope and then it was a very difficult process to come back to feeling my emotions but when because i even noticed how in my marriage i would be when taking care of little kids and working and all the things can just become very transactional it's oh who's picking up this and what's for dinner and how are we do we need to go the grocery store and just sort of passing but without that i'm not a very emotional person i'm not a very emotional person and i don't have a lot of time but it's special to what we do and why we do it at home and that's what makes really helping that make that veryapa important we're with an angela and we're with a lot ofTravis."

We've talked about the house of mirrors. if you went into the Red River X with the distorted mirrors and you're six feet tall and thin, but you look in the mirror and you're four feet tall and four feet tall, and you're four feet wide, that's a distorted mirror.

Have healthier people as your mirrors. What I mean is this. Shame was caused by not being able to connect. At an intimate level with people. And you've concluded. That the reason people didn't connect with you. Is because you weren't good enough. It was your fault. And that creates the shame. A huge part of healing shame. Is connecting in a healthy way.

Now, these golden children in a childhood and even adulthood may try to distance from the narcissistic parent. That, interestingly, gets quite tricky, because then the narcissistic parent will treat the golden child with the same rage that they would anyone who abandons them or doesn't validate them. Into adulthood, these golden children may end up quite anxious, a bit grossed out by being affiliated with the narcissistic parent, and may try to spend their lives trying to make amends for what happened. And they may even end up in a very difficult situation because they don't know what happened during childhood. There may be a lot of guilt because they can see what the narcissistic parent's treatment did to their other siblings, especially to any siblings that might have been in the role of a scapegoat. And for the golden child, that can actually result in feelings of shame and self-devaluation. In life, while it seems it could always be rosy and sad, it may not always be. And finally, there is another potential downside in terms of what happens to the golden child. They may end up feeling more stuck and obligated in terms of needing to manage the narcissistic parent as they go into adulthood and older age. This can end up being a bit of a black or white thing. The entitled, the golden child may just foist it onto the scapegoat, the responsibilities of taking care of this aging narcissistic parent, and just no longer deal with the narcissistic parent when they are no longer useful to them. And that unfortunate scapegoated child, now scapegoated adult, still has to hear the narcissistic parent singing the praises of the golden child, even though the scapegoat has to deal with the mess of managing the narcissistic parent. Now, the more psychologically anxious and perhaps the more sort of guilt-ridden golden child, may be the type of golden child who may feel stuck in adulthood, having to be the one who has to support the narcissistic parent."

Or we may feel desperate and act impulsively. Or fly into a rage and lash out. After that kind of outburst, we may feel almost no emotion. And then what would be worse, is what happens sometimes, is we behave coldly to the people we've just hurt. Our affect is flat. My friend told me that when I'm upset, I have a flat affect. That's a blank expression on my face. And it's impossible to tell from the outside what I'm feeling. I look I don't care. When somebody tells me something , Anna, Anna, something terrible has happened. I just go, oh. They think I don't care, but I do care. Maybe I care too much, in fact.

Now, for better and worse, people usually can't tell you're dysregulated by looking at you, which can be good because sometimes you just, that's just a private thing. You want to look you have it together. But on the other hand, when people can't see what's going on with you, you can end up getting into the habit of hiding how you really feel, where you're in this dance where people assume you're , you pretend you're. Actually, you're feeling disconnected and uncomfortable. And you're not going to have a chance to talk to them about it."

Maybe I'll try martial arts. Whatever. Try different things. To find out what you're good at. Now here's what you have to understand. What does shame do when you go to try a new thing. oh.

In the other path where I say, let's go back to unhealthy, I will get short-term pleasure, but even greater long-term pain. I will get pain either way. My limbic wants to go back to short-term pleasure. It doesn't want to factor in long-term pain. I need to get to my cortex and say, hey, I want long-term pleasure, joy. I will endure short-term pain. It's way better than ever increasing greater pain. There's another piece that happens here. Is that whenever I transition from an old unhealthy normal that's been my normal for years, my default setting, to a new normal, it feels wrong. if you've been a people pleaser for years, you've suppressed your desires for years, you've told yourself that it's to suppress your desires and put everybody ahead of you, that's what love means. Now when you stand up for yourself and say, no, my needs matter just as much as yours, I need to be loved better. I need to be loved just as much as I love in order for it to be a healthy relationship, that feels selfish. That feels wrong. When I set boundaries with family, it feels I'm disloyal to family. That feels wrong. to get healthy actually is going to feel wrong for a while. It's going to feel unsafe for a while. And it takes three to six months to transition through that to a new healthy normal that's your default, where that wrong feeling begins to disappear. But be prepared for that because that makes many people think, I'm being wrong. I need to go back to where my limbic brain doesn't feel guilty. And then there's another piece that happens. when you deal with your people pleasing, the issue that you're wanting to change, and you begin to explore it, you begin to realize the reason I people please is because I have shame underneath. I need people to me to feel good about myself. for me to deal with my people pleasing, I have to deal with my shame. Oh my goodness. Another issue. A deeper issue I didn't even see."

And then there's this fear as they become parents themselves that they're going to repeat their parents' parenting style. And often they do without knowing it or even though they don't want to. Because it was what their role model was. That's what their toolkit is. That's what all their subconscious brain programs are set to how to respond to various situations. You go back to how mom and dad responded. The next thing that's just common that comes out of mommy and daddy issues is codependency. the child basically is in a relationship with mom and dad where they're being wounded, their needs aren't being met. All of those things are happening. Mom and dad aren't owning it. Mom and dad aren't changing. the child feels, I have to change. I have to earn love. I have to make mom and dad happy if they're going to meet my needs. I have to become very aware of their emotions, their mood. And I have to respond to them. that if they're in a negative mood, I've got to fix them that they will take care of me. they become, I need to please in order to get love. I have to earn love. But that leads to they're more attuned to the needs of others than to their own. They're pushing their own needs down, thinking their own needs are bad and putting everybody's needs ahead of their own. And then they become part of this culture, and they become part of this codependency. And that's what I call codependency. Codependency is they're willing to accept the odd breadcrumb of love because that's the best they've been able to get growing up. And it felt good to get that little breadcrumb. And it sure is better than nothing. And they go into relationships where they tolerate neglect and abuse and all kinds of stuff. But if they get the odd breadcrumb, then, this, this is not going to be good for me. This is going to be bad for me."

I was trying to get love from unsafe people. And that's where I based all of my equations about relationships and love was with unsafe people. I have to now realize that even though that seemed the truth, it was actually a lie when it comes to love. And I have to learn to be more authentic and to accept who I am and what I'm authentic and to learn to validate myself, not just criticize myself. And what I would say to people is that's a slow gradual process. You just don't do that in a day. There's a lot of self awareness that has to develop in that process. There's a lot of just coming to accept parts of you, you hated identifying lies that you believed and replace them with the truth. Learning to meet your own needs, learning to actually be your own friend is all part of that process. But what you're doing in all of that process is actually, it's an informal type of validation. Because you're treating yourself as if you matter. You're treating yourself with respect. And that is a form of validation. And then when you require others to treat you with respect or else I'm not going to have a relationship with you, you're actually validating yourself, not verbally, but through your actions. And that to me is a lot of people when they think of validation, just think of it as a verbal process, but actually it's more an activity, action process. In the initial stages, because what I find for a lot of people, they early, 30 years ago in therapy, it was look in the mirror and tell yourself how wonderful you are. Tell yours validate and tell yourself. And I would ask clients, how many of you have done that. And they'd all put their hands up and I go, how many of did that work. And they, most of them, nope, you're doing verbal validation, but you're not backing it up with action validation, standing up for yourself, saying, treat me with respect, or I'm not having a relationship with you. That's where the validation has to begin."

Another one, people who live with chronic physical pain. just living with pain takes a ton of energy. those people get depleted. People that are fighting a sickness, an infection, a virus, get depleted because it takes a lot of energy to fight those things. People recovering from surgery, where their body's doing a ton of healing physically, are very tired.

And they can become very depleted because of that. those are all physical things. But what I want you to realize is that's only a small part of what depletes us. One of the things that depletes us, probably more than anything, is emotions. let's talk about that. Because for people from complex trauma who've suppressed emotions, disconnected from emotions, they don't realize how much energy emotions take. And what we find for many people who take our LIFT program, or REACT program, is after a couple weeks, they're just exhausted. And they go, why. I haven't been doing anything. And they're still thinking in terms of physical activity is the only thing that makes you tired. And I go, no, you're doing human's work when it comes to emotions now. And you're exhausted because of all the emotional work that you're doing. And that's a new concept for them. , things that deplete us in the emotional world, and it's fascinating to me what they're finding out, is when you have stuff emotions all the time, you've got anger coming up, you stuff it down. You've got fear coming up, you stuff it down. That's intense emotional stuff that you're stuffing. If you go through loss, and you stuff it down. It's holding a beach ball under water. It takes a lot of energy to stuff down an intense emotion. And you get to play. And because of that."

And we were certainly going to drown. And again, it would have been the end of my life as , of course, before it started. And, but then the small sailboat came along and there were two people in the sailboat and they rescued my parents. One was their older man. And the other one was a young woman. And they introduced themselves as, I don't know, a woman. And they introduced themselves as, I don't know, a woman. Albert Einstein and his stepdaughter. And my mother reasoned that because he saved my life in that moment of life threat, that somehow we would stay connected. I know this sounds totally weird. And sometimes, and only recently would I have the courage to even talk about this because I would be afraid of people thinking I was weird. But I'm not afraid of that anymore.

These 60 people who are teaching semantic experiencing. But the question, am I enough. I think that is a work in progress. And that was really what I was trying to ascertain in writing the book for myself was, am I enough. And what does that mean. And what does it mean to me."

Some people in unhealthy relationships they want to get their own way and their partner's not going along with their agenda. they recruit two or three people to put pressure on them to do something that the other person wants. But what I want you to understand is they're putting pressure on that person to do something unhealthy. that's the wrong type of what we call triangulation. What we're talking about here is we're getting people who will support us and care about this person who's living unhealthy and we want to put some pressure on them to begin to be healthy again. Very big difference. you take those people and you go and you talk to them. Another piece with that is they can act as witnesses. if the person you're confronting later goes to everybody and says this person said this to me and did this those two or three people can step up and say no, that's not what happened. We were there. And they can prevent a lot of distortions from happening from the parties involved. But what happens when that person still doesn't respond to two or three people. You go to part three. If the person still refuses to listen take your case to the and that is to your surrogate family to your people who are on the same path as you. tell others about it and if he or she won't accept the 's decision treat that person a pagan or a corrupt tax collector. this has often been misunderstood. let me explain it. And I think you'll see the wisdom of it. It's often misunderstood and presented in very much a shunning an excommunication a very severe thing. And I want you just to get the big picture of what's going on. first of all, is not saying appoint yourself the moral police to stick your nose into everybody's business and to tell everybody if they're wrong or not and to always create drama by confronting people. He's not talking about doing that. That is very unhealthy. He's talking about your close relationships and managing those relationships."

The other example I'm going to give, if we think about a goldfish in a bowl of water, which is how you often see them, there's this concept in science, in biology, where if the fish is sick, do we help the fish or do we make sure its environment is healthier. The water is healthy. The water isn't filled with toxins. Do we just give the fish medicine and then plop it back into the environment that's toxic, or do we clean up the environment and then let the fish respond to a cleaner environment, and over time it starts to heal. I'm sort of laying that idea that would be called terrain theory, for example, where we change the terrain. We change what we're offering the fish for its nutrients and its goodness, its home. for humans, when we have a cut, for example, I'm going to pull this back together. Don't worry, guys. When we have a cut on our hand and our system is already under stress, it's going to take a lot longer for that cut to heal because the system is trying to figure out what it should fight next. Who should I attack today. What should I forget. What should I disconnect from today. And it doesn't know how to address just that thing and go into healing mode. all of that, let that settle. For us here today, I will make the assumption that many of you are here because you have old traumas, old survival stress. Your system is living in some form of fight, flight, freeze, some form of maybe dissociation, which is also called derealization, depersonalization, disconnection from the environment. We aren't able to even see what's around us. We're kind of a walking zombie. Or the flip side, we are hyper aroused. We are hyper vigilant. We are always looking for the next thing to attack us. In this state, we will actually create drama. We will create drama to perpetuate the old traumatic expressions and wires in our body because that's our MO. We know how to be that way. We don't know how to be calm and soothed and engaged with the world."

And my mom fainted, fell off her chair. And my father said, look what you did to your mother. And my then wife and her, my father carried my mother into her bed. I don't know if my mother was sexually abused. She just fainted when I asked her the question. But that's how it goes. You barely get a straight answer to any of these things. You said that child abuse and neglect is the single most preventable cause of mental illness, the single most common cause of drug and alcohol abuse and a significant contributor to leading causes of death, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, stroke and suicide. That's true. And in your book you say that eradicating child abuse in America would reduce the overall rate of depression by more than half, alcoholism by two thirds and suicide, drug use and domestic abuse. Drug use and domestic violence by three quarters. That doesn't come from me. There's data from this very big CDC study run by Vincent Filetti. this is data on 25,000 people. People have got increasingly interested in their early childhood experiences as a lens to understand who they are as adults. Is that overblown or is it important to understand. It's not overblown to be curious about how you became who you became. And what the internal ingredients of your cake are. I think that's very good for people to be aware of how they have become the creatures who they are. I think being curious about yourself is very necessary also to be curious in order to be curious of other people. When you said about your mother and the incest thing, you'd realized as an adult much of your work focused on incest. And then you turned to your mother and asked her if there was an experience she had and she fainted. Do you believe that there's a part of you that knew."

And both are necessary to keep the relationship going. Do you realize if the person who takes the abuse and says, I'm content with a few crumbs, they could have left. Many, many times, but they stay there. I work with addicts every day. And the question I often want them to consider is, if you look inside of yourself, you are a whole bunch of desires and hormones and chemicals and needs. And those needs and desires and drives are all in competition with each other. you got a desire for sleep, for food, for sex, for relationships, for position, for power, all in competition. In a healthy person, there's one drive, one need that trumps everything else, and that is love. I will have a sex drive, but never to the point where it violates love. Love will trump that. What happens in an abuser is things begin to trump love. And as soon as something, begins to trump love, you can become an abuser. And we all have the potential to be abusive because we all struggle every day with competing desires. And sometimes they do trump love. We get selfish. An abuser is the things that consistently trump love are there all the time. And that becomes the main part of their life. Love still pokes out. Once. And a while. But other forces are the more powerful forces in their life. let me give you a couple examples. if a person has this sex drive, it can become a lust thing. If it trumps love, guess what you have. I want my sex drive gratified. I don't care if I hurt you. That is where the sex drive has trumped love. And then sex, then becomes abusive. It becomes using of other people. Second one, greed. We all have this desire. I want money. I want position."

This isn't someone asking for support because when someone truly needs care, they don't wait till the final moment of a meeting when no one has time or energy to help them, but this is a super common narcissistic tactic. They wait until the exit and then they drop something heavy to force emotional investment. here's how you test it. In that moment, you don't dive in. You don't reopen the conversation. You just hold the line politely. You can nod or say something nice to them , I'm sorry you're going through that. But then you close the meeting as planned. Again, this is about your behavior.

And we try to get it resolved, we eat food, we drink water, etc. And we can resolve it, and that thirst goes away, because the needs been met.

If they've come out of complex trauma, they've come out of just existing and not thriving. They come out of surviving, but they've never really felt Zoe life. They had to kill that inside of themselves. First thing I think it's important to realize is that their existing survival mode, that was their default setting. That was their normal. And part of their brain is naturally just going to gravitate back to that. They know how to be a robot really. They know how to shut down things really. And just be aware that tendency happens. But secondly, realize that anytime your nervous system feels stress or danger, in other words, it gets triggered, it's going to want to go back to normal. And that's what I want you to do.

First one to look out for is that something in you pulls away from people. You pull away from connection. Connection is what you really need now, but you actually, your brain is pulling away from connection. You think that isolation, is a better way to go because connection requires energy."

And there's a lot of, every time I do this, this happens. Or you never do this. And stinking thinking is a cognitive reaction to threat. Remember I said when we feel stressed, when we're in a dysphoric mood, we tend to notice the threats and we tend to interpret or perceive things in the environment the most nefarious way possible. And that makes us feel even more unsafe in our environment, which promotes more anxiety, which promotes an even darker view of the world, people's intentions, etc. Stinking thinking is a big area for adjustment in a lot of people. And it's not just addictions. We see this in people with depression, anxiety, and anger too. People with codependency and to a certain degree, addiction many times, have difficulty identifying and expressing their reality. They grew up not having any models, not having anybody help them develop their emotional intelligence, their ability to identify and regulate their emotions. They never had anybody help them develop their communication skills and learn how to assertively state what they feel. And they never had anybody help them feel it was safe. They never had anybody validate them and say, what, it's safe to tell me your reality. I may not agree with it, but it's safe to tell me your reality and there's not going to be mega negative repercussions. for a lot of different reasons, people who are codependent often have difficulty even putting it, identifying or putting into words what they're experiencing."

You are in shock. You just can't believe it. Then you can go to a deep grief. You are just overwhelmed with a deep sadness, often even a hopelessness. Life just is negative, painful, dark. But then you can go to that deep anger, rage, then you can go to just fear. What now. What's going to happen in my life. And everything is scary. And then you can get paranoid and almost have this kind of terror that you live with. Some go to guilt. I must have done something wrong. It's probably my fault. And that's that self-blame stuff that we just talked about. Others go, it triggers their shame at a deep level. See, that proves I'm not worth anything. I'm not lovable. I'm not valuable. If I was, they wouldn't have done this. And it just reinforces the deep, deep shame messages. Others just go numb. It's too much to take in. They just go to not feeling anything. And they detach from others. They just don't want to be with anybody. They just want to be alone. And they're just numb. Then it can lead to just this haunting loneliness that the person I thought loved me has betrayed me. I am all alone and it is overwhelming. And then often a deep feeling of being violated. Then another thing that begins often to happen emotionally with people is after they've been betrayed, they have a great deal of difficulty regulating their emotions. all of a sudden, they have massive mood swings. They have massive mood swings. They have massive mood swings. They have huge mood swings several times a day, or they get triggered and they just go from zero to 100 in a nanosecond and they can't stop it. emotional regulation becomes a problem. Others then begin to struggle with depression, anxiety, worry, panic attacks. Some go to this apathy, they lose all motivation for life."

Pete Walker in his book once again talks about how self-medicating can be something that we do in order to try to prolong a state of thriving and refuse to accept that we're now in a survival state. And the way that I've come to think about it is that those survival periods are my opportunities to practice deep humility. No matter how much work I do in my life I don't ever want to believe that I am above struggling. whenever I find myself in that state of survival I'm in a state of resisting something difficult that I'm going through which happens frequently. I do not go down without a fight. I try to reframe it as it is my time to be taught. It is my time to humble myself and let life teach me whatever lesson I currently need to learn."

They don't have to justify their no. They can just say no. But practice saying no. Practice setting boundaries. Now I need to say that when you say no and set boundaries you're probably your initial internal response is you're going to feel guilty. You're going to feel that you're selfish. You might even then get accused by those in your family who are used to you being a people pleaser. They're going to accuse you now of being selfish. They're going to even accuse you of being a narcissist. And that's where you need a healthy person that's going to come and say no. You're not selfish. You're not a narcissist. You're finally standing up for yourself. ignore what other people are accusing you of. You're going to need help to work through the guilt and the false accusations that you receive. Then pull back from relationships with people who just want to use you. People who are selfish, self-centered, who don't take your needs into account. People who are selfish, self-centered, who don't take your needs into account. Avoid relationships that you realize are becoming just one-sided.

I need to sabotage all that's going. I go back to failing because that's what I deserve. sabotage becomes part of complex trauma because there's many fears that come out of the different ways that we live. And part of recovery is realizing, becoming aware of the times when my impulse to sabotage kicks in. And often it could start subconsciously, but I become aware of it and I go, whoa, I'm not going to sabotage here. I am going to trust the process and I'm going to get out of my limbic brain, get back into my cortex and stick with the plan. And that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to get out of my limbic brain. I'm going to get back into my cortex. I'm going to get back into my brain. And it's really a very strong plan and they become very thankful that they did. The next fear is fear of conflict. Most people from complex trauma don't deal with conflict. They hate conflict. in a healthy home, conflict, you realize conflict is part of every relationship. You don't always agree. You misunderstand each other. You have different tastes and preferences. You do things sometimes accidentally that hurt each other. conflict becomes. part of normal relationships, but what happens is the goal is we want to resolve it. We want to grow from this. Both of us want to grow. We want this to turn into improving our relationship, fixing a problem. you work at it with respect. You work at it out of love. You work at it with a desire to grow, and that's what happens. conflict turns into a very positive growth thing, not in complex trauma. Nothing good comes out of conflict in complex trauma. There's always going to be a winner and a loser, and the person who wins is going to punish the people who lose. you're not only going to lose the argument, you are going to get then shamed."

And what can happen if you are struggling to pay the bills, you feel extra guilty that you can't get your kids lots of gifts.

Some possibilities that can very much the others be learned from having a shutdown or a ghost- parent or avoidant parents can be from significant neglect where there really wasn't any joyful kind of connection in the early years, and then having to go through a very lonely, quiet childhood where no one was home. They're kind of not socialized maybe in that way on a deep level. If you picture a super-social child, they're kind of a super-social child, but they're a severely neglected child who gets themselves up and fed and out to school in the morning. And then they're alone again when they come home from school until nine and when a parent comes home. And then it's ten. There's a lot of alone time. It's a lot of having to shut down for a minute, minute. what I mean. That's actually very dissociative experience for a child. A kid will have to find ways to cope with that kind of abandonment on a daily level. Another possibility is being overwhelmed by a larger-than-life experience. The ghost can be a very negative kind of energy vampire parent or that there was much intensity from violence or chaos that the ghost rightfully kind of shut down. This is also highly common."

Don't tell anybody this, but if you use code DOAC22, you'll get 22 off on some of Plord's products. I was trying to understand. What it feels to have a true lack of confidence. How does it feel inside your body. And the research I did showed there's really four areas that you feel it. The first area is in your body physically, the tightness in your body, which could be clenched jaw. It could be that fidgeting you see, heart racing, all the fight or flight responses. The second way you feel it is in the mind, self-doubt, asking yourself always, am I good enough. Kind of double guessing yourself, running through worst case scenarios, ruminating on your past mistakes. The third way is in your emotions, which is the way you feel when you're in a situation where you're feeling you're not doing. And then the third way is in your emotions, which is the way you feel when you're feeling you're not doing. And then the fourth way is in your emotions, which is this feeling, this insecurity that you might be exposed at some point, avoiding speaking out too much or holding yourself back. And the last way is in behavior, which is speaking softly, rushing your words, avoiding eye contact and apologizing too much. I feel that's such a waste of time. to spend, to sit and analyze yourself. Now, if you're not a good speaker, I look at it as I want to work on my speech. It's paralinguistics it's called,. I want to try for my, the best tone I can that I can speak with authority. Research shows that it's not what you say. People sometimes sit and memorize what they're going to say, the words they're going to use. When in fact the research shows what you, how you say it impacts people more than what you say. the way that you speak is clearly resonant with people.

A narcissist is always checking to see if they can press a button and make you change your behavior. To test your time boundaries, they'll wait until you set a small one, you say you're heading out, or you're going to bed early, or you've gotten time off next week. Then they press, maybe with guilt, maybe with excuses, maybe with passive aggression, and they watch. They're not testing what you say. They're testing what you do. If you shift your schedule, delay your exit, or give in to the guilt, they learn something, that you're someone whose time can be taken. To see if they can take your attention, the process is kind of the same. They push buttons to capture your focus. The setup is simple. You're already focused on something else, you're in a conversation, or a meeting, watching something, reading, thinking, and that's when they strike. They might try to text you while you're busy, or follow up again if you don't answer fast enough. They might pop over unannounced, and expect you to stop what you're doing. They might just cut in on a conversation, stand in your line of sight, or talk over what you're watching. And then they watch to see if you're gonna drop what you're doing, to see if you're easy to pull towards them. If they can break your focus once, they're gonna do it again, and it will escalate. To see if they can feed on your energy, they set up a trap, and then watch what you do. The setup is subtle, but deliberate. They forget something important, or they act helpless, or they bait you in with drama. They stir up guilt, conflict, or pity, just to see how fast you step in. And then they watch, to see if you're gonna protect your energy, or if you're going to hand it to them. If you take responsibility for their mess, if you jump in to calm them down, if you explain, or soothe, or carry what isn't yours, they know you're now a source."

But a lot of what they'll do to sow those divisions is how they how they react while a mom and a kid are having a struggle. if mom and kid are in the middle of a struggle and he starts to ridicule the mom. , that kid's going to become a major behavioral problem rapidly if he does that over and over again. If he conditions the child to believe that the mom doesn't care about them or that the mom is out sleeping with other men, they'll start telling a four year old who doesn't even really know what it means. Your mom is out sleeping with other guys. And will really pollute that relationship. And it's to me, it's largely a divide and conquer mentality. It's I get more power in this situation if I have these people turned against each other. It also means he gets to be the center of attention more because then everybody's focused on him. He can even make himself the family good guy who's helping these other people work out their conflicts that he's creating. And then it also means that the mother can't parent the child in the way that is best for her. And she can't parent the child in the way that is best and organic to her because she's mediating that parenting through managing his potential reaction to her relationship with her child. she doesn't get to be the mother basically."

It is understanding that betrayal can wound you, but does not have the power to define you. It is recognizing that love, courage, and truth are stronger than manipulation, cruelty, and deceit. When you transcend, you embody these truths not as abstract ideals, but as living realities, visible in how you move through the world. How you speak, how you act. Leadership born from suffering is different from leadership born from ambition. It is quieter, deeper, more authentic. It is not about drawing attention to yourself, but about pointing towards something greater. It is about walking with those who are still wounded, not from a place of superiority, but from a place of solidarity. It is about bearing witness to their pain without flinching, because you have been there yourself. It is about holding a mirror up to their strength, when all they can see are their failures and their fears. It is about creating spaces where healing can begin, where the lies can be dismantled, and where the truth can take root. You are not meant to live forever in the shadow of what was done to you. You are meant to rise, to build, to create, to inspire. You are meant to take the lessons carved into your soul and turn them into wisdom that liberates not only yourself, but everyone you encounter. The darkness you walked through was real, and it was brutal, but it also equipped you with the kind of light that cannot be extinguished. You are not merely a survivor, you are a beacon. A testament to what is possible when pain is faced with courage and turned into power."

You're only putting yourself into a spot where you're going to do it again and again and again. An angry person starts fights. A hot tempered person commits all kinds of sins. In other words, anger is an emotion that leads to all kinds of bad things. it's not just the anger that's the issue. It's all the things that get done while you're angry that are hard to stop and you can't take back and do all the damage. Ecclesiastes, which is about Solomon, we talked about, it says, control your temper for anger labor. It enables you a fool. Have you ever seen an angry person acting out and you roll your eyes and go, how childish. How immature. , very quickly, causes of anger that are given in the. Proverbs, Solomon says, pride leads to conflict. Those who take advice are wise. what he's saying by pride is the person who thinks they're always and always be in conflict. Because they're never willing to look at their own stuff. In their mind it's always everybody else's fault. nothing will get resolved there'll always be conflict. Secondly, a proud person, you can't teach anything. they're never going to want to look at themselves honestly. they're always going to have conflict. Next thing, pride people always put their needs and their desires and their wishes ahead of everybody else. pride makes you inherently selfish. I want my way more than your way. I demand my way. And when you get a person with that kind of pride, they are always in conflict because they got to step on people to get what they want. They got to use people to get what they want. And they create hurt and conflict. pride leads to lots of anger. Next one, James 4 says, what is causing the quarrels and fights among you. Do they come from, don't they come from the evil desires at war within you. Then he explains it. You want what you don't have. you go, my neighbor got a new car. I want a new car."

Can you bridge those two things or where they might come from. Leave a comment if you think that you can. I think the best resource is to find a therapist or healing arts person who gets it and can help you process your family system. That's the first place, but I know that finding someone that is super hard, much less affording them. when I start with clients, I have them do a genogram with me. I have an e-course that walks you through how to put a genogram together. In addition, there are three other e-courses on my website that are helpful in processing childhood or the family system, including a talk I did on shame that includes a worksheet on how to do the inner child dialoguing. You could also do some journal writing about what your family system is in the present to begin with and think working backwards about the system on the whole."

This is one of the great tragedies of unchecked narcissism in later life. Because attention is fleeting. But identity, true identity, must be rooted in something deeper. Something earned. And if you spend your whole life performing, you'll reach the final act with no one left in the audience, and nothing left inside. if you're watching this and recognizing these patterns, either in someone else or god forbid in yourself, it's not too late. But you have to ask the hard question. If no one is watching, who am I really. Because only then, only when you stop chasing applause and start facing yourself, can you begin to live with truth. And that's the only validation that ever mattered. Number 6. Increased rage and resentment. One of the most alarming signs that a narcissist is worsening with age is the rise in unfiltered rage and deep-seated resentment. This isn't just occasional frustration or irritability. Those are normal parts of aging. No. This is something much darker. It's what happens when narcissism left unchecked for decades begins to curdle. It turns bitter. Toxic. Explosive. You see, when a narcissist is young and still relatively powerful, when they can command attention, sway others with charm, and manipulate subtly, they don't need to show you their rage. The performance is still working. The illusion is still intact. People are still clapping. But over time, as their tools weaken, when the beauty fades, the energy wanes, and the charm no longer hypnotizes, what's left is the raw, festering resentment of someone who's not even there. And that's what I'm talking about. The world is now in a state of resentment of someone who has always needed the world to bow, and now watches it walk away. This is the psychological breaking point. Because narcissists never believed they were simply part of the world. They believed they deserved to dominate it. And when that domination becomes impossible, the mask comes off. The fury comes out. Rage, for the aging narcissist, becomes a default response to reality. They are furious that people don't admire them anymore. Furious that others have surpassed them. Furious that the world dares to evolve without them at the center."

You can totally let go of all the blame because it's not your fault and you don't have some kind of crazy preference for drama, you're not seeking out people who hurt you and you're not trying to recreate your childhood. Have you ever been told these things. I mean really the common symptoms of CPTSD from childhood are normal responses to abnormal circumstances during your developmental years, you did not do this to yourself. Yes there are psychological elements and those can in turn into self sabotaging behaviors and I deal with that a lot too in my courses and coaching programs, but at its root CPTSD is a neurological injury that disrupts brain energy. CPTSD is a neurological injury that disrupts brain energy and also disrupts the brain activity. And that's what we call CPTSD, it's a neurological injury that disrupts brain and body systems and then that in turn affects your health, it definitely affects your health, it can cause chronic disease, it can cause learning problems, relationship problems which you've noticed, financial problems, depression, anxiety, addiction and this is a big one that gets overlooked for example, it can make it impossible to make clear-headed decisions when you need to make a clear-headed decision when you're stressed. Now there's a lot of wrong information out there, you see it on tv it just drives me crazy in movies and tv a traumatized person finally just talks about it to some therapist or friend and just because they talked about it everything magically goes away and they're better and I just I wish it were that easy and it's a little different than that but of course it looks it should work from the outside, it looks we just aren't seeing that we're traumatized or we're just not getting something."

They don't feel they're good enough. But they've never looked at it. They've never dealt with it. Because their priority has been performing perfection. And now in adult life, they still don't look at it. But because they're very capable, they put all their energy into performance, to doing work, signing up for the latest committee, etc. And all of that, they do stuff, they do stuff, and their focus becomes image. I can't fix my internal, is their thinking. I can't fix that shame. let's build a perfect house of cards where I do everything perfectly on the outside. And some go even beyond just performing lots of activity to having the perfect body, to having a house that's always neat, to having kids that are always dressed up and in sports, and high achievers. Everything becomes about looking good. And as they do that, and most are able to do it for a while, people applaud them. People say, Wow, I wish I could be you. You have your act together.

And they asked why, because obviously I was picking up the language that was happening around. And they said, , because she'll have an accent and you need her to assimilate. They wanted me to be able to assimilate. That was the doctor's saying out as a goal. my parents stopped speaking that language directly to me.

Your body is the most honest witness to your life. It carries everything. The fear, the shutdown, the flinching, the bracing, the breath you didn't take. The tension in your shoulders when someone raises their voice. The way you dissociate when you feel cornered. The ache in your chest you can't explain. These are not random. They are memories.

Not to sabotage you. But because the body is always trying to protect you. Always adapting. Always preparing for the worst, based on what it has survived in the past. It is trying to keep you alive, even if that means never letting you fully relax again. Here's the truth most people miss. Trauma isn't just something that happened to you in the past. It's something that continues to live inside you. In the present. In the body. In the way you breathe. The way you react. The way you hold yourself. That's why healing trauma is not just about talking. It's about listening. Listening to your body. Because the body holds everything the conscious mind tries to avoid. You may not remember what happened when you were six, but your body does. You may not remember why your stomach tightens in crowds, but your body does. You may not know why you panic when someone raises their voice, but your nervous system remembers. And it responds instantly, often without your permission, long before your rational brain has time to catch up. The problem is, most people try to outthink their trauma. They try to heal from the neck up. But trauma is not stored in the thinking brain. It's stored in the survival brain and the body. That's why insight alone is not enough. That's why talking alone is not enough."

Remember, they said it's often a symptom of something bigger. It's not a disorder on its own. anxiety, PTSD, BPD, even autism. you could be trying all the coping mechanisms in the world. But if you're not addressing the underlying cause, it's kind of putting a bandaid on a broken bone. First of all. problem and then finding the most effective path forward. Which really sometimes it might involve medication. Absolutely. Medication, it can be incredibly helpful for managing those symptoms of the underlying conditions anxiety or ADHD. But it's not a cure all. Exactly. And this is a really important point. Medication can be a powerful tool, but it's not a magic solution that instantly gives you those emotional regulation skills. It's the difference between turning down the volume on a siren and figuring out how to shut the damn thing off. You might get some temporary relief from lowering the volume, but you're still going to be on edge until you can actually address the source of the noise. Absolutely. And that's why the article emphasizes the importance of therapy alongside any medication. It's about addressing both the symptoms and the underlying mechanisms driving them. we're talking about emotional regulation as a skill you can build and not a character flaw that you're just stuck with. But this isn't just about understanding yourself, is it. It's about understanding the people around you, too,."

I need others to approve of me in order to feel good about myself. I don't have that feeling good about myself inherently within me. And all of behaviors are trying to get others to keep feeding my need to feel good about myself. And the person doesn't develop a secure sense of self. They continue to depend on others to provide the feelings of self. it often then includes this overemphasis on status, appearance, social acceptance, money, achievement, any kind of thing that will gain them approval, gain them attention. somebody has said this, these children tend to do in school and be behaved because they're seeking approval."

I mean, this there's a universality, , to this, but what I love about Darvo is I think it takes gaslighting and it, it gives it the final punctuation point,. Because when we think about gaslighting, it's denial,. That I never said that I never did that. It's attack. There's something wrong with you. What the heck is wrong with you. But that last piece, that last piece of reversing victim and offender, I think that still remains in that second part of gaslighting, which is to sort of undermine the, the, the person being abused. But I think it puts it in very stark focus because what it does is it plays on the empathy and the compassion and the equanimity of the person being abused. they'll say, Oh, wait a minute, maybe I am wrong. And there's not a case out there where we have not seen Darvo use. I mean, I think that's the big cases of perpetration. Weinstein, Bill Cosby, R Kelly. I mean, think of Harvey Weinstein rolling into the courtroom into in the wheelchair. Look what you've all done to me. I can't believe this is being done to me. I mean, after how many, how over a hundred women that we know of were perpetrated against, that was Darvo happening at the highest levels. But this framework, whether if it's a massive news story involving hundreds of people, or it's simply happening in somebody's interest, somebody's personal relationship, it takes gaslighting and it creates a much more holistic model of what happens in these relationships. I think it's also more specific. we've now got measurement instruments for Darvo experiences, being Darvo'd as Darvo use your tendency to use Darvo when you're accused of something. I have copies of those scales here. Dr. Fry's Darvo use scale is available in our studio. in our show notes and on our Instagram at navigating narcissism pod."

Part of complex trauma is that you're going to have times where you legitimately question your perception because it's distorted because you're angry or you're in fear. that's healthy questioning your perception. What's happening in gaslighting is even when you're not in an emotionally escalated state, you start to question. You start to question your perception. The times that you normally in the past would have been accurate in your perception, you now question and doubt yourself. you are having less confidence in yourself. Thirdly, you begin to conclude that maybe they're and I am too sensitive. Maybe they are and I make too big a deal out of things. I just need to get over stuff. I let too much stuff. I let too much stuff bother me. Again, complex trauma, often we do overreact. Gaslighting, they make you question everything as an overreaction. And it takes it one step further than just the natural consequences that come out of complex trauma. Three, or four, you constantly apologize. you are with a friend and you're not going to apologize. You're going to apologize. You're going to apologize. And you say something and then you go, oh, I'm sorry. I hope I didn't say the wrong thing. Or sorry, I might have hurt your feelings. And after a while they go, would you quit apologizing. Because you have been trained that you're always wrong. That there's nothing you do that is ever all. There's always something wrong. you say something wrong. You do something wrong. you are trained to apologize all the time. Next one is you feel with that you can't do anything wrong. You can't do anything. this is when those subtle seeds and messages that have been happening for months from your partner are starting to take their toll.

By over helping the addict or over giving to them, in essence, enabling the addict's substance abuse by not drawing the painful boundaries. This whole terminology of codependency describes a family system that's often characterized by patterns such as denial, lack of communication, and again going back to Cermak's definition, a restricted expression of emotions. overall. When we look at the range of definitions on codependency, codependent individuals are often observed to deny their own healthy needs. And they attempt to save or rescue the problem person in the family system. For example, the alcoholic. Whether by denying the problem or by repeatedly rescuing them with caregiving or money or other resources. Now definitions of codependency have since broadened beyond addiction to take in other kinds of problematic, difficult relationships including just generally difficult family dynamics. Family dynamics that center around abuse as relationships associated with other mental illnesses and personality dynamics. But the general idea is that one parent. Or other adult family members. Just keep sticking it out with the toxic person despite the harm it is bringing to everyone. Namely, their children. Now in my experience of working with hundreds of people in these family situations, I have to say that I have observed that being raised in an invalidating family can absolutely create the risk of a person's life being affected. And that is the most common dynamic in these families. Because maybe if you were enough, someone in your family system would have had your back. Or maybe the invalidating things you are regularly told were true because no one had your back and advocated for you and they would have if you were enough. Over time a child for no other reason than for survival may also have a very strong sense of self-esteem. And that is the most common dynamic in these families. Some of these children, at the age of 23 through 27 may also participate in denying the problems within the family. what it is, everything is fine. Our family is great. Everything is fine."

And what you understand as a parent is child has many needs, but you teach them tools that they can meet more and more needs on their own, but you help them also recognize there's still going to be some needs, even as an adult, they'll need others for help. as I work with people, I want to ask, where are they at in their growth.

If I help somebody who's still at an infant and doesn't have the tools, they need my help. That's a good thing to do. But if I help somebody who has tools but is just not wanting to use them or is lazy, I would not be loving by doing it for them. I would be enabling them to not grow up, to remain stuck where they're at in their immaturity. when people come and ask me for help, I need to be able to ask, where are they at.

On stage yesterday at the master series conference in Oxford, I asked you a question. I said to you, if you were writing The Body Keeps the Score today, what would you change. And you said to me, the only thing you would change, the only thing which I found staggering is that you would add a new chapter on psychedelics. many patients tell me that life just feels a blur because of the pressures that many of us face. The busyness, the overwhelm, the endless to-do list. I've heard it time and time again. Why haven't things changed. Why can't I bring these healthy habits into my life and make them stick. I've been a medical doctor for over two decades and I have to say one of the most transformative practices I have ever seen is the practice of journaling. Because it breaks. It breaks. It breaks the loop. We have these unconscious patterns, these subconscious patterns running our lives. We don't realize how many anxieties and worries and concerns we have whirring around.

You seem something I said before is upsetting to you. Could you tell me a little bit about that. Explain to me what it is that you're worried about now. Describe to me what you're concerned about. We used to call it TED. Tell me, explain, describe. It's just a great way to get people talking. Just get them talking. But going back to what you're saying, it's just everything is very about me, me, me. We've become identity-based that we don't reallywe're not connected to the community around us and how we impact others. Everything is what's happening to me. What's in it for me. Me, me, me. It's , do that you impact other people. You tell them. You tell them. You tell them. You tell them. You tell them. You tell them. You tell them. You tell them. You tell them. You tell them. You tell them. You tell them. You tell them. You tell them. You touch other people. You affect other people's lives. You make other people's day better or worse. You make the work environment easier or more taxing. You do that. But everything has become myself."

First lesson that I wish every person with CPTSD had known in childhood is that the neurotic behavior and emotional regulation strategies you almost definitely developed if you have complex PTSD are not character defects, they are trauma responses. if you have trouble with things eating disorders, substance abuse, social difficulties, obsessive thought patterns, chronically low self-esteem, all of these things and many other things that you may have been struggling with are not things that you chose. They are the mind and body's normal response to a set of abnormal circumstances. if you are missing some key element that you needed for healthy emotional development, your brain is going to do the best it can in order to help you self-regulate. And your brain's best attempt at self-regulation, if it doesn't have the tools to actually contextualize your emotions and make sense of what you are feeling and why, is going to be to develop things really rigid behavior patterns, addiction, anxiety, and depression. And if you're not able to do that, then you're not going to be able to do it. if you're not able to do it, then you're not going to be able to do it. And if you're not able to do it, then you're not going to be able to do it. All of those things are going to make it difficult to do things give yourself a sense of stability in life or to form healthy attachment relationships, because you simply did not learn enough of the necessary skills to do those things in the quote unquote normal way. But none of that was a choice, which is likely what you were led to believe growing up if you didn't have any context for why you were doing any of that. You probably learned, I am just doing all of this weird stuff and behaving in weird ways because I am a different flawed, wrong, broken person. But I'm going to say it one more time."

And what I said in that opening talk on that was, in my experience as an addictions counselor, one of the main causes of things that lead people to a relapse is they get into a relationship that is a codependent relationship. And before we know it, they have become back into kind of addicted to a person. And all of their addictive behavior and all of their old ways of doing things kick in. And before it, they're all messed up inside and they end up relapsing to the drugs or alcohol. it is a huge issue that many in recovery have to deal with if they ever want to stay clean and sober. But then I said beyond that, I don't think codependency is properly understood until people understand the complex trauma. And that, to me, is significant because one of the symptoms of complex trauma is it sets people up to become codependent, which means it sets people up that their relationships aren't healthy and end up failing. that's why I want to do this series is because it's such a big issue for people in recovery. It's one of the most common questions that I receive from clients when they are trying to recover. And I think that's a big issue. And I think that's a big issue. And I think that's a big issue. And I think that's a big issue. And I think that's a big issue. I think that's a big issue. I think that's a big issue. I think that's a big issue. And tonight I want to take it a little bit further. And what I want you to understand up front is that when I say codependency, I have a spectrum in my mind. there is kind of mild codependency to severe codependency. you might say, I don't think I'm codependent because I'm not in the severe end of the spectrum. But you might have some of the more mild parts of codependency that still can get you into a lot of trouble in a relationship. taking that, what I want to talk about tonight is the more severe end of the codependency spectrum."

And the other person always feels lack of safety due to the disconnection. They feel lack of safety because the other person is not meeting their needs. Narcissists create complex trauma environments. And the longer you stay in it, the greater the effect on you, and it takes its toll. if you realize, wow, I have complex PTSD because of my relationship with a narcissist, please get help. You will benefit much from getting help with a therapist, with taking a course our Lyft course, to really help you begin to deal with all that, all that stuff. And the ramifications are huge.

Low self-esteem was on everybody's radar and you got to love yourself. But what they were saying was you have to try to create feelings of love for yourself. And what I found in working with people with tons of shame, they couldn't stir up good feelings to themselves. if they went to a workshop and they said, look in the mirror and tell yourself you love you and feel all warm and fuzzy to yourself, they're going rolling their eyes going, who is this quack job that's running this class. Because I, can't stir up any positive feelings. And I said, for deeply shamed people, that does not work initially. Where they have to start is not try to get warm feelings to themselves. They have to start by saying, I accept me. I choose to accept the body I was given. I choose to accept the personality I was given. And what does shame say. I don't want to be the guy who's the first one to accept me. I choose to accept the other. I don't want to be the guy who's the first one to accept me. And what does shame say. I don't who I am because I think that's the reason I've been neglected and abandoned. I wish I wasn't a shy, quiet person. I wish I was the outgoing leader that was funny all the time. And you wished for a different personality. You wished for a different face and all those different things. You start by making a choice. I choose to accept this package. I choose to accept the way I was born. Now that is easier said than done because you've never done that before. And what's going to happen is once you start to want to get down on yourself because you're feeling your shyness and nobody's wanting to talk to you because you want to sit in the corner all by yourself. You go, what. I'm shy. Instead of seeing that as just a negative, I wonder if there's positives from being shy. And you think about it from a positive perspective. let me give you this. When I was young, I was super shy. I was super analytical."

have survived there's moments stephen truth be told i'm looking i'm you're lucky you're a good-looking man otherwise i don't know the there's moments where that'll save the relationship but i digress i forgot what you asked because i took you in a different direction because i was really just curious to see because i would see it with high presidents and i would see with certain people and i experience it myself too sometimes you get this and i would think you would get it a lot and that's a really tough thing i would think i would say though some people that have been extremely successful in my company they were also big followers of the show i'm thinking of you christiana christianus who is our chief revenue officer she told me she's listened to every episode ever actually in her application she used in the subject line chapter 19 of my book and then in the email there were several things that i'd written in my books she's an unbelievable performer because actually her career and her life and her passion is also the work it can be both but it can't be different and i think that's the thing that's really important to me is that you're not just a person who's i'm gonna do this and do this and do this and do this and do this and it can't just be oh i just want to see what the challenge is it what i mean it can't just be a surface level any is there anything else that is really pertinent on the point of that guy backstage that said to you that gave you that advice which was kind of a little bit patronizing it sounded that you said it wasn't but it kind of it didn't take it that but i'm also i also don't get easily offended to me i looked at it you have to really say that you're not gonna be offended i think i think my offensive levelness is probably my tolerance is higher than others is that a good thing yes because in the job that i came from you couldn't get you just couldn't get impacted with people as easy you have to think of it this way it would be something stupid steven i probably here in new york once president barack obama he went out to dinner and i had to tell somebody standing by the restaurant ma'am sir could you please just cross the street and stand there because we had to clear the area and people lose their minds you're violating my phones come out they're yelling at you in your face now the new york me or the evy me wants to just punch him in the throat go across the street i don't i don't have time for this she can't do that when you have a job where people dislike you because you're law enforcement and they're in your face and when you're telling them to do something they automatically you have something called reactance nobody to be told anything nobody to feel they don't have control over their alliance you their life they have reactants which means immediately they're going to push back a really good example is covid people losing their minds when they were forced to wear masks and a big reason it wasn't really the mask it was that they felt that they had no autonomy you're telling me what i have to do and i feel i have no control in law enforcement you're typically dealing with this often where you can't offer people a choice typically it's i need you to do this when you have people really escalating and getting in your face and in many situations wanting an altercation they want to put on you want to put on youtube you want to put on social media you have to manage yourself also my mind i'm you're not going to get that from me you do have a higher threshold to tolerate a lot more nonsense if i was someone who was really disrespecting you when you were doing your job and i was shouting in your face you told me to get across the street and i started cussing you out and being very personal and trying to sort of exacerbate the situation what would be going through your head at that exact moment i'm now screaming in your face i've got my phone out i'm telling you're live on instagram what's what is actually going through your head versus what you're displaying externally what i would say is ma'am or sir whoever it was i appreciate you frustrated however i'm not able to have you stand here could you please go across the street what's going on up here how many times i'm going to say this before i force this person across the street before i put handcuffs on them that's what's happening in my head in my head i am doing mathematical equation how many chances do i give this person before i throw on handcuffs have you ever had someone insult you in a really vicious just horrible way it's dummy barbie and does it offend in inside even if you don't show it i don't want to say you get used to it but in a reality of everything you want to do there's gonna be a Yong sweaty and that a little divide it supposed to incredibly but a' i mean that's what i thought at the time i don't know what's going on i don't know about what's going on but no one i die and i don't know what's gonna happen when i'm gonna be behind thePaul saying it a little he says calling you dead private life to go into tertiary sure you're trying to force someone to leave panel that's no problem look i want to say want to make me go out and i want to just retentively sorry for this case in the end i'll just leave you there we're sorry i'll leave here for you to you they're committing crimes you really could lose a lot of faith you really could become really cynical it's actually a common trait in law enforcement you have to be really careful to not become overly cynical because you're seeing the worst of people and they're also bringing out their worst behavior for whatever reason people are not their best the best version of themselves and again you're also typically not dealing with the good citizen you're dealing with people who are consistently com committing crimes if you look at crime in general the vast majority of crime it's committed by the same group of people and the majority of arrests if you look at the arrests they're misdemeanors meaning driving while intoxicated they're smaller things felonies really serious crimes these are people who typically violate the law consistently when they're this is happening i we would memorize what the usc would say is that the law is not a law it's not a law it's not a law it's not a law it's not a law the secret service did is they taught us to fight with facts i fight with facts we actually memorized the title codes 18 title 18 usc was it 3056 that gave me the to do what i needed to do to secure and protect the president of the united states and if you were interfering with that then the law gave me the to arrest you if i needed to i didn't want to arrest anybody i didn't care but the law gave me that because now you're impeding in my ability to do my job one of the things that i learned from the law is that you're not going to be able to do anything if you're not going to be able to do anything if you're not going to be able to do anything things i would do is i would say ma'am you are now impeding with title 18 3056 and i would say the title of what it was which says that i have to do x y and z here's the thing i don't want to arrest you but you do need to move across the street you can move across the street and i can get somebody to come talk to you or it's going to escalate it's up to you most people steven most listen but a lot of people theatrics you said it's up to you that's giving them an element of control which is good that's a good point i think that's a good point i think that's it's up to me look at the end they have to do it because i have to do my job but the majority of time but you've given them the choice because you said you can either this or this yes but sometimes you have to repeat it 15 times to people before you actually do it here's the thing once you put hands on people the last thing you want to do is put hands on people the minute you put hands on people everything breaks back they're going to freak out somebody's going to get hurt they're going to it's it's not a good thing the majority of people i would arrest after i would arrest them i'd have to take them to the hospital not because i did anything to hurt them but my heart hurts i'm stressed i have i don't know what's happening i have a headache i don't want them to die on me and the majority of the time i would take them to the hospital or they were faking it i've had people fake heart attacks because they thought i'd feel bad and take the cuffs off and i'm are you having a heart attack let me put the cuffs on we're going straight to the hospital and i would take them to the hospital there's a lot of tactics people would use to also get you to stop manipulators which people can do the average person not in this way but ways people can manipulate you to stop whatever it is you're doing let's say you're trying to find out the truth of something or you're in you're trying to get to your asking questions and a person doesn't it they may start crying people would cry when i would arrest them as a way for me to feel sorry to stop often people will use things to get you to feel bad to leave the hospital and they're not going to leave them alone let's say you're going to fire somebody because for something they did and you're asking them questions and they start crying in the office instead of asking the questions that's a way to deflect to get you to feel bad to stop your line of fire of questions to get you to stop very common very common crying it's a manipulation tactic and there's other things people can do people will use certain things to get you to stop what you're doing and sometimes people fall for it or they'll say things to you're only doing this to me because i'm a woman or because i'm this and those sometimes not that they're not true but a lot of times it can be used as manipulators to get you to back off in that scenario you're being met with emotion and it appears that you're returning logic because you're talking about the title code and you could i guess return emotion but no you own your emotion nobody should provoke you nobody you're stephen bartlett director of ceo nobody provokes you own your responsibility but that's not what it is you're going because you've you're going to take that out you are going to take the responsibility and do you want it and whoomo bs no he trained you in that space but at the same time had other people's opinions and whole way your strongly against the truth makers what i happened was you say stuff about And sometimes I'm , stop."

It's been an exciting season that we're in, a season of growth. Many of you are newer to the church. And if you're interested in becoming officially a part of us, we would love that. There's a brief application, but it's basically saying I'm all in. I'm officially a part. I want to support what God is doing through this local body and help carry the load into the future. We believe God has great things in store for our church and for our community in this area. And we'd love for you to be a part. And if you would just see somebody in the back, you can also check out more of what this means on our website under the membership link. And it'll give you more of an idea about what does that entail. And just that it's not just about being in a club. This really is about being. On mission to reach people. I mean, we've got the big letters across the back here among us that you can see every week that we want to love God. We want to love others and we want to make disciples. if you want to be a part of that mission, we'd love to have you officially join us by being a member of our church. All. Let's jump into it today. Last month, if you were here in August, we spent about five weeks walking through this. And we're going to talk about the book of Jonah. And if there's one thing that is pretty obvious from Jonah's story, it's that he definitely heard the voice of God. We see it there in the very first verse of the book that the Lord tells Jonah to go to the city of Nineveh and to announce God's judgment against them. But what we don't see, and we didn't really talk about this during the series. That's why I want to bring it up to you today. What we don't see is Jonah wondering, is this really God telling me this. We see that God spoke, but maybe we don't really know exactly how. Maybe God spoke to him through some kind of messenger an angel."

The next thing is part of self-care and media life is to be able to meet my needs. And self-care is meeting my needs is meeting my needs with things that my needs need. I have to figure out my and dislikes. I have to feel out what feeds my soul, what causes me enjoyment. hobbies, things that I can do that just are fulfilling for me. I need to figure out those things. Self-care has to have self-compassion. I need to think through myself. I need to stay depleted. somebody has said it's the golden rule in reverse.

Instead of you scrambling to answer, they're left scrambling to figure out why you're not reacting. It throws them off balance. Third, you protect your energy. Every word you waste on someone who doesn't value it, drains you. It's understood. Silence keeps that energy where it belongs with you. I want you to imagine a narcissist throwing every insult they can at you, expecting you to blow up, to cry, to argue. But instead, you sit there calm, maybe even with a little half smile stood and you give them nothing. Do how maddening that is for them. It's trying to start a fire with wet matches. It doesn't catch. And in that moment, you've already won. You're stood. Because you're not feeding the fire, you're letting it burn itself out. Silence is not passive. It's active. It's a choice. It's restraint. It's the discipline to hold your power instead of handing it over. Stood. And it's one of the most effective strategies an empath can use because empaths feel everything deeply. They want to explain. They want to heal. They want to smooth things over. But sometimes the strongest form of empathy is protecting yourself. Stood. And silence does exactly that. It protects you while disarming the very person who's trying to control you. the next time you're tempted to defend yourself to someone who's not listening, I want you to pause. I want you to breathe. You're stood. And I want you to remember that silence isn't weakness. It's strategy. It's strength disguised as stillness, the quiet confidence that says, I don't need to fight you to win. When you set a boundary, you're not being rude. Understood. You're not being cold. And you're not being selfish. You're being clear. You're drawing a line that says, this is where I end. And you begin. And when it comes to dealing with a narcissist, it's understood. Boundaries aren't just important. They're essential. Because narcissists test limits constantly. They push. They prod. They overstep."

The second thing is that there is a difference between being somebody who is anxious or avoidant or disorganized in their romantic relationships but has a pretty secure attachment paradigm to say their friends and their parents than being somebody who is disorganized pretty much across the board or who is anxious pretty much across the board. I would describe myself as being quite anxiously oriented with other kids growing up, but pretty secure with you guys. All the way up to very secure with you guys. That was a pretty darn secure relationship for me. Because I knew what a secure relationship looked. I had a model inside of me of a kind of connection to fall back on. Which is really quite different from somebody who has never developed that kind of model inside of themselves. And this means that somebody who grows up in a situation that's more disorganized or has early childhood experiences that aren't safe and secure in that way, things can be particularly tricky for that person because they don't they don't have, they've never had that experience of how could this be different. They have no model to look to be , what's a different version of this. where does this come from. It comes from a lot of different places. A lot of the time, again, growing up early childhood experiences, chaos, disorganization, a parent who was either way too involved and then totally disengaged from you or not involved at all, can also as I said, sometimes come from more traumatic adult relationships where there's sort of this oscillation inside of them. And really what I want to pull out from this is lack of reliability. Because it's inherent in disorganization as a whole. We've talked a lot on the podcast about how important consistency is for kids. The world seems a pretty crazy place in general and they are totally dependent on one or two or a small number of people for their safety and security. they really feeling they understand things and they kind of know what's going on. And more often than not, disorganization comes out of environments where that was not present for that kid. Is there anything that you want to add to that, Dad. , as usual you've done super prep.

Oh, he can't help it and we changed our expectations adjusted the rules. It just made our whole house run smoother. We didn't have this resentment this frustration with him. It was different and he obviously suffered a lot less and I believe that you could use that in this situation as. Just working with the emotionally immature people in our life. That's interesting. Do you think that this is partly a generational issue. our parents and our in-laws they literally never had conversations around emotions and now Millennials and on we're all trying therapy or listening to therapy podcasts or reading books children of emotionally immature parents,. we all have this language and this mindset around emotional growth and we expect that other people would be doing that too. And the other generation is , huh. I don't even have a framework to talk about that. ,. And that's what I'm saying is I think that we're assuming we're looking at a 60 year old and they're going to have the same emotional tools that we have. They just have to build them up. And I am just asking the question. What if they're they truly don't have access to those tools and it's causing a lot more suffering than necessary. I'm not saying going no contact or estrangement isn't necessary in certain cases. we'll get to that in the discussion because even once you understand their limitations, you change your expectations and then you set healthy boundaries, which you control and you enforce you still have to decide is this relationship sustainable or not because some people are. Unhealthy that it is not sustainable."

That's in part because of the striatum, which is our autopilot system.

It can be reprogrammed by starting to give it deep social connections that it longed for in the first place. you can retrain it that it longs for deep social connections again. And if we do that, we need to practice social connections, not reactive behaviors instead of compulsive behaviors. It's not enough to just teach healthier responses to cues from our social reward system. In other words, it's not enough just to give people tools to cope. We have to rebuild the social reward system with reciprocal relationships to replace the drugs which relieve the craving."

And then when you get to adult life, they end up causing you to be wounded, the other person to be wounded, and they do not work at all. that's what we're going to look at. But let me back up and just give you a little bit of background on this term connection or the technical term is attachment. what do we mean when we talk about connecting or attaching in a healthy way. What I do in thinking about this is what would it be if a child felt sick, safe, that they could drop all their guards, all their masks, all the walls around their heart, they would be able to be able to be emotionally connected to somebody who was emotionally available. Also with that, they would need to have their needs met in order to feel that safety, in order to be able to drop their guard. they would need to feel totally accepted. They would need to feel totally accepted. They would need to feel totally accepted. They would need to feel unconditional love. They would need to feel respected. They would need a relationship that was consistent for them and that was fair and there was honesty. Then they could be authentic. what I've said in the past is this. Children do not lie because they decide it's a good idea. They lie to survive. Children want to be authentic, but in an unsafe environment, they can't survive. They can't survive. They can't survive. They can't survive. They can't be authentic because if you're authentic, you get hurt. And they learn to not be authentic. And the question of connection is, you can't connect in a healthy way unless you live in a safe environment where you can be totally authentic. And I think what you can see up front is that children raised in complex trauma cannot form that connection. Not because they don't want to. But because it's not safe to be authentic. And that's what we're talking about. if I take that a little bit further, children need that connection all the time, but they need it most when they're feeling afraid or when they see danger or when they're feeling unsettled or uncomfortable."

There was no more expecting her to do certain things or be a certain way just because she's my mom. It's just. She was still acting the same way. She was still asked for money every few months. She was still being herself. But your relationship shifted inside of you. As a matter of fact, she asked for me to help her fix her car. The one that you bought her. No, no. A different one. A different car. And instead of that, I got her a new one. Oh, that's pretty baller. Wow.

No. But your relationship shifted within you with her. And she kept being the same. She didn't change, but you shifted. And it helped heal you. Yes. That's powerful. That's really powerful. let's move to number two here. number one, identify your money triggers. Number two is to write it down. I just think it's powerful to identify within your mind and think about these stories, but then write down a kind of a list of these triggers, these wounds, these things. you can have them in the forefront and start to address them one by one, start to process them. Start to see what acts can I take that will support me in overcoming these things that cause me anxiety in my nervous system when I think about it, or cause me these triggers. Just having the awareness, writing it down is a powerful act. I love that. I love that. It's bringing it, it's just again, getting it out of your head. Getting it out, man."

God has already given to us what He wants to say. Now, I want to pause here because I know the dilemma that we have. And I've sat where you are and wondered about this same dilemma and just thinking, oh, , pastor, but the Bible has a lot of different things in it. It has some pretty intense stuff. If you go back to the Old Testament, it's got some pretty violent things, pretty grotesque things, things that sound harsh and judgmental. how does all of that fit into hearing the voice of God today. Dr. Joseph McClary, M. D. : Maybe you've wondered that before, or maybe even now. You're wondering, how does all this work. And it's really an important question to ask. let's talk about it for a minute. One of the keys to bridging the gap, which we could say that there's a gap between the God of the Old Testament and the God of the New Testament, is this, that it's the idea that God has always been the same. Let's start there. He's always been holy. He's always been a God. He's always been a God of justice. He's always been a God of mercy. But here's the thing, the way that God relates to people has shifted depending on which covenant has been in effect,. the way that God relates to people has shifted depending on which covenant has been in effect. This is important. in the Old Testament, or we could say the old covenant, God gave this nation of Israel some really specific laws. Some were laws about worship, some were about sacrifice, some were ceremonial type laws, some were about how their society should run as a nation. They weren't all just religious laws. Some were moral commands that reflected God's character and God's eternal nature. And , these civil laws and these ceremonial laws that existed in the Jewish temple, they were good and they were for Israel in that season. But they were also pointing forward to something greater. They were pointing forward to the ultimate redemption, the ultimate sacrifice to the coming of Jesus in the New Testament."

And it's hard to believe or even think that anger might be a good thing in certain situations. here's how anger was designed to work. In us, we have this built-in, without even realizing it, moral system of what is love. And we know that if you love somebody and want a healthy relationship, you have to be honest, you have to be reliable, you have to be faithful, you have to communicate, you have to respect each other, you have to be consistent and fair. That's built in. It's into our DNA. if somebody lies, what do we do. We get angry. And what the anger is saying is, alert, alert. Alert, something is wrong here that should not continue because if it continues, it will damage this relationship and it will damage each other. anger was designed, number one, to alert you that something was either unloving, disrespectful, unfair, and not true. And then the second thing, it was to give you the motivation to make it again. And it was to give you the motivation to make it again. And it was to give you the motivation to make it again. And it was to give you the motivation to say, we got to talk about this. that it could be resolved that the relationship would go back to honesty and fairness and consistency and reliability. anger was a beautiful system that was designed to protect love and loving relationships. That's important. And secondly, anger was designed to be resolved. that if something's unloving, it will not be resolved. It resolves it, and then the anger goes away. There's no more need for it because it is resolved. that's the original design. And what helps that whole system is that when you are angry, your brain releases a chemical called cortisol. And that chemical is only released with anger and fear, slash stress. Danger. and fear, slash stress. Danger. Corsosol is the chemical that gives you the adrenaline rush. It gives you extra energy. It makes you hyper-focused. And it is saying, this has to get fixed. This has to get resolved. And it's giving you all the help possible to have the energy and the desire to resolve this, to return it to love. what happens in complex trauma."

That means learning to detect when a need is not being met. again, we've done talks on this that hopefully you can go through and that will help you learn how to do this.

All of those needs, I am learning to meet consistently. And I am learning how to detect when those needs aren't being met. important.

Secondly, self-care always will involve an element of connection with myself and with at least one other person at a deep, caring, vulnerable level. That is, such an important piece of self-care. don't lose sight of that. Self-care, there's an element you can do all by yourself. Do it alone, but there's an element of connection that is always going to be needed because that is one of our needs. Next, part of self-care, especially the crisis stuff, when I am depleted, is I need to learn emotional regulation. I need to learn how to manage all of the stuff that's coming up because I am depleted. I'm irritable. I need to be able to manage that. I'm feeling some discontent. I need to learn how to sit in that. I'm feeling some anxiety and depression. I need to learn how to manage that. there's always going to be elements of self-regulation and learning healthy self-soothing that are part of self-care. Let me take it a wee bit deeper. To be able to take care of yourself in a healthy way means I need to put a higher priority on my own pleasure and enjoyment. Now to some people that immediately sounds wrong. That I am being proud, that I am being selfish, that I am being a narcissist. Not if it's healthy. Do you realize that you can't love others from an empty cup. if you're a narcissist, you can't love others from an empty cup. if you're not filling your own gas tanks, your own cup, you're never going to be able to love others properly."

Investigations in prisons show that 40 of all young male inmates have an ADHS, many untreated. One of them is Tim. Do you think it's fair that you are in prison. For all the things I did, I always sat down. I got a lot of chances, a lot of election penalties. Tim was sentenced to six and a half years in prison for heavy robbery. He was drug-addicted for a long time and was therefore always fined. Would you say you have ADHS. Yes. I always had a higher or stronger drive to move, I would say.

they try to make up for abusive behavior with repairing behavior that includes exaggerated compliments extravagant gifts or trips or telling you that they can't live without you it's important to remember that abuse is rarely 100 of the time a lot of times there is repairing behavior in an abusive relationship in the abusive cycle what happens is you have the abuse that occurs and that may happen for a while then you have the repairing then you may have a period of dormancy where there isn't really any abuse things maybe are tense but everyone kind of stays away from one another whatever it may be and then the abuse occurs again for whatever that may be then after the abuse is done then you have the repairing behavior which is again the love bombs that i just mentioned number five you feel everything that's wrong with the relationship is your fault emotional abuse often includes convincing the other person that they need to be criticized and told what to do but they're not going to be able to do it because they're not going to be able to do it because they're not going to be able to do it because they're not going to be able to do it because they're not going to do it because of their poor behavior and decision making ability and if they were better there wouldn't be a problem in the relationship number six is your disagreements turn into intense fights this rather than being productive arguments blow up into yelling and insults that feel very threatening and very scary number seven this is you never know which version of your partner you're gonna get very unpredictable they're hot and cold sometimes they're up and down sometimes withdrawing or insulting and then they draw you back in by being suddenly attentive and loving remember the love bombs of number four and a lot of times this can be what i to call narcissistic tease strategy which is at first they abuse you and they make you feel low which makes the narcissist feel very strong and powerful then once that person or if that person is able to is felt low enough small enough then they decide to leave then what happens is the narcissist or a lot of them can be very charming and very loving or they're very good at reading others and what they need then they see that they start to play on that then the person who was experiencing the abuse the receiver of the abuse then it's oh maybe he or she's changed and they go back and then again you end up on that cycle number eight you get shut down when you try to communicate the other person dismisses your needs or concerns or responds to them with sarcasm and disgust number nine you've lost confidence in your own perspective you've been told many times that you're wrong stupid or crazy that you've started to believe it remember whatever we tell ourselves over and over again will eventually be ingested and become part of our perception this can go for the negative certainly but it can also go for the positive try to catch those negatives replace them with positives balance thoughts about yourself genuine caring thoughts about yourself and the last one number 10 is you've forgotten what you used to be before the relationship you no longer spend time on your own doing things you care about or spending time with close friends that you don't remember what it felt to be a strong and independent person now some folks have never felt a strong and independent person i think in those instances what we need to do is we need to revisit how we would imagine ourselves or initially visit how we would imagine ourselves to be that strong and independent person what would that be what are those components get as concrete and clear as you can in what are those traits what are those traits that you admire in other people that seem strong and independent how can you get those traits learning different ways of thinking and behaving it doesn't always happen after you go to a place a first level instance a new experience some people go to other schools because they're feeling very depressed they feel the same as somebody whatever that wall is really hard to understand what's happening but really i think it's really important to build that relationship with your interactions by analyzing the ресur業's counterfle gestellt v what's happening what's happening in social interactions what's happening in communityındews and close anymorenonevenet corpo and happened challenging those things and doing those things differently if you answer yes and feel you're in an abusive relationship it's important to take steps to repair the damage that's done to your self-worth self-confidence independence and ability to trust others recovering from emotional abuse starts with recognizing that the abuse took place rather than minimizing or denying it to yourself the next step is to start challenging those mental patterns that are linked to the abuse we just talked about those a lot of those self-degrading comments and statements now this can also include shifting negative thoughts and beliefs such as thinking the abuse was your fault that you will never be in a healthy relationship or that you could have done something different that would have prevented the abuse in addition healing from an emotionally abusive relationship involves honoring your own needs and desires by doing what you love and what makes you true and that's what I'm talking about here today this is the most important thing that you need to know about yourself you need to be aware of your own needs and desires by doing what

That I can do what I want, the rules don't apply to me, I'm better than everybody, I'm entitled and that becomes again a prime candidate. For criminal behavior. there's a narcissistic element that is being formed out of the deep shame and pain of complex trauma. Somebody has put it into kind of four categories. family related risk factors, that's what we've just described. All of the complex trauma that comes out of an abuse and neglect environment. Secondly, school related risk factors. a child that just doesn't achieve and do very in school or a child who's bullied or becomes a bullier, they are more prone to criminal behavior. And a child that just skips school a lot, doesn't care about school, they are more prone to fall into criminal behavior. Then that goes to community risk factors. a disadvantaged neighborhood, a very poor run-down neighborhood, not a whole lot of organizations within the community for the child to participate in, a community that's just neglected by the government and it's just run down. All kinds of garbage, disrepair happening, there's an availability of drugs, there's gangs that are happening, there's a high turnover within those communities, and there's no closeness in the communities, you just don't do things, in a way that's not good. you have to keep that in mind, as you're dealing with the problems. You don't want to just go back and forth and say oh, I'm , that's enough, that's enough, that's enough, that's enough, that's enough, that's enough, that's enough. There's no vulnerability to the community. things together. That sets up a child to be a higher risk for criminal behavior. And then the peer risk factors. And a child that doesn't feel connected at home then is prone to peer pressure and getting into gangs, etc. Hanging around with friends that are involved in criminal behavior, that condone criminal behavior, early involvement in criminal behavior, having all of their friends who've got problem behaviors, people that just aren't as smart and they just aren't thinking about a future, a career. They're just trying to survive."

The internet becomes their global weapon. They will be the first platform to broadcast their victimhood to an audience of strangers who will offer them sympathy and validate their twisted version of events. And at the heart of all this is the narcissist's masterpiece, the victim narrative. In this story, they are the selfless, loving parent who has been cruelly abandoned by a cold, ungrateful, and mentally unstable child. They will weep. They will lament. They will perform their grief and their affection. This performance is not only for others, it is for themselves. It is a vital psychological defense. By casting themselves as the ultimate victim, they can completely absolve themselves of any responsibility for the estrangement. It allows them to deny the decades of their own abuse and to project the role of the abuser onto the one person who finally had the courage to escape it. When the narrative isn't enough, the campaign often escalates to legal harassment. This can include filing false police reports for wellness checks designed to intimidate and embarrass. It can involve frivolous lawsuits or, most heinously, the weaponization of grandchildren in bitter custody battles. They will use the institutions of society the police, the courts, the social services as instruments of their personal vendetta all under the guise of concern. They will manipulate churches, schools, and community groups, leveraging their social standing to isolate the scapegoat and paint them as a pariah. Let's be clear about what this is. This is psychological warfare and the tactics are drawn from the same playbook used by cult leaders and totalitarian regimes. The goal is to isolate the dissident, control the flow of information, and destroy their credibility that no one will listen to them. It is an attempt at psychological endowment. It is an attempt at self-denial. And why. What drives this level of venomous desperation. Because the scapegoat's independent, healthy life is the single greatest threat to the narcissist's existence. Your happiness is proof that their narrative was a lie. Your success is a judgment on their failure as a parent. Your peace is a mirror that reflects their own internal chaos. They are not just angry. They are existentially threatened."

It often feels sadly. That a pet would be more important to him than his own daughter. The absent stranger can also be more connecting with a son, but not a daughter. That's another dynamic there. Here's the impact on a daughter the her inner child can assume that a father this just doesn't think you're maybe worth it enough, which actually wasn't true. The impact on her mental health is that she can have core beliefs that contribute to depression and anxiety that can often be about not feeling good enough and some shame. There can also be hyper vigilance about being forgotten. Or abandoned her sense of men can be men can become icky people to avoid as if they were aliens because they were aliens or that you have to work a million times more to convince a man to be interested in you, which is really too much on anyone to put in that amount of work the replication and projection dynamic a daughter here can get caught up in chasing being known by men. And since there wasn't protection a daughter can also project that their partner is aloof or disinterested over normal stuff."

But now, you make choices without the weight of their expectations. You get dressed without wondering if they'll approve. You speak freely without rehearsing. You reconnect with friends. You were told to stay away from. You pursue interests that were once mocked. And little by little, you take your life back. Not with fanfare, but with quiet defiance. You stop tiptoeing around your own potential. You start taking up space again, maybe awkwardly at first. You allow yourself to want things, dream about things, enjoy things without feeling guilty. You realize joy isn't selfish. You begin to see how much of your life was paused. Muted. Minimized. To make room for someone who only felt big when you felt small. And now, you refuse to keep living in a story that centers someone who tried to erase you. You write new chapters. You speak new truths. And for the first time in a long time, you feel your life expanding instead of shrinking. There's no grand announcement. You were in the summer of your life. Some of the warmest summer. Some of the warmest times are over. There's room for more growth. There's a new grand announcement. The phase of life that seems big. You realize there's no grand announcement. There's only the phase of summer to be mystic. To be mindful. To be meaningful. To be connected. There's no grand announcement. There's only the phase of summer. You don't need to post about it. You just start doing the things they told you couldn't. Maybe it's applying for the job they said you weren't smart enough for. Maybe it's traveling to the place they never let you go. Maybe it's laughing too loud, dressing too bold, or creating something that's purely yours."

They assume you'll eventually feel lonely, confused, or nostalgic enough to reach out. And until that day comes, they lie low. Quietly confident that they're still in control. They may even weaponize your silence against you. They'll say you're being dramatic. Immature. Cold. Coasted. Them. That you're the one who gave up. Why.

You'll come back when you calm down. many narcissists don't rush back in when you go no contact. It's not because they've moved on. It's because they're calculating. They want to see how long it takes before you crack. They want to know if the addiction they built is still alive inside you. And if you do reach out, even once, they'll see that as proof that you're still hooked. Not because you miss them. Not because you're healing. They believe they own a part of you. And now you've just confirmed it. They rely on time to work in their favor. They hope the initial anger wears off. That the emotional fog settles. That the version of them you remember becomes softer, more tolerable. They know how memory works and they use it."

In turn, I learned how narrow and arbitrary the window viewed as normal is. our cultures developed kind of this window of what we consider normal sexual behavior. And what she began to realize is that's quite narrow. And who made up those rules. It seems arbitrary. although the media bombard us with sexual imagery and titillation, we continue to be hard pressed to find and access reliable and useful sexuality information. The subject of sex still appears to be a point of shame or taboo or ignorance. Many of our clients struggle to understand. there's tons of sexual. Images and sexual titillation in our media. But there's not clear talk about sex to help people understand sex. And many of our clients really don't understand their sexuality very is the point.

This year has been the biggest year for me releasing traumatic stress from my physical system. I have a video coming out on Monday that talks about that, be sure to check it out. the patience that we have is just, we just have to do it,. And sometimes the patience is a little bit of tough love. It's the research shows if we don't heal this stuff, we will get sick most likely, even with all the healthy lifestyle practices, the ACE study, the adverse, childhood experiences study is too conclusive to not pay attention to this and not find the patience. you said the question is from Milika from Belgrade. You asked, I've heard that certain body parts can be in freeze while other body parts aren't. And to me, that's just fascinating. Yes, it is. how do we unfreeze those frozen body parts by feeling them fully and seeing what's there and letting whatever wants to come up and out as Irene says. For me, for example, it's the lower abdomen and my feet. here's, yes. yes, sometimes if we have an accident, one area will be more dissociated. Sometimes when we grow up in that kind of environment that's really unsafe, our immune system will freeze,. These are real stories. this is where, , we see kiddos that have allergies and immune related problems and troubles thinking and learning. Some of them, sometimes stress goes to the immune system. Sometimes it goes to the skin. Sometimes it goes to how we're thinking. Sometimes it goes to our emotions. And, but here's the thing. There's no one, , we're going to do trauma work. That's just related to this body part. Milika, it comes back to working with the whole system. And then when you become more tuned to how to listen to your system, and , for instance, that the freeze is more in your abdomen, you might use more intention, more touch, more movement. Maybe you will get some body work around the abdomen once how to track the physiology, same with the feet."

You only get what looks love if you earn it. Then if you earn love and they do something for you, what looks love, it's not really love. Now, basically, you're obligated to them. You're in their debt. You now owe them. They have something over you. love is actually sets up relationships where now you have to pay back. You keep score. You owe. They owe. It's always keeping calculations in your mind of who owes who. Another misconception about love for many people is that love is sex. And if you love somebody, then sex is how you show that to them. And that is very, very common. Another one is love equals pity. they can think of as a child, they didn't experience love. But if they saw a dog or a cat who was in pain, they would immediately feel pity for that empathy. And that felt love. And now when they feel empathy and pity for somebody who's hurting, they feel in love with that person."

They're too little to fight. They're too little to flee. there's no point in having cortisol. There's no point in having oxytocin because nobody cares. what the brain does. The brain then does is prepare itself to freeze. And what that means is the brain prepares itself to get hurt. And this is interesting to understand. Because if a child can't fight or flight, it must freeze. The brain then releases opioids, its own opioids in the system to prepare it to get hurt. the brain then does. It does that to prepare itself to get hurt. it won't feel it badly. But also what happens is the brain slows the heartbeat down. In fight or flight, cortisol sped the heartbeat up. But now on freeze, it slows it down, preparing it to get hurt. The child retreats into itself. It doesn't flee outwardly. It flees inwardly. Into its own fantasy. And the child goes to people pleasing. I'll do whatever you want. Just don't be angry. Don't hurt me. And that happens because of complex trauma. the only way then to regulate the emotions if it can't fight or flight and resolve it is let's release opioids to calm the child down. Let's dissociate. That'll regulate the child. Let's people please. That'll regulate the situation. it's still about regulation. what happens when they get to adult life and there's still nobody in their life that cares that's helping them and they're dysregulated. They need to release opioids in their body. And people will bang their heads against the wall. They will cut. That will release opioids in their body. They will burn themselves and that brings back the regulating feelings again. Or they find drugs and alcohol. They find opioid chemicals out there. And those help them feel regulated again. complex trauma sets people up for cutting, burning their own opioid system, for drugs, synthetic opioid systems. All to help them regulate. let's move on to healing. There's some very important healing phases. And we've talked about this in other talks in a lot of detail.

On this episode of Navigating Narcissism, I've invited the world's leading expert on betrayal, who has dedicated her life to finding the answer to this tormenting question. I can't remember the last time I was this excited to talk to someone. After decades of research, Dr. Jennifer Freid has coined the term betrayal blindness to describe our inability to recognize betrayal, especially when the perpetrator is someone or something we trust. For example, a parent who abuses a child, or a partner that cheats, or a church that hides abuse. If you have been listening to Navigating Narcissism for a while, you've heard me talk about Dr. Freid time and again. Her work is key to understanding what happens to survivors of narcissistic abuse. It is my honor to speak with the legendary Dr. Jennifer Freid. This podcast should not be used as a substitute for medical or mental health advice. Individuals are advised to use their own words to describe their own experiences. If you have any questions, please contact me at the address on the screen. I am Dr. Freid, and I will be your guide for you to seek medical advice, counseling, and or therapy from a healthcare professional with respect to any medical condition, mental health issue, or health inquiry, including matters discussed on this podcast. This episode discusses abuse, which may be triggering to some people. The views and opinions expressed are solely those of the podcast author, or individuals participating in the podcast, and do not represent the opinions of Red Table Talk Productions, iHeartMedia, or their employees. , first of all, Dr. Jennifer Freid, welcome. Every often we have a guest where, again, I'm a bit sort of starstruck, and this is one of those days. I've been reading your work throughout my career, and it's actually been really influential in shaping my work in the area of narcissistic abuse. , not only am I happy you're here, I'm deeply honored and a little bit awestruck. , welcome and thank you. , I'm delighted to be here. Thank you. Dr. Freid, I want to talk about what is betrayal. Everyone uses the word, but you have a really, really great comprehensive definition. What is it."

About 80 of people with little T trauma were very sensitive children. And that makes a lot of sense. their brother. Might not have been affected by dad. Getting angry. And yelling. And screaming every night. But their sensitive child. That was terrifying. And. The sensitive. Are very subject to the little T trauma. And the effects. What is neglect. if you remember. We talked about the 12 needs. That every person has built into them. Physical needs. Emotional needs. Intellectual needs. Relational needs. Spiritual needs. And then. The most sensitive. Is the child. That is. Very sensitive. To the little T trauma. And the effects. What is neglect."

I certainly think a lot of us can probably identify with the feelings of insignificance. , I'm just not important. Why would anyone care about me. My voice doesn't mean anything. My opinions. My opinions don't matter. Now, what about this exaggerated self-importance. I remember having a boss that I worked for in a hospital. And she grew up in an alcoholic, narcissistic home. And she would go around with exaggerated self-importance that wasn't based on anything. It didn't have any substance to it. And if you challenged it. She would just crumble. But she would have this exaggerated self-importance. And I think of it as kind of whistling past the cemetery. That I'm really afraid, but I'm going to whistle , oh, there's nothing wrong. There's nothing going on. And she would manage that. And of course it would irritate other people. But if you dare challenge it, she just folds. Or becomes vindictive. Because of how she would manage. Because of how she was abused growing up. Another weird mannerism that adult children of narcissists can have. Is never operating from their true self. Adults who grew up with narcissistic parents may struggle to identify or operate from their true self. As they often do not have a clear understanding of what it means. Their sense of identity may be overshadowed or suppressed. By the need to conform. And conform to parental expectations and demands. And then as we become an adult. Conform to the expectations and demands of others around us. Leaving them unsure of their own desires, benefits, and values. You may have some or all of these mannerisms. The good news is that there are fixes and recovery for all of them. Let me give you some self differentiation tips. First of all, remember these mannerisms are not the real you. Don't forget that. They are what you have been programmed to have. They're the family Wi-Fi. They come from all of the experiences growing up in a narcissistic home. Second of all, learn to detach from the family super self. In other words. A family that's dysfunctional has one big super self. That everybody partakes of. They don't have selves."

And I'll be defining those experiences because I do believe that the different types of experiences common to FSA survivors, and these are research-based, I didn't just pull these up out of the air, or make them up, or, oh, it happened to me, it must be happening to everybody. I have been doing various types of qualitative, that means someone's lived experience. Sometimes we call that feminological research, qualitative research. And that is what supported my introductory guide on family scapegoating abuse when I introduced the term. let's get to the 16 experiences common to survivors of family scapegoating abuse. Number one, you may identify as being codependent or highly sensitive and empathic. You may have the fawn submit response to avoid conflict or people pleasing. Alternatively, you may have no problem setting boundaries and will defend yourself without hesitation if you feel you are being disrespected or violated in some manner. And when I say response, I'm talking about trauma responses. I saw all of the trauma responses within the. Not only my work with clients, but in my FSA research. Two, you may have difficulty expressing your feelings because at a very young age, you learn to be careful about revealing too much of yourself as it would be used against you by family members. You may have been told by a parent or other family member that you are cold, unloving, insensitive, too sensitive, heartless, and on.

That's, I find, sometimes super clarifying and helpful to people who are trying to make sense out of what's happening is where there's double standards. But the main thing I tend to want to emphasize to someone is if you're afraid, assume that there's a problem. Don't assume that, oh, I'm just getting afraid for no reason. Maybe you're just getting afraid for no reason. I doubt it. But even if you are, it's it's too risky in case it's not for no reason. You've got to take it seriously. Actually, let me add one more thing, which is that a guy who's not abusive, if you say you really scared me, he's concerned about that. He's going to say, oh, geez, all , what do we need to change. And even if he feels he didn't do anything wrong, he's still going to want to know, , what was it. I'm going to learn this about you. , maybe I wasn't misbehaving. But now I've learned that there is a thing that I do sometimes that scares you. He'd want to know about that. He doesn't want her to be afraid. And if he says you scared me and his response is, , da, da, da, da, that's an abuser for sure. If you're having intuition, instinct that you're afraid of him, all things being equal, is it worth the risk to stay or is it not worth the risk. Because statistically it's a risk. Is it worth putting me, me and my kids, in danger to stay or not. , we know what the answer is. Whether you choose that or not is a different story. There also are sort of a series of levels to take distance in a relationship because people will think , , I'm not ready to leave this relationship, I'm going to leave it the way it is. It's , , there's other things. You can leave for a week. You can leave for a month."

Do not give that meaning other than at the most basic level. I am in a depressive episode. I am experiencing anhedonia and I'm unable to feel those connections now. Do not interpret that as I have fallen out of love with my wife and I should get divorced and try to find someone I actually love.

I know, I know it's not as simple as snap your fingers, flip the switch in your brain, stop doing it. But you do have to start with just the basic knowledge that my emotions are not always trustworthy. Because they don't always correlate with what's actually present in my life. And therefore, I cannot make them the sole decision makers in my life and in my future. Because they will lead me horribly astray at times when they lose connection with the outer world. Not saying become a robot and make everything a spreadsheet. Because that has downsides. I've kind of tried that. The way things look on paper and the way they actually play out, not always the same thing. But don't let your emotions be the sole reason you do things. I really don't think anyone should do that, honestly. But definitely don't do it if you have a mental illness. Because your emotions can be a little out of touch with your actual life sometimes.

Sadly, it can become the case, that ongoing contact with the narcissistic family system can be quite harmful. And that by the time a person goes no contact with a narcissistic family system, that they have suffered and suffered, and hoped and hoped, and tried and tried, and had those hopes dashed, and tried, and blamed themselves, and radical acceptance, then often becomes the catalyst to no contact. It is a, big decision to make. Because to go no contact can upend a family system. Because it is all but impossible to go no contact with just one family member. Especially a family that has, that's connected to each other. Oftentimes going no contact means you lose everyone. And not everyone wants that. But the assumption that the person who makes the decision to go no contact, is simply a petulant adult baby person, is wrong. I've worked with clients in a range of situations. Some of them have gone no contact with selected family members, and sometimes with entire family systems for years. And there was grief, and a sense of loss, but ultimately a sense of peace. Not one of them regretted it. They definitely regretted that this was their lot, that this was their story. But they didn't regret the decision that they made. Others couldn't go no contact for a range of reasons. Culture, a close attachment to other family members that they would lose if they went no contact with anyone. Fear. And they found themselves on a revolving carousel of ongoing abuse, that they would often attempt to do work arounds on. None of them came to these decisions lightly. And many of the ones who could not do no contact, often wished they could, and recognized very clearly how much easier their lives, and how much better their overall health would be, if they did not have to maintain contact. Now obviously, narcissism and other forms of antagonistic personality styles in family members, are not the only reason that people go no contact."

        "value": "Without further ado, 10 reasons why people with complex PTSD might lie. Reason one, you are having a fawn response. This is probably, in my opinion, one of the biggest reasons why people lie without knowing they're lying. in Pete Walker's book, he walks you through what a fawn response is. It is part of what he calls the four Fs. when your sympathetic nervous system is activated because you perceive yourself to be in danger, we commonly think of going into either fight or flight mode. He argues we go into either fight, flight, freeze, or fawn responses. And when we are fawning, what we are doing is essentially doing some version of what you might otherwise think of as people pleasing. temporarily shutting down your body and your mind to your own desires and needs and focusing on giving the person in front of you what they want because your body is in fear and your body assumes that if you can give the person what they want, then they will not harm you. Now, the fawn response is a very common one. The fawn response is a very complex psychological phenomenon that I'm actually going to film a whole other video unpacking. when that video comes out, I will link it in the description of this video. But essentially what you need to know about the fawn response is that when you are doing this, when you are going along with what someone else wants, when you are people pleasing, when you are deciding that the easiest way forward is to go with the flow and be easygoing, often you are not overtly lying in the way that we tend to think about people. You are not sitting there with this burning personal desire that you're refusing to disclose. What you're actually doing is thinking, , I have a list of 10 things at any given point in time that I want. And now, the thing on the top of the list is harmony because I feel threatened. And even that is often not the most conscious thought process. What you might be feeling in that moment is I don't really have a preference. What you might be feeling in that moment is I don't have a preference. I don't have a preference. I don't have a preference. I don't have a preference."

Here are some brief recap issues about shame. Here are some shame mechanisms and concepts to help further understand shame. Again, you might think you understand shame, but most people don't really understand. Shame versus guilt. In my experience, guilt is a gnawing feeling about being unable to remedy a situation or feeling you're failing others somehow, where shame automatically tells us we're inherently bad or a failure or not good enough. Childhood trauma coming from having abusive parents can involve what I call direct and indirect shame. Direct shame is we're being told that finger in our face, you're a bad kid. I can't believe you just did that. You're bad in various ways. Where indirect shame can be about feeling embarrassed about something a parent does or their character or the type of house that you grew up in because it's chaotic or messy. I did a video on this topic of direct and indirect shame that I'll put in the description for you. Another concept is full of shame or shameless. Childhood trauma greatly influences our shame, either acutely elevating it or we can really repress it greatly. Both have unwanted consequences in our lives and social life. we can't really repress it. We can't really repress it. We can't really find an extent to our public us. And put thatцевail because that's an everending nightmare. When we become aware that we are living in a Extra Time situation. There's a question that we definitely must correct, and that's, is it easy to fight off theson, type of shame. One of my favorite concepts to describe shame is shame being a fixed gravity thing. And a good analogy about shame is that shame is the main human emotion that other emotions orbit around, the sun and the solar system. It's the main entree to the emotional buffet here. For example, you might feel intense shame if something sad happens to you, but you quickly start to compare your situation that you're sad about to maybe someone who has it worse. That's kind of a stuck thing with childhood trauma."

But is this part of the answer to how people get better at self-regulation. Because the self-regulation aspect of it I think is a huge part of disorganized attachment for people. They just have a very difficult time regulating their internal experience. I think that what you talked about earlier, about just letting it all out, can actually be in the service of self-regulation ultimately. Because you really pop the lid, you get the feelings out, you find after you finally say the thing, or you finally have the emotion or whatever it is. It actually gets a lot easier to be with your internal world after that. But if there's anything else you would to add to that piece of it, the more self-regulation aspect, I would love to hear. Thanks for that. Take care of your body. That's really important because often, how high ACEs score predispose people to chronic health problems. ACEs being adverse child experiences. And it's not at all in common that a person, for example, has some kind of chronic reactivity to fill in the blank. Take care of your body. Protein with every meal. Be careful about stuff that's dysregulating physiology. Eat. Get some exercise. Have daily routines. These things really, really help protect your body. Get sleep if you can. Protect your body. The last thing I'll just toss in here is one of the most regulating things of all is love flowing through us. Truth. And there can be this feeling, depending on attachment experiences, particularly in disorganization, disorganized attachment, that somehow we're broken, tainted, spoiled, irredeemable, completely destroyed. No. The innate lovingness that comes up from the of being in your own depths is undestructible, indestructible. And as it flows through you, it will organize you and kind of regulate you and focus you along the way, including as it flows out into the world. Whether it's your cat, your neighbor, your friend, your tomato plant, loving flowing through you will organize you. And also it tends to create the best odds of good treatment from others. Acts of creation in general, I think, are another great example of that."

And real fast, if you're watching my videos and wondering if maybe past trauma is having an effect on your life today, I want to share with you a list of signs that what you're struggling with now might be connected with neglect or abuse in your childhood. It's good to know this because it can help that what's hard for you now is normal and that healing is possible. You can download my signs of childhood PTSD quiz by clicking the top link in the description section below or using that QR code there. Believe it. Don't go into detective mode. Don't get curious about their trauma and try to explain it away. Don't try to fix them or make them read a book or go to therapy. That's not your job. You just met them. That's not love, by the way. That's codependency. you don't need to slam the door or make a dramatic exit or yell at them. You can just leave. You can block their number. You can move on. You can write your fears and resentments, then meditate and get re-regulated. And then you can begin to do the work to choose differently next time. And this is what it means to live someone who's healing. You're not waiting to be rescued. You're not begging to be chosen. You're not hanging on for dear life to somebody who's just making you miserable. You're watching. You're listening. And you're choosing. And when the signs are there, when your gut says no, you run. Does the fear of abandonment or of being alone cause you to stay in negative relationships."

When you get to a psychopath or a social path, they've got the most shame of anybody in the world. But they are totally shut down about that. the greater the shame, the greater the mental health problems. And that's because the brain has to do greater and greater things that are bizarre to try and survive with that much shame. And then the final result, and this is important to understand, is do you realize the more shame you have, the more people can manipulate you. Do you realize that your mom might be able to manipulate you to do whatever you want, she wants you to do, but if you had zero shame, your mom couldn't manipulate you at all. If you had zero shame, your mom couldn't manipulate you at all. It's your shame that makes you vulnerable to being manipulated. just think about that.

that I think this whole sense of course I found this person they're just my mother I said no you didn't go out looking for this I don't buy the masochist theory what I buy is that the narcissistic people are often super smart confident charming charismatic attractive put together they're the they're at often time the archetype of what look good looks good on paper or they just manage to mesh with some sort of core wound you have they pick out that thing and they know to just compliment you on it or say you gosh your family told you're not that smart I think you're smart it doesn't have to be that way it's just a matter of how you deal with it doesn't have to be a dozen roses it can just be that healing or temporary healing it feels of a core wound because of that in the in I think everyone's attracted to a narcissistic person what I always say to folks is if you came from a narcissistic family of origin or had a narcissistic parent it's not that you're more likely to draw a narcissistic person or be attracted to them it's that you're more likely to get stuck in the relationship because it's normalized you're you're oh you have to chase love and no one's ever gonna love me unconditionally there's that interesting feel but we do make the mistake Tamsen of I think one of the big mistakes I see out there on social media is that we only talk about the grandiose form of narcissism the charming charismatic arrogant the obvious but there's different subtypes of narcissism and that's why some people you said I don't even know the word or I didn't think this applied there are because of there are these different kinds of narcissism there are people out there in very toxic narcissistic relationships but because it doesn't sort of conform to this charming charismatic kind of narcissism we miss it I think that this isn't as simple as somebody walking around bragging about themselves arrogant it can be but it's not always Dr Armani can we go through what are some of those other kind of stereotypes we know what to look for because I want people at the end of this to know how to define it know what to look for and if they do spot that they're in that type of relationship to at least be able to acknowledge it find that vocabulary that not all of us have had and figure out a way to get out or get help one thing I want to make clear is number one it's not an either or a person it's not that a person's narcissistic or not it's not black or white narcissism thing first of all narcissism is on a continuum and frankly at the mild end it feels more an emotionally stunted emotionally immature superficial almost ridiculous person it's the 50 year old person who still wants to play their video games and throw a tantrum when you ask them to empty the dishwasher that is a milder narcissism and some people say I would have loved better but I don't feel I'm psychologically unsafe I'm annoyed when we get to the severe end of narcissism though Tamsin it can be downright dangerous these are people who might isolate a partner take a tremendous advantage of them financially abuse them there might even be physical abuse the manipulation is at a very high level and it can feel very hard to escape most people and in fact my book it's not used really written about that moderate part it doesn't look a sort of a terrifying story nor is it just somebody who won't empty the dishwasher it's definitely taking a psychological toll on people that's the whole spectrum of it but within that spectrum there are also subtypes our kind of dictionary definition of narcissism is that grandiose sort of swagger narcissist but there's also a form of narcissism it's called vulnerable narcissism some people call it covert narcissism it doesn't show up as narcissism it shows up as sort of an angry aggrieved sullen passive-aggressive why don't I get my chance I feel everyone's taking advantage of me nothing is fair to me that it doesn't show up as narcissism and their partners are always they kind of feel bad for them nothing is going their way sometimes it's pity is harder to leave in a way because you're gosh this relationship is exhausting and they blame me for everything because that's a key thing in narcissism is they blame the other person nothing's ever their responsibility there's no accountability and then when we use this term covert narcissism I would argue that all narcissism is covert and by what I mean by that is it doesn't show up when other people are around you're at the dinner party and a lot of people think you're either with this really smart person or interesting person or put together person or just clever person but as soon as you get out of that circumstance they're really cruel to you but then there's no one witnessing this but the vulnerable narcissism has more of a negative effect on you and you're not going to be able to just be able to keep looking at this and now that I'm saying that I'll let what it is that's going on maybe it's something that's more of a socially anxious hostile angry thin-skinned kind of a feel then there's malignant narcissism which is that more severe narcissism which is coercive and manipulative and exploitative and scary that's a dangerous that's all the way to the end and then there's forms of narcissism that I don't think we talk about enough that come up a lot and one of them is what we call communal narcissism and communal by being perceived as do-gooders and rescuers."

One of the things that you said in the first episode that we did with you was you made a distinction between somebody who's annoying and that's someone with an inflated ego versus somebody who is narcissistic, who is harmful. , that's it. It's the harmful part."

        "value": "Not because time is cruel, but because the truth, when denied long enough, eventually demands payment, and it never comes cheap. You see, narcissism doesn't age wisdom. It doesn't grow softer or more tempered with experience. Instead it rots. It corrodes the soul from the inside out. Especially when it's not there. Especially when no real self ever existed beneath the mask. The mask, you understand, is a fragile thing. Eid, it's a carefully constructed illusion. A fortress built on insecurity, fear, and denial. And over time, when life's inevitable hardships strip away the external validations, the looks, the status, the power, that mask begins to crumble. What remains is not strength, but vulnerability. Not growth, but decay. The narcissist's world collapses because it was never built on truth. It was built on falsades. And the longer they cling to those falsades, the more devastating the fall becomes. This is not just a decline. It is a unraveling. And yet, here's the critical point. If you love someone this, if you see these signs in someone close to you, understand this decay isn't your fault. It's not a punishment you must bear, or a failing you caused. You're not alone. You're not alone. You are a psychological wound. A sickness of the spirit that can isolate and devastate those around it as much as the person who carries it. But knowledge is power. Seeing the signs. The isolation. The obsession with the past. The victimhood. The rage. The collapse. Means you're no longer blind to the truth. You're equipped to protect yourself. To set boundaries and to seek healing where healing is possible. And for the narcissists themselves. If they are willing to look inward. It is never too late to begin the difficult work of self-examination and transformation. But that requires courage, humility and a willingness to face a truth that most find unbearable, that the mask must fall for the real self to emerge. recognize the unraveling but do not despair, because from truth comes the possibility of redemption. And without truth, there is only endless decay."

with people you can then start having panic attacks that come out of nowhere some go to either constipation or diarrhea it just throws off their whole gastrointestinal system some insomnia or they just want to sleep all the time some they get startled really easily the slightest little thing and they jump others find their blood pressure goes up or they have a racing heartbeat others all of a sudden you get you get a little bit of a panic attack and then you can just be sweating a lot way more than normal you get aches and pains you get muscle tension you get inflammation all of a sudden that happens or you get migraines headaches that you don't normally get or you're just tired all the time you can sleep all the time or you can't sleep at all but you're tired all the time those are some of the physical symptoms that can happen after you realize you've been betrayed that leads to behavioral symptoms that often happen with people that have been Freshly betrayed I just want to isolate from people I can't face anybody I don't want to have to explain I don't want to have to talk I'm going to isolate and then crying frequently just can't stop crying decreasing self-care don't take care of yourself don't shower don't eat properly don't sleep properly all of that can happen don't do the things that you used to do as healthy self-care or escapes healthy hobbies you just can't work as much and there's a decrease in your work productivity there's an increase or decrease in your eating we've talked about that for some there's an increase in aggressiveness in reactivity the person says the slightest little thing to you and you go into attack mode and you lash out that can happen others just spend all their time on social media that just numbs them out they just scroll through page after page of social media others go into just buying stuff and they make all kinds of unnecessary purchases it's a way of numbing it's a way of getting out of that pain for a while others go to alcohol and drugs it's a way of numbing it's a way of getting out of the pain some go to reckless behavior they drive radically they all of a sudden do stuff that potentially is quite risky they could die but part of them doesn't care if I die I die and they're increased there's an increase in risky behavior then there's relationships symptoms that come out of it and they're more long term for people they have been betrayed now they are looking at starting a relationship again just a friendship it's not necessarily romantic could be but it's not necessarily but all of a sudden they find that they're struggling to open up they're struggling with any kind of deeper intimacy that just scares them they can even be suspicious of kindness somebody's super kind to them and they go are they grooming me is there what do they want is there a hidden agenda here and they have huge trust issues they don't know if they can ever trust again they're suspicious of everything and then if they do get in a relationship they have difficulty maintaining that relationship every little thing the person does they overanalyze they look for negative they find the betrayal they pull away they test the other person and they're they have difficulty maintain relationships and then if the other person is wanting to get closer and get to know them better they're not comfortable with that they're kind of resisting that or pushing people away and then they can have Jealousy issues they start to get in a relationship and every time that belongs that person talks to somebody else they're I give them an insult anyway but the reason why more love is to get in that relationship and this has said a lot at least for some times the relationship and then another one of these relationships often are not focused that way they're just five two three or five هنا it's hard to run and tell guys and their correspondents can around them just it's hard to keep your Benson rods and get out of prison the person that does the other person and they know that tied off fighting real estate and this is cum star smell all white and it stirs up stuff and they get super jealous and that can cause trouble and then they can have all have a odd oppositional defiance they get in a relationship and the person says i think you should do this or here's what i think we should do and it's almost something is triggered inside of them that i want to do the opposite i am not going to follow anybody's advice i'm not going to trust anybody's advice i have to make all my decisions by myself then for some now when they get in a relationship to them if i'm not going to be betrayed by you and i'm going to be able to trust you then we there can be no boundaries you can never say no to me you can never say you need some personal space and they resist boundaries and boundaries to them proves you aren't loyal you don't love me you don't care."

Then to your face, they project everything. you are confronting them and saying, why are you treating me this. Why are you cheating. What's wrong with me. And they, at first, might not answer you. They give you the silent treatment. But then they might say, you want to know. It's because you're this way, you're this way, you're this way. And they project all of the problems onto you. It's all your fault. They accuse you of stuff you've never even dreamed of doing. And often it's because they're already doing it themselves. But they're accusing you of what they are doing but making it sound you're the one doing it. that's the projection that they do. And then they start this damage control. they put stuff on Facebook about how terrible you are and they put pictures of this new person they're with and everybody's happy. Everybody's happy. And it makes them look the hero again. And they're doing damage control on their image. that's the three parts of the cycle. Now I want to dig into this discard stage a little bit. Because many of you have been there and that it is a very, very difficult thing. I want to come in at two angles. if you are the one that a narcissist discards, and you get a third one, what would you do. they get rid of you. Usually it's very sudden. It's flipping a switch. One day we're done. They say that we're done and they're gone. And usually they move very quickly in with somebody else. It's one relationship to another. They're not ending it with you until they got somebody else set up. that's what begins to happen."

What do you think about the role of courage in life. , we've talked far about the balance of doing it but not doing it. We've talked about dreaming big and maybe dreaming even further. And then we've also had this idea of a little bit of relinquishing of control as we've got to apply the effort, we've got to have the vision, but we've also got to know when we're going to let go a little bit. It seems to me courage, the ability to feel our convictions and commit to them is a little bit of a common thread that sort of runs through those. I grew up only knowing sort of the courage of the persistence. Be resilient, endure, get up, dust yourself off, go. The problem with that, the Achilles heel with that is if you get up and get the courage to keep on going every time and get up and dust yourself off, you make the same mistakes each time around because you never backed up. To have what I've now learned and still learning is that. The courage to go, no, I'm going to let some people pass me in the race now because I'm going to look at why I keep stepping in that damn same pothole and twist my ankle, the same spot. Why I keep failing when I try to get that next spot in this relationship or failing in this place to get this product of my craft to the next level. Would that be the relinquishing of the rom-com era in a small part for you. Small part,. , that was one. It also has to do with when I got married. My son comes to me at four years old and says, why isn't my mama kind of, hey, I'm going to go ahead. You're fucking four, dude. I sat there. I was , did your mom put you up this. Great question.

Others, I then say, What color is your drawing done in. And you realize that about 95 of the time the people say it's black and white. There's no color in their shame drawing of themselves. And that to me is significant because it's almost to their mind that shame takes the color out of life. And it makes it a very dull color where you live in a black and white. It makes it a very low color where you live in a black and white because it's black and white. And it makes it a very low color where you live in a black and white. white, pleasureless world when you have shame. Another characteristic of people with shame, and I will sometimes ask this, is are you able to look yourself in the eye when you look in the mirror. And many people with shame are not able to look at themselves in the eye when they look in the mirror. Some don't even look in a mirror because they can't stand to do that. Others, when they look in the mirror, never look at themselves in the eye. They either look at themselves from the nose down or from the eyebrows up because that is what shame does. You don't yourself because you feel you don't have value. You don't feel good enough. therefore, you don't yourself. , now I take clients to this. Every child at a subconscious level comes into the world asking, certain questions. Number one, who am I. What is my personality. What am I good at. And then, am I lovable. Do I have any value. Do people want to be with me. Do people me. What do I have to offer that would make people interested in me. they are asking those questions at a subconscious level. And then it's not just do people love me, but do they desire me. Do they, when they look at me, not just love me out of obligation, but do they, do their eyes light up and they get excited about spending time with me."

And then with a controlling type narcissistic mother, you weren't allowed to set boundaries. You weren't allowed to voice your opinion. And you struggle now with all of that.

And it's called that fork in the road. down one road at the fork in the roads, it is, just relapse. And you go, no, I know where that road ends up. And then the other fork in the road, says I got to do hard work. , I don't that option either. Is there a third road somewhere you're not telling me about. But that's where you're stuck. And you can sit at that fork in the roads for a while."

In a codependent relationship, sometimes the person with codependency will just shut down. They don't know what to do this time. , they will shut down. They will wall off. And this is kind of similar to flee when a lot of times, people with codependency are thinking that the other person will come pursue them. But when they're in that freeze mode, they're shutting down and sometimes they just wall off because they're recognizing that this relationship is exhausting and they're terrified to let it go. And thinking of addiction. When somebody is thinking about going into treatment, they get to the point where they're sick and tired of being sick and tired, but they don't know how to stop. They don't have the tools to deal with life on life's terms because they got a lot of stuff that they don't know. They don't know what they got to deal with. , they just freeze kind of a deer in headlights going, oh crap, what do I do. How do I get out of this. The relationship, the codependent relationship often comforts and numbs that abandonment anxiety. If the person in the codependent relationship feels confident that the other person needs them, that the other person can't live without them, then, it helps them feel less anxious because they feel they've got that parental figure, caregiver figure that they never had that they can call on. They're never going to be alone. The relationship becomes the primary focus and they start minimizing, denying, and blaming other people to protect the relationship. They start making excuses for the other, and they start making excuses for the person's behavior, whether it's because they're calling in sick or they've spent through their kid's college account or they didn't show up to their kid's soccer game. Whatever it is that person is doing as a result of whatever's going on with them, their depression, their anxiety, their addiction."

Because if they see the real me, they will abandon me. priority number one in my life must be to hide the real me. But the second priority is I don't want to be abandoned. The third priority is I don't want to walk around feeling I'm a nobody. I have to somehow compensate for that feeling that I at least feel I have some value. And then from that comes two other priorities. Though I feel I'm not lovable and though I feel I'm not valuable, I long to be loved. And I long to be respected or to have people treat me as if I have value. here's what begins to happen. I want love and respect, but I must stay hidden. how can I get love and respect without people getting to know the real me. And that becomes the challenge for the brain with a person with shame. And what I want to do tonight is develop that for you that you begin to see what the brain is trying to solve, what solutions it comes up with, and then I want to go into the next part of the lesson. I want to go into some of the ramifications of the solutions the brain comes up with. the brain develops solutions that it thinks are going to fix the problem, but it's limbic brain stuff. It just makes things feel a little bit better, but it makes things worse in the long run. here are some of the very early adaptations or solutions the brain proposes for the shame thing, how to get love and respect but remain hidden. number one, never be vulnerable. Never be authentic. Never let people see the parts of you that would make you weak. don't let them see you cry because then they might look down on you. Don't let them see you sad because then they might think less of you. now you have to hide those weak emotions, not just your personality, but those emotions that can creep out, and then once they're out, people might think less of you."

Then there's children who go through medical trauma, diagnosed with cancer or severe diseases, afraid that they might die, and living in hospitals and all of those kind of conditions for them. And then there's traumatic grief, when somebody dies who's very close to you, and the trauma that creates. And then there's abuse, and there's abuse that is sexual, physical, verbal, emotional. We talk about parents who have a mental health disorder, that they're not able to parent you in the way that you need. What I found interesting in going back through some of the latest research, is that they're now saying that the biggest cause of complex trauma in the Western world is neglect. parents meet your physical, mental needs, but they're not there for you emotionally. And you feel that they're in the same room, but they're not really present. And that kind of neglect makes a child feel all alone. They feel abandoned. And those are some of the different types of trauma that a child can experience. Now I want to talk about just some perspectives, that I've been thinking about, that might help you in your processing of understanding complex trauma in your own life. the first thing I want you to understand is this. Complex trauma means that a child had to move from being healthy in the way they lived, and had to adapt to a different type of behavior in order to survive. That is a key piece to understand. let me, let me present it this way. I don't know if you've thought about it, but children for the most part, when they come into the world, they have good instincts built into them. A child, they want to connect with their caregivers, with their siblings. They want to be authentic and express their personality openly. They want to open up and tell you what's happening inside of them. They want to cry, and express the emotions that they're feeling."

The overindulgence, they're being spoiled, always getting their way, and being coddled and over attended to by the narcissistic parent, for a lifetime, can result in a very entitled, arrogant, kind of mean to their siblings, grandiose and completely dysregulated adult. Either they expect the other people in the world to keep treating them their narcissistic parent treats them, or they internalize that message that they are just special, that they don't have to have any tolerance, for a moment, where they're anything but special. At that point, then it's all the golden rules of narcissism in play. It doesn't really change, you can never win, et cetera. the drill. When the golden child turns into an adult narcissist, they are typically gonna be more often the grandiose narcissist than anything else, and then the rest of the story if they're narcissistic. But there's another rather difficult side for the golden child, which is the narcissistic side. They're the path that the golden child, or golden children, may find themselves on. And that could sometimes be tremendous guilt. If a golden child temperamentally comes into the world as a nice child, a child that has empathy, and a decent heart, they will sense the differential treatment they're receiving, and they may actually feel very guilty about it, even at a very young age. They may keep trying to draw their other siblings in to get the special things that they get, or guide the narcissistic parent who favors them to also see the virtues in their other parent or in their siblings. It's as though that golden child is placed in the uncomfortable role of being some sort of a special envoy who has special access to the narcissistic parent, and they think maybe this parent who just is all about me will listen to me. It's a really unfair position to put any child in. And it gets really painful at that point, because the narcissistic parent often ain't gonna buy it. They'll say things , come on now, do we really wanna bring your brother along on this errand. He's gonna slow us down, and he's such a pain in the ass."

They might actually try to make the bad stuff happen just to get on with the good stuff. they've now got a reward system built into the cycle. And the person that gives the reward is the person that's abusing them. But they look forward to the reward. That makes them feel very connected. And they're very much connected to this person. It's interesting to me to see the similarities here between Stockholm Syndrome. Stockholm Syndrome came because of bank robbery and people that were taken captive as part of the bank robbery. And what they found is after these captives after a while began to feel, identify with their captors. They began to feel affection for them, loyal to them. And they go, what. What just happened here. These people are holding them, kidnapping them, holding them hostage. And now they them. Now they have affection for them. What happened there. And what psychologists believe is that when they were first captured, they were made to feel that they could lose their life. their fear went to the max. They were in a super traumatized place. Then when the captors decide not to kill them, they just feel this huge relief, which floods them with all the chemicals. They even feel now gratitude to their captors for letting them stay alive. And all of those chemicals going on in their brain now cause them to feel affection to listen to their captors to identify with their captors. And trauma bonding happens within this Stockholm syndrome. It's very -. syndrome. It's part of it. But what I want you to see is it goes beyond that. Now there's a fourth element to trauma bonding, and that's that intermittent. you go through the cycle, the good time's coming, you're just not sure when. you don't know when the reward's going to come, but it's sporadic, you can't predict it. And you don't know when they're going to switch from Jekyll to Hyde, that's unpredictable as , but it's going to happen. And what we know from addiction is that one of the hardest types of addictions to deal with is where the reward is intermittent."

You make demands. They make demands on people close to you of their time and energy. Some even explode with those closest to them.

You don't have to be going through something intense and traumatic to need comfort. People need comfort on a day-to-day basis. They need comfort for being a little bit tired. They need comfort for having a little bit of stress at work. They need comfort for having a bit of a tense situation with someone they're close with and having difficulty feeling settled in that relationship until they figure out what's going on. People need a reasonable amount of comfort every single day. And especially when you are going through some sort of stress, needing comfort is a normal experience to have. And the reason I want to emphasize that is because if you sat down as someone with complex PTSD and looked at the intensity of the stress, the intense matrix of all of the challenges and struggles and practical and interpersonal difficulties that you probably have in your life as a product of having complex PTSD, you would recognize that if you dropped a secure person into that, they would be almost overwhelmed by a need for comfort. the fact that you are feeling distressed and dysregulated is not weird and it's not because you're a bad, shameful person who can't cope with anything. If you have a very difficult life, you have a very high need for comfort. And if you're unable to recognize that need for comfort, the natural response is dysregulation of the system. if you can at step one, that point where you're feeling stressed and overwhelmed by either one or a complex matrix of problems in your life, if you can recognize and give yourself validation around the fact that it's normal to be wanting comfort at this point, that might be the first step in getting less dysregulated around all of these problems. If you can look at the fact that you can't make rent next month, or the fact that you have a giant pile of overdue bills, or the fact that you have relationships that are in disarray, or the fact that you're really struggling to keep up with your educational commitments as problems that naturally require comfort and support, that might not solve the problem, but it legitimizes the problem."

And the children get neglected because the narcissist is all wrapped up pursuing their selfish endeavors. The children get abandoned or abused if they don't cooperate with the narcissist. , children don't living that. That's painful. children in their own mind are trying to solve the family problems that arise when a narcissist is the sun within the family system. And children will adopt different roles to try to fix the family and to try to make the narcissist happy. And each child will try different things as a way to solve their family problems and to try to get the narcissist to meet their needs and validate them and not neglect them or abuse them. that's where you get the child that says, I'll be a hero. I will be the perfect child. I will never cause problems. I will do extra chores. I will get straight A's at school. I will never get a fighter in trouble. I will do all kinds of things extra around the house just to make everything run smoothly. Trying to solve the problem. Then you get the comedian child who says, there's a whole lot of pain in this family. The way to solve it is to be funny and laughing all the time. I'll be the jokester, the comedian, the storyteller, and I'll make everybody happy. And that'll fix our family. And then the invisible child says, I'll have no needs. I will fade into the background. I'll never ask for anything. I'll hide out in my room that I don't add any extra stress to this family because it is not in a good place. each child can try different ones. They can try all three. Most will settle in on one. But what they're going to find as they get older is it didn't fix the thing. The narcissist wasn't happy. The narcissist didn't meet their needs. The narcissist didn't validate them. And they took it personally and developed their own shame and said, it's my fault. I'm the problem. And that creates the next generation of codependent people. , that's how it begins."

It may happen because they saw their friend was sharing a new success on social media. It may happen because someone insulted them. , as you can see, all of these are experiences that may reveal the vulnerabilities or deficiencies of the narcissists to the world. And those are the kinds of things that trigger the shame cycle. , you can also see how shame sets off rage sets off shame sets off rage. , without understanding it, most people in these relationships live in confusion, walk on the proverbial eggshells, and hope to goodness that things go. But that would only work if you're the only person in the narcissist's life. The narcissistic person likely goes to work, or goes to the store, or is on social media, or goes to a social gathering, and something might happen there. And then, when they get back to you, they just spread that rage towards you, because they need a target. Now when experiences occur in the narcissist's life that uncover their deficiencies, the cycle is typically then to rage at other people, blame other people, become vindictive towards other people, and then feel more shame when people push back on their bad behavior for generally being a raging jerk. what are you supposed to do if you're in a relationship with a narcissist. Honestly, not much."

Some, when they're in shame, can become very impulsive and make rash decisions. Some relapse. And what I said at the very beginning is this. I've never seen anybody stay clean and sober if they don't deal with shame. Because shame will ultimately, over a period of years, train you that the only way to deal with your shame is to drink or use and numb it out. if you think of your drinking and using, for many of you, it was a solution to shame. You didn't feel you belonged, you drank, and you felt you were part of the group. You felt socially awkward and shy, you drank, to be the life of the party. You were trying to solve your shame with drugs and alcohol. And your brain will still want to go back there today. And that's important to be aware of. , self-awareness. you can take that home. You can kind of map out your main shame triggers. And then you can see what you do in your thinking, emotions, and actions once your shame is triggered. And I don't give you this just you can say, now I know all of this about myself. No, I tell you this that now, once your shame is triggered, and all of a sudden you realize you're getting down on yourself, and you're starting to beat yourself up, you can go, stop that. And you can catch yourself before it progresses. Or you feel yourself saying, I can't face people, I'm going to isolate. You go, no, I'm going to force myself to go with friends that I know are safe, and I'm not going to give in to this shame impulse. this self-awareness is you can catch yourself before your shame gets too bad, and then it leads to a relapse. that might not have felt a pick-me-up, let's heal from shame solution. Next week's the pick-me-up. This week is, shame is becoming aware of shame. Healing from shame is becoming aware of shame I can stop my shame patterns."

Because I've seen it once, I've seen it periodically. I just have to try a little bit longer, my luck's going to change. that intermittent piece is huge. somebody said this, trauma bonding happens, specifically because an abuser provides you with intermittent rewards and punishments. In doing , a psychological conditioning takes place whereby the survivor becomes entangled in the relationship, always hoping to return to when it's good, it's good timeframe. Eventually you will settle for almost any little breadcrumb of the version of who the narcissist was in the beginning. You may even settle for not having to do anything. You may even settle for not having to do anything. You may even settle for not being punished as a reward or for a version of love bombing. that leads to that this is an addiction issue. An addiction develops in the brain. if you think of a person with drug addiction, in the beginning, it was all positive. The drug gave them a high, it took all their problems away, just made life feel wonderful. But then more and more negative happening. And now they're in a state of depression. And they're in a state of depression. Now the drug is destroying them. But what is going on in the brain. If I do it one more time, maybe I'll get the high again. I need to do it one more time. And they keep going back to the drug, even though it is hurting them and destroying them. That's what's happening in trauma bonding. It started great, but now this person is abusing you and you keep going back to them, hopeful in the future.

avoid loss becomes encoded in the body you might now make an unconscious association between keeping people's secrets and keeping them in your life when you meet someone who let's say abuses you as an adult physically or psychologically or sexually or whatever it is you might feel compelled to lie about it and that's a really strong incentive to help you keep that secret because you have this response in your mind that's telling the truth means dealing with incalculable loss you are naturally incentivized inside of your own mind by your own conditioning to keep people's deep dark secrets and you start lying on behalf of other people another adult child trait is being loyal to a fault and i think that this is kind of all wrapped up in that we believe that telling the truth leads to loss lie to keep other people's secrets and we lie really in those cases most of the time now far we've talked mostly about the lies that you will turn to in childhood if you have complex ptsd but i want to talk about how these tendencies and these patterns of lying mature and develop over the course of your life and express themselves in adulthood the adult version of lying for social inclusion is lying to secure resources lying to get a certain job or to get money or to be able to sign a lease on an apartment when actually you have a really bad credit history by the time you have reached adulthood as a person with complex ptsd you probably have a couple of comorbid mental health issues you've been dealing with on and off for years you probably have patterns of unstable relationships that you've been struggling with because complex ptsd makes intimacy really difficult you might have struggled to hold down a steady job to keep your commitments in various areas because you're not going to be able to get a job because of all of these mental challenges and blocks that you have in the way of day-to-day functioning you might learn to lie to do whatever it takes for you to get money to secure a place to live get ahead in life whether this means making up elaborate stories about why you don't have a reference to give in the workplace whether it means faking a reference for an apartment whether it means forging documents or hiding the money you make or any long sequence of survival skills you have picked up over the course of your life to cover up for all of the other ways in which you struggle to do things in the linear way that other people who do not have a long trauma history seem to be able to easily do things this is again why we call complex trauma complex it has its tentacles in every area of your life for most people who struggle with complex trauma and by the time you are 20 30 40 years old you are probably already covering up for years and years and ever more effort on this and you wouldn't want to make progress but after a but through time important now i need and then i just want to let everything you're talking about going everything you previously talked about being better out of the cliff starting over time you don't you just you really feel berle wall super selves kind of approaching 100 percent and years of circumnavigating the rules and getting around certain barriers and having to find creative ways to keep yourself resourced and alive and thriving in this world."

Number one, you create loyalty through fear. If you ever go against me, you're going to regret it. They demonize anybody that's a rat. And they have the harshest punishments for those who are rats, who talk. Then there's an indoctrination process. Blood is thicker than water. You're always there for your family. You don't have anybody else but your family. they're constantly conditioning them to loyalty, loyalty, loyalty to those that are harmful. And what is really being put into the child's mind is this, that now you're loyal to people who are hurtful, who don't live by love, people that aren't going to be held accountable for their bad decisions and their bad behavior. You have to protect them. You have to keep them from ever experiencing consequences. You have to just take the hurt and not require equal treatment. that is what we're talking about. That is what is beginning to happen. let me just say this. True loyalty is first of all to truth and love. The things that create safety and health. my greatest commitment and loyalty is to loving and to truth. Those are the only things that make a healthy society, healthy relationships. True loyalty is not to a person initially. It's only to people who live out truth and love. I can be loyal to those people because they're safe, they're healthy. But if that person is no longer following truth and love, then I shouldn't be loyal to them. Because to be loyal to them basically is saying, I am being loyal to hurting other people. I am being loyal to violating love, to protecting people from negative consequences that they can continue hurting other people. And that's only going to hurt society. false loyalty is to hurtful people who do more and more damage. But wow, that indoctrination process of false loyalty is deep that people are afraid to break it. Because of what might happen to them if they ever break the loyalty code. The next one."

And again that's a long process but it is absolutely possible. Fifth thing you can realistically expect from the complex PTSD healing process is you start to develop increasingly good discernment about who to trust and in what capacity and the latter is very important. before I took on any sort of healing work in my life I remember feeling the only other people who kind of got me were other people who had some version of complex trauma, extreme attachment wounding, or toxic shame, or depression, or some other debilitating mental illness themselves. And I didn't put it in that language. The language that I kind of had at that point was I'm messed up and I only get along with other messed up people. When I stand next to someone who I consider normal I feel a freak and I get really upset. And I think that's a really good thing to do. And I think that's a really good thing to do. And I think that's a really good thing to do. And I cannot wait to get out of there. And what I tended to think was because someone gets me and because they aren't put off by my kind of rotating door of neuroses that they see once they get close enough that must mean that this is a good person for me to get really close to and to start to co-regulate with. Now again I would never have used that language at that time. I would think more along the lines of thank god another broken person let's go party. And at this point in my journey what I've learned is that yes I'm probably forever no matter how far I come along this road going to relate best to the person I'm going to be with. And I think that's a really good thing to do. I need to relate best to those who also have a history of toxic shame or trauma."

It's only about what makes the parents' lives easier. they got all kinds of rules that actually are hurting them, restricting them, taking the fun out of life. And now they're just rebelling against rules. Any rule they just assume is a bad rule. And now there's the attraction of the forbidden. There's a knee-jerk reaction to any rule. And again, it started out as a good thing, but it turned into a bad thing. Then what you can see when the child is growing up with parents who are hypocrites is they lose respect for those parents. And now when the parent sets a boundary, they go, why should I keep your boundary. I don't respect you. You don't have healthy boundaries. You're not a healthy person. And it's partly the loss of respect that is happening as. But it's also about the loss of connection or lack of connection. the child's tried to connect, but the parents are too busy. The child doesn't feel safe. The child doesn't feel heard. The child doesn't feel seen. The child is trying to have these people as their safe rock in life, but they're just not there for them. And they just react to that. They respond to that. They go, I'm out of here. I want nothing to do with this. I'll find my connection somewhere else. You are not a safe rock. I am setting up my boundaries now I don't get hurt by you. And then it can finally be children who get hurt over and over again by parents in complex trauma can develop this deep anger that turns into a deep resentment. And now they just want to rebel. They just want to hurt the parents back. They just want to be difficult. They just want to cause the parents grief. That's their way of getting revenge. all of those things can feed into oppositional defiance. There's another characteristic relationship-wise, and that is victim mentality. I need to explain that children in complex trauma are legitimate victims. I'm not judging that. I'm not condemning that. Here is a child whose needs aren't getting met, who is being hurt, and they're trying to fix the problem."

I don't think it's important that what others think is who you are. I think if you allow that to become too important to you, it's going to be problematic. Stop basing who you are on what they think, even if you are a scapegoat. Number two, focus on believing in yourself, even if others don't. And again, if they go, oh, , that never happened. No, Johnny never shot Mary. He's got the gun and it's smoking, but he never did that. good and that Johnny shot Mary, in terms of this analogy of reality."

And one of the things I was interested in when I was reading your book, and I was going to ask you to do this, which is to define abuse and to define batterer. And let me just put one thing in here that I was struck by that I read. Physical intimidation can take subtle forms that can carry an implication of threat. And if there is an implication of physical threat, that person who's doing the physical threatening becomes essentially a batterer. Is that correct. That's my definition. And I think that view is fairly widespread in the field. I can't say that's how everybody looks at it, but I would say that view is fairly widespread. my definition of a batterer and I just deal with men who abuse women. We can talk some about same-sex battering, but to be in my area of expertise, I have to talk primarily about men who abuse women. To me, he has become a batterer at the moment in which he is deliberately taking steps to put her in physical fear. He doesn't have to ever touch her. If he raises a fist, , he's trying to put her in physical fear. If he says, , I'm digging a grave for you in the backyard, that's putting her in physical fear. If he says, , I'm going to call immigration on you and they're going to drag you back to Guatemala where you're from because she doesn't have documents, he's putting her in physical fear.

I could be alienating with my sense of humor, and it would come off as insensitive. Sometimes I either said nothing to compensate for this. I would just be really quiet or I would say too much. Three is I lacked social attunement, and I just I missed cues. I didn't always pick up on what people needed. Sometimes I talked over people or I gave advice when all they needed was to be heard. Then number four, I couldn't trust my perception. I was either hyper vigilant and seeing rejection where there wasn't any, or I was completely blind to red flags. I didn't know how to tell what was really going on with people. Five was my boundaries were all over the place. Sometimes I had walls. Other times I just let people. , all over my life.

And this happened not because I wanted it to happen and definitely not because I thought I deserved it. I didn't think I deserved bad treatment, but because I couldn't see the red flags. I just didn't know how to tell when someone was unstable or even dangerous until I was already in too deep. I was attached. And even when things felt wrong, I would second guess myself. I assumed if there's a problem, it's got to be me. And that kind of red flag blindness, it doesn't mean you're weak. It means your early experiences probably distorted your radar.

Anything to keep the spotlight from dimming. This behavior isn't just annoying. It's deeply revealing. What you're witnessing is a person whose ego is on life support. They are emotionally malnourished. They cannot generate a stable sense of self internally, they siphon it from others. It's parasitic. And as they age, and their circle shrinks, they often grow more manipulative to retain whatever scraps of admiration they can find. Think of it this way. Most people age by shifting their values. They begin to find meaning in contribution. In legacy. In spiritual depth. But the narcissist remains fixated on appearance. Not physical appearance alone, but the appearance of significance. They don't want to be meaningful. They want to appear meaningful. It's not about actual impact. It's about perceived impact. they fabricate it. Amplify it. And when that doesn't work, they don't want to be seen. They don't want to be seen. And when that doesn't work, they spiral. And this obsession with validation eventually breeds deep resentment. Because the world stops applauding. It moves on. And the narcissist, who has built no true self, is left scrambling for recognition that no longer comes. They blame others. They're jealous. Disloyal. Ungrateful. They reinterpret the silence of others as evidence of a conspiracy. But it's not a conspiracy. It's consequence. They failed to cultivate something real within themselves. And now they're paying for it. What's worse is that the people around them suffer. Loved ones are pulled into a constant performance, where their only role is to affirm the narcissist's illusion. There's no room for authenticity. No room for conflict. For real intimacy. For growth. Because growth requires discomfort. And the narcissist will not tolerate discomfort, especially if it threatens the image they've worked hard to preserve. they pressure. They guilt trip. They expect applause for basic decency. They take offense when others have needs. Every conversation, every gathering becomes an opportunity to be seen, not to connect. The narcissist doesn't relate. They broadcast. And those who refuse to play along are punished. Emotionally, sometimes financially, always psychologically. In the end their life becomes smaller. Not because they are less valuable. But because their need to be valued overrides their ability to actually build value. Relationships dry up."

And they're jealous if you talk to anybody else, if you go to an activity somewhere. Without them, jealousy kicks in, and they get really cruel when jealousy kicks in, and their control issues go up a notch. Extreme sensitivity and a tendency to be easily hurt, to feel rejected over the slightest little things. if you're with a healthy person, it takes a lot to really make them feel hurt by something that you might do. A narcissist, they feel hurt when you've hardly done anything. Because they pick up hurt easily because of all of their shame issues. But they're not. But then as soon as they feel hurt, guess whose fault it is. It's not their issues, it's yours, and they think you're just selfish. And then they need a mirror. They need that constant reflection. Now let me just say this. that's the 18 characteristics. If you had all 18 of them, you need to talk to me afterwards and go to react. I'm not here to beat up narcissists. Because what happens, what kind of environment creates a narcissist. Severe trauma. Specifically, severe narcissists come out of homes where one of the parents was a severe narcissist. Who belittled them and abused them and put them down and was cruel to them nonstop. And the only way the child could survive was to become a narcissist. And it is an extreme response to extreme cruel treatment. And that is the birthplace of narcissists. , let me end with this. those are the 18 characteristics. Now there's three different types of narcissists. number one is the one we normally think of, which is an exhibitionist narcissist. that's the person who's outgoing and is always talking about how wonderful they are, their great dreams, their great accomplishments, and letting how wonderful they are. We're all familiar with that."

That never really works. We have to replace it, something that the child can feel some trust in, and that is maybe the inner adult. Moving on to the next one, which is a big one, which is called perception problems delays. Problems of perception, i. e. how we interpret people in the world, how ourselves, this is really a top tier childhood trauma symptom of problems of perception. Growing up in abuse, often the abuse itself is a parent damaging a child's perception because the adults have all the power over reality, which is scary. Perception delays are not unlike seeing a preschool age child intensely assume that someone did something on purpose. Many adult childhood trauma survivors can get stuck still assuming things are done on purpose. Sometimes they are, but we can really see our peers not get bogged down in taking things personally, regardless if they are actually offended and someone is a jerk or an idiot or if someone is harmless. I hope that makes sense. Survivors, due to those perception delays, really get into fights in their head, and the offense, real or imagined, stays with them. And I'm saying this from experience here, where we perceive the person really having an issue with us or really making it about us, but it's probably about the other person. You've probably heard that before. It's not about the other person. It's about the other person. It's about the other person. It's about the other person. It's about the other person. But what's tricky about this is often in the toxic family system growing up, things were highly personal. Or if we're still engaged in that family system, they can be highly personal. it's tricky for survivors to embrace thinking differently about the world and not take things personally, but it is possible over time. Essentially, when we have a toxic parent, a child is whatever the parent says they are."

And they feed the thoughts and emotions in a more negative way. And you set up a system that only gets worse and worse inside of you. And it doesn't resolve the shame problem. And you have to start by understanding that system. And here's the main reason why. Everybody has a pattern. And it might start with thoughts and emotions and then it goes to behaviors. And the longer you're in shame, those behaviors become dominoes. They start falling. And if you stay in shame and don't resolve it, the dominoes usually will lead to a relapse. And for most people. without even realizing it, shame is one of their initial dominoes on the road to a relapse. Or it could lead to acting out in self-destructive ways, harmful ways to yourself and to your relationships. the earlier you can catch your pattern and stop the dominoes, the easier it will be to turn it around. But if you don't stop the dominoes, there comes a line. And once you cross that line, it's a line of no return. You are going to do something destructive to yourself. Either a relapse or something else. the whole point of self-awareness is to understand your triggers. Understand how they affect you that you can begin to change them.

Another piece around that is cutting releases natural opioids. that's why when people cut, it actually feels good because it releases opioids in the body and it takes the pain away, the emotional pain away.

That's in my 29 years of healing, I've just sometimes kind of freaked out everything's changing fast, I'm afraid where this is going, I'm afraid it's going to make me alone, and then I just stop using my tools. You pull away from people who support your healing. We've all done it. Sometimes it feels necessary, but then when you're satisfied that not healing isn't what you want really, you can just let that warm river carry you along. I'm very gently towards your own goodness and fulfillment. To be demoralized means to be deflated of all that makes you strong. To have too many bad and discouraging things happen to you until you lose your mental clarity, you lose your drive to bring good into the world. You definitely get disempowered, but it takes that disempowerment one terrible step further to where you lose your awareness or valuing of what is good.

And many people will tell you that this is the case, that it's totally subjective and it's rude to assume wrong from.

All spiritual teachers instruct their students to keep your attention in the present moment. Stay here. Stay here. Stay here. Stay here. Keep your attention here. Now, just as a medical intuitive, I will tell you that when I do readings, here's your energy that's coming into you all the time. Now, it's pouring in now. And we make choices all the time. And one of the choices we make, consciously or unconsciously, is where to distribute our energy. Where to distribute it. Where to distribute it. Distribute it. if you think that in terms of getting 100 pounds of energy, let's say you get 100 pounds a day. Let's put it this way. And you have to invest your 100 pounds per day. You have to invest it. And you can invest it in whatever you want. You can invest it in a creative idea and in your health and in inspiring ways of being and all kinds of things. And helping other people and things that serve life. You can invest it in a combination of that and inner work and creative and in healing and in trying to do things better because whatever. Or you can invest a lot of money in keeping the dead alive. Very useless investments. Investments in things resentments. Resentments. This is keeping the dead alive. we'll put an R there for resentments. how many of you have resentments. And when I say resentments, things that I think should have happened to me, or things that I think should have happened to me, I'm going to put that here on the first floor. we're going to tie it into your building. how many of you have things that you resent because you think they worked out differently and they should have worked out in your favor."

To learn to express that in healthy ways. To learn to manage that. To give up all of the unhealthy ways of anger. There are a lot of tools there. That's a big challenge, but it is an important part of growth and recovery. Because this anger thing, usually we end up damaging those we love the most. And I hope that you're going to realize that. And I hope that you're going to learn to stop doing that. And I hope that you're going to learn to be a heartbreaker. And you're going to learn that you're going to be a heartbreaker. You're going to learn to be a heartbreaker. And that's why we want to grow in this area, is to stop doing damage in intimate relationships. The next characteristic of complex trauma in relationship to emotions is false guilt. true guilt is when I do something that violates love. I should feel guilty because that motivates me to stop lying, to stop stealing, to stop cheating, to stop being disrespectful, to others. true guilt is a powerful, good, negative emotion that's designed anger to push me back to living within the boundaries of love. False guilt comes out of complex trauma. It's when a child is made to feel guilty even though they didn't do anything wrong. It's when they're made to feel responsible for something that wasn't their responsibility at all. This is common in complex trauma, but most people don't even see it. They think their false guilt is actually true guilt. And distinguishing between true guilt and false guilt is a key element in recovery. let me give you some of the ways parents create false guilt. number one, they blame you for stuff as if it was your fault. dad is angry. Somehow dad makes it your fault. Mom is unhappy. Somehow mom makes it your fault. No, it's their choice to be angry, to be unhappy. It's not your fault. That's on them. But to a child, it's your fault that I'm angry. And you believe it. And now you feel guilty when you haven't done anything wrong. Or dad and mom are getting a divorce."

The way out of this one is practicing saying no from our adult space. As reparenting our inner child. Talking about the lack of not being considered. The lack of not being seen. And how our parents or our boss or our partner or our boss does not have the ability to read what is going on with us the way that our inner child wants them to. We can say no to our partner about going out but not really giving them a lot of sort of the business about it. We can say no to a boss, even though that's hard. We can say no to a boss up front by being sort of clear and honest. Sort of clear and forthright about what our responsibilities sort of are. Even if it's hard. hopefully that one made sense. That was a mouthful. number four. Having someone be mad at you slash being misunderstood. Yes. No one is super pumped to have someone be mad at them. But for childhood trauma survivors this is where we ruminate about what we did. Why is the person mad. How do we get them to change our mind at us. How do we state our case. How do we get through to them. Some examples the bus driver who is disgusted with you when you don't have cash on you. The co-worker who is frustrated with you that you've taken time off. Or the partner who is upset with you sort of in a bump. Or even worse, siblings when they feel you're not supporting the toxic parent enough. That's probably an off the charts kind of trigger. This one is rooted in shame. Having people be mad at us and being misunderstood. Growing up in abuse it really wasn't safe to have someone be mad at us. In fact, that is the stuff that stays in a kid's body when they are actively shamed and raged at by a toxic parent. , I can't believe you've done this. I can't believe you would ask me for that now. Is all that stuff that's really actively sort of shaming a child. And I'm being really light about it."
