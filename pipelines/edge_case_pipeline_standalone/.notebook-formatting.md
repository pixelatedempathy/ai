# Jupyter Notebook Formatting Guide

## Problem
Ruff doesn't natively support `.ipynb` files and will show false syntax errors when trying to lint them directly.

## Solution
Use `nbqa` to wrap formatters/linters for notebooks.

## Installation
```bash
pip install nbqa
# or with uv
uv pip install nbqa
```

## Usage

### Format with Black
```bash
nbqa black Edge_Case_Generation_Pipeline.ipynb
```

### Lint with Ruff (check only)
```bash
nbqa ruff Edge_Case_Generation_Pipeline.ipynb
```

### Auto-fix with Ruff
```bash
nbqa ruff --fix Edge_Case_Generation_Pipeline.ipynb
```

### Format all notebooks in directory
```bash
nbqa black *.ipynb
```

## Configuration
Ruff is now configured in `ai/pyproject.toml` to exclude `.ipynb` files from direct linting, which prevents the false syntax errors you were seeing.

## IDE Settings
If you're using VS Code or similar, you may want to:
1. Disable Python linting for `.ipynb` files
2. Use Jupyter-specific extensions for notebook editing
3. Run `nbqa` manually or via pre-commit hooks when needed
