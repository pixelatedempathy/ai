I want to do another talk on the prisons that come out of complex trauma and I want to look at one tonight that's not going to apply to everybody but I think you might be surprised at how many people it does apply to and it's people that engage in criminal behavior and I'm not talking necessarily about hardened criminals I'm talking about some good people that still engage in some criminal behavior and so the purpose of this talk is not to be judgmental it's not to go on a rant or moralistic crusade about all of that stuff it's it's really to understand that what the research is showing is that people that end up in continuing criminal behavior over 90 percent have complex trauma and so the criminal behavior was not the only one that was involved in the criminal behavior.",

    "text": "Money in general for people no matter how healthy they are is a challenge money is this thing that's just a necessary part of life you cannot live without it but it is very tricky to manage it might seem like it's kind of an insignificant thing but you begin to realize that it is connected to just about everything we do and we can go wrong with money in a thousand different directions and the number one or number one cause of conflict the studies say in marriages today is money so it causes all kinds of issues so money is very easy to misuse and it's also very easy to develop the wrong attitude toward no matter who you are what i have learned over the years is if i want to know the priorities of a person watch what they spend their money on so money reveals a lot about you and what's important to you so that's just in general so money is a challenge for everybody but it's an even greater challenge for people in recovery and i got quite a long list and some of you will relate to every single one of the points that i'm going to make but the first major issue around money in recovery is that money can be a true trigger to use and what i have seen over years in working with people in recovery is that for some people that very first payday once they are in recovery also becomes relapse day because they get that first paycheck and their brain goes to boy let's party the second thing that can happen with people is just even having money in your pocket is a trigger i know some addicts who when they get their paycheck they spend it all just to get rid of the money so they are not going to be tempted they do not have any money left for groceries but they spend it all and the temptation is gone and so money can be a huge trigger especially when you begin to look at meth being sold for less money and and so even having a little bit of money can be a problem but not just having money can be a trigger not having money can also be a trigger for some people and so if you do not have money it can be a trigger to start your boosting career up again and getting some money or do a few bit of dealing deal some drugs get some quick money or turn a couple tricks and get some fast money and so not having money can be a trigger and then for some people having a credit card or a debit card is just too big of a trigger it is something that they cannot handle so if you are in recovery you probably relate to some degree to that and then on top of that is gambling addiction shopping addiction and all of that is money related now let's say you get in a relationship then you have money becomes this cause or source of conflict but also stress i do not know many people coming into recovery out of addiction who do not have debts they do not have a huge saving account that's all been gone they got a lot of debt and debt adds a lot of stress to life then for many people coming in out of complex trauma your brain is still in a state of constant gratification and so part of what you have done in your life is just make lots of impulsive decisions so you buy stuff before you have thought about it just because you feel like buying it in that second of time and so impulsive decisions can mean coming home with a new tv and laptop but then the stress that comes up after that and the conflict that comes after that is great and then some people get in a relationship and they spend a whole bunch of money and they come home and they did not ask the other person if it was okay to go and spend 500 they just did it and now they have got a huge conflict i have found that the majority of people in recovery would brand themselves as poor money managers there's some that manage money well but those who are not are not going to be able to manage their money and so they tend to waste money and then struggle to pay bills all of that adds stress and creates conflict some who come out of complex trauma have hoarding issues and i'm going to talk about that a little bit later but that is tied in with the money thing and that can become a real problem for people who are in a complex trauma situation and so i'm going to talk about that a little bit later but that is tied in with the money thing and that can become a source of great conflict not just with a partner but with family and friends as well and then many people that come out of complex trauma even poverty and addiction can have a very distorted view of success and they can come into recovery thinking that if i just get enough money to buy what i want then i will be happy so their definition of happiness and success is tied into getting lots of money and they set themselves up for disappointment i also have encountered many clients who grow up in a family where parents have defined success by the possessions you own the house you live in and so the child still gets pressure from the parent to have certain things to prove that they are successful and the parent wants the child to have it because that child is an embarrassment to the parent if they do not have it so they get lots of pressure and our culture gives us the same message i have also found that many clients coming out of complex prom trauma and poverty often look at people with lots of money and because they wear a smile in public they think those are happy people and then they are envious of them and they walk around saying if i just had what they had then i would be happy and i often say do you know anything about their private life because just because they wear a smile does not mean they are happy but that is what can easily happen and so one of the things that's really important to understand up front is this money is a big part of what is necessary to help my children that's what is needed and so what is very easy to think is that more money is the solution to my problems i hope you know that that's a lie that just having external things does not make me a happy person that happens from a healthy internal life not from more things okay now it's really hard for people in addiction to manage money when they come in and then they go out of their house and have to work again into recovery.",

    "text": "They did not pay attention to you. Commitment to you might be defined just as somebody attuned to meeting my needs some other ones that people have is they grew up where parents did not do anything fun with them and so for them commitment is you do fun things together or parents who broke their promises so commitment is you keep your promises or parents who did not set good boundaries or enforce those boundaries or parents who did not stick together through tough times and so for you commitment is sticking together no matter what or you had parents that cheated on each other so the emphasis for you is commitment is you are faithful sexually to your partner parents who did not fulfill their responsibilities or parents who did not make sacrifices and so for you commitment is all about sacrifices and responsibility so all of that just to say be aware as you think about this topic of your early definitions of what commitment means now having said that i want to then go to k what does commitment mean what is a full picture that will help us understand commitment because you cannot build trust unless there's somebody in your life who's committed to you so commitment i want you to understand is the essential part of your relationship so the first component is commitmentじゃあ when an enriched when you want to grow together go out there and spread the gospel and have fun doing them and in that way can you come to that middle point and how you reach those sentiments now when you have someone contacting you for a while there's always there's still grass between to a beyond a certain point and that is so important to understand so commitment is continuing to do the right thing even when you do not feel like it it's continuing to follow the same priorities principles course of action at all times regardless of the circumstances now in complex trauma it's very important to understand that in light of the limbic brain versus the cortex brain so commitment will never get carried out if you live only in your limbic brain because that's your child brain and what does the child brain say I will do something if I feel like it but if I do not feel like it I'm not going to do it well that's not going to carry out a commitment it's going to be a commitment to the child brain and that's what commitment is and that's a commitment if you only do it when you feel like it and so to maintain commitment you have to go to your cortex that says I'm going to do this on days I feel like it but also on days I do not feel like it so what is involved it's hanging in there when life gets hard and overwhelming it's continuing to do the right thing day after day even though you are not seeing immediate results it's like the farmer who plants the seed waters it weeds it but is not seeing results yet there's a waiting time but you are still doing the right stuff but then with commitment there's an element of exclusivity that you are faithful sexually and emotionally now foreign to have a healthy relationship with my wife I have to be committed to her but if I'm committed to her then that means I cannot have that type of relationship with any other women in the world so it excludes other people if I'm going to have a healthy relationship with my children I got to be committed to them and that means I cannot be using all of my time doing other things and and having tons of other relationships with other people because that would take away from my commitment to my children so just having a committed relationship means I have to exclude relationships with others and it means I cannot say yes to all kinds of activities I have to start saying no to a whole bunch of activity because that will prevent me from carrying out my commitment to my children and I might be saying no to very worthwhile activities but I have to in order to maintain that commitment the next thing that happens in a committed relationship is it's the understanding that your needs are just as important as mine so that we are going to work together to make sure both of our needs are being met so I'm going to meet some of my own needs but I'm going to need your help with others you are going to meet most of your needs but you are going to need my help with others so that then means at times we are going to have to make sacrifices at times we are going to have to give when we are not feeling we are getting anything back right away so sacrifice becomes part of this but then it also means I'm not going to abandon you now this is really important for people from complex trauma because what happens in complex trauma when you do not feel somebody's there for you to help you through a difficult situation is you feel abandoned but then what happens is you believe that you must be the reason they abandon you you must have many flaws you are not worth it so you then abandon yourself you do not even like yourself and so what happens now in being committed to yourself is you are saying to the wounded part of you I will not abandon you again I am committed to working through this stuff with you the next thing that's part of commitment is open honest communication and no secrets we are going to share and talk honestly but then it means accepting the person that you are in the relationship with where they are at their personality you accept them as they are and you form an attachment with them a secure attachment that means you are a Safe person that means you are attuned to how they are doing you are aware of their emotions that means that you care about their pain just as much as you care about your own pain that means you work hard through your challenge through operation and those issues that you know will have paid off that can be THAT'S WHAT YOU are DOING WHEN YOU have BEEN SUPPOSED TO 이 מאוד means you work hard to get to understand them so that you get them so that you get to know them intimately their deepest dreams passions fears wounds you want to understand them that's part of commitment it also involves you desire what is best for them and it means you are all in many people from complex trauma when they go into a relationship they go in with always needing an escape hatch if this gets a little bit tough I'm out of here with commitment is I have got to know you and I'm prepared to commit to you which means I'm all in I am going to give myself to this I'm jumping in with both feet and what that means is not only do I choose you today I'm going to choose you again tomorrow and I'm going to choose you the next day I'm going to choose you over and over and over again more than that commitment means we are going to have problems but we are going to work them out we are going to resolve them and to do that I have to be willing to own my part you have to be willing to own your part we both have to be willing to change that's the only place where commitment will work to produce healthy people as we have problems commitment means we are committed to respect each other even in the problems I am not going to disrespect you further I am going to be willing to go to being vulnerable as we work through problems and that means I'm going to expose weaknesses to you I'm going to be authentic I'm going to share who I really am with you and then when it comes to making decisions I am going to do my thinking not just so that the decision benefits me but so that it benefits both of us so I'm going to think for two when I am thinking about a decision and I want it to benefit you just as much as it benefits me I am going to show up on days that I am tired hurt angry stressed out distracted I'm still choosing to be present and to love even on those difficult days now think of where did commitment begin it began by thinking this person has value this person means a lot to me and so what I am going to do moving forward is continue to see you and treat you as somebody is having great value to me that therefore means that yes I will acknowledge weaknesses that you have but I am not going to focus on them with a desire to tear you down because if I focus only on the negatives in you you will lose value in my mind which will cause me to have trouble maintaining my commitment so to keep my commitment growing I have to continue to choose to treat you with respect to see you as having great value to me and then for people with complex trauma commitment means fighting through fears that are going to be triggered as the relationship deepens as the relationship deepens there's going to be a fear of oh oh and I do care but that's not trying drew on my commitments fear every moment I am alwayshuh hear we have to save that need to serve me to see myero OF USE the fear our日本ese care is really about improving the shape and government oh, they are getting to know me better, or are they going to abandon me.",

On for months after coming out of the relationship and then others find that they have just physical pain all of a sudden they are just aware that they hurt in different parts of their body and then there's relationship indicators that you might see so you make friends with new people but now you find this intense fear of abandonment that they are probably going to abandon me once they start to get to know me and that just becomes consuming and that can lead to jealousy issues or sabotaging relationships or you tend to reenact old dynamics so you are attracted to a narcissist you put up with red flags and stuff in the relationship that you should not and pretty soon you are back into a narcissistic relationship most struggle with balance boundaries because with a narcissist you could not have any boundaries so now they go to either very rigid boundaries or not at all they just do not know how to set boundaries how to enforce boundaries how to say no and so boundaries is a huge issue and then they just find they become quite emotionally numb so they have difficulty feeling joy they have difficulty getting close to anybody just showing warmth affection there's just a flatness a roboticness about them it's just like their emotions have shut down so how did you do those are some of the indicators of complex trauma complex ptsd and so if those were true of you after you have come out of a relationship with a narcissist i'm not surprised because what i want you to see is is that a narcissist does not know how to provide safety, does not know how to meet needs for another person, does not know how to connect with another person.",

    "text": "So let's look in a different perspective. We have got a little bit of a mix up here. They should be getting from a person but there's not it's not happening with people so let's try to get the feelings from things so they might have a teddy bear a blanket they might get a new bike and that bike just makes them feel so good it gives all the positive feelings that they should have got from people but now they get from a thing then it goes beyond that they then develop activities that are soothing that give them really good feelings that help them disconnect from the pain of their day-by-day existence that help them not have to be present in the pain of their day by day but escape that pain for a while and have good feelings so they might escape to a fantasy world they might just play video games all day and that takes them out of their world they might eat food and food gives them the good feelings and and takes them out of the world they might find masturbation and that takes them out and gives them all the good feelings they might get into porn they might get into sports or even extreme sports and adrenaline rush stuff but they begin to find activities that give them all the good feelings give the feelings that are really good and they develop connections they attach to those activities as being lifelines as being necessary things for them to get their needs met to be happy and then part of what develops with that is they are witnessing the world around them is they begin to develop beliefs that if i have this type of success if i have this much money this much position if i have this body if i have these possessions if i have this friend group they develop an image of what they think will make them truly happy and then they develop an attachment to that image to the status that they think they need so what i want you to realize is what comes out of their life are certain things complex trauma is the child is still driven to connect and if they cannot connect in a healthy way with mom and dad they will find other things to connect with and those things will not give true secure attachment they will give some of the feelings but they will leave their soul empty but they will still connect with it because it does give positive stuff but it will lead to great heartache down the road so what that means in recovery is that if you are going to get healthy then you have to let go of the unhealthy connections with unhealthy people with unhealthy activities with unhealthy things now the problem is that if you are going to get healthy is that with a lot of those things there was some aspects of them that were healthy playing a video game eating food having sex there's a healthy part to that but you have attached to it in a way that you have overdone it and you have overused that to try to meet needs it was not designed to meet and now you have an unhealthy aspect to that connection so you have got some healthy connection stuff happening but lots of unhealthy connection stuff and so for you to get healthy it's for you to begin to realize i have to separate what part of this is healthy what part of this is unhealthy i can maintain a relationship with this thing in a healthy way but i need boundaries now so that i do not slide into the unhealthy relationships what i might find in some cases is this person or this activity or this thing is totally unhealthy it is totally toxic for me i need an extreme boundary where i cut it out of my life but for most things i am going to find a change in boundaries i'm not going to have the old boundaries that allowed allowed healthy and unhealthy i now i'm going to have new boundaries that will only allow the healthy and cut out the healthy and that is the thing that i'm going to find a change in boundaries i'm not going to have a change in boundaries that will only allow the healthy and cut out the healthy and that is the thing that i'm going to find a change in boundaries i'm not going to have a change in boundaries that takes a ton of work and time to figure out but that is recovery now let me show you a second part of complex trauma so not only are all these connections happening that are unhealthy they are adaptations coping behaviors that are happening that are allowing the child to survive to protect them from being hurt to try and get their needs met and what you find is some of the adaptations the parents approve of other adaptations that parents do not approve of and so the adaptations that get validation from parents you develop a special attachment to those are the hardest to let go so let me give you some examples of some of the adaptations and again many of them have a mix of healthy and unhealthy so a child who might be naturally funny and that gets validation from their parents might just conclude they need to be funny all the time or a child might conclude that to stay safe they have to always be in control and so they work to become control of everything and everybody or and they are going to survive and get their needs met they need to be a people pleaser they need to learn to read the rules and they need to be able to be a good person and they need to be able to be a good person but sometimes or nice findings of their own and then get to work and get a bit of their needs met so third we have incitement from the bottom and 96% are inclined towardsFF you know it are a not you and you are੒ ent 궁금MM is when false sources

It but there's still a lot more that needs to be done the next common thing is so many people come in to treatment or into counseling because they are in a current crisis their partner and them have just had a terrible fight their partner's threatening to leave them unless they get help and so they come in and they go i need help but what they are really saying is i want to fix the current crisis so my partner does not leave me just give me the tools to handle conflict just give me the tools to handle my wife's moods what i want to do with them is to go yes we are going to work on those things well i want you to begin to look at what are the deeper issues that cause the conflict that cause the ways that you have to deal with conflict and that's what i want you to do handle conflict that cause some of the moods and emotional dysregulation a lot of people i do not want to go there just give me tools what you have to realize is a lot of people start recovery for a crisis but if they are going to actually succeed in recovery they got to go to the deep issues if they only stay at trying to fix a crisis they might get a short-term solution but it's just going to come up again because they are going to be stuck in a crisis and they are not going to be able to get away with it and they are not going to be able to get away with it and they are not going to be able to get away with it and they are not going to be able to get away with it because they have never dealt with the deep issues it is such an important part of this the next one is so many people come to me and they go just give me the tools kind of there's got to be at least two or three tools that you can give me that will just kind of fix all of my problems right now recovery is tools but recovery is healing deep stuff changing core beliefs core issues recovery is healing deep stuff changing core beliefs core issues that are not just quick magic tools that fix that so always understand yes there are tools those come later usually it's the deep stuff that you have to really deal with or else the tools will never work now one of the things that's sometimes helpful for people is to have some metaphors or analogies of recovery and then you can start to think about how to use them to help you get out of that deep that might that will help them in this healing journey so the thought of people going back to deal with trauma is a scary scary thing to them they are opening a can of worms that they are afraid is going to be overwhelming so sometimes an illustration like watching a child that's going to watch a scary movie and they know it's going to be scary and they are really i do not know if i want to do this but then what you can do is is do have you ever watched another movie that was scary at first yes yeah it was really terrifying but did you watch it a second time yes was it a scary no because i kind of knew it was coming and and i knew kind of how it would turn out did you watch it a third time and a fourth time and what they begin to realize is okay as i process that movie each time it got easier each time it was less scary and so that's going to be similar to when you are reprocessing trauma.",

    "text": "And so, all of a sudden they find themselves sliding back into old behaviors. Now they are eating too much, they are sleeping too much they are avoiding things they are procrastinating and it's just starting to happen and they do not know why because they have been disconnected from all of that and if they keep giving into that and letting those old behaviors continue pretty soon they are going to be an even darker place pretty soon they are going to be even more depleted and so it's super dangerous for them but then what happens to many people when they finally clue in okay i'm overeating again and i'm doing all of my old behaviors here what's going on oh i must be depleted all i need is a day at the spa that will fix everything i just need self-care and they go for a day at the spa and it does not help a whole lot it helps a little but it does not help a whole lot it helps a little bit but it does not help a whole lot it helps a little bit but it does not help a whole lot that's what i want us to understand so we need self-awareness around when we are depleted the things that deplete us but we also need self-awareness around am i meeting consistently my 12 needs because if i'm not i'm going to become depleted those are so crucial so let me let me let me develop what depletes us and there's been some amazing research done around this that i find quite fascinating and so i'm going to share it with you so we all most readily think of being depleted tired or exhausted because of physical labor because of physical work about doing too much i'm just exhausted so when we think of depletion we tend to think of it in four ways and we think of it in four ways and we think of it in four ways and we think of it in physical activity terms let me develop that and and it's partly right but there's a whole bunch more things other than physical that deplete us and that's where we are going to get to but let me give you a bigger context here any time so we have got our sympathetic nervous system which is our activity and our parasympathetic nervous system which is our rest they need to be in balance if we are going to keep our gas tanks full to stay healthy not burnout so if my sympathetic nervous system is going too much and my parasympathetic nervous system is not allowed to bring in rest and healing and rejuvenation i eventually am going to become depleted and so for people from complex trauma this is why we become depleted and depleted so easily because we are used to being in our sympathetic nervous system all the time because we are in survival mode and so it's easy to slide back into that that's been the default setting for years and so big picture what we are looking at with depletion is learning when i'm in my sympathetic nervous system when i'm back in survival modes type of stuff and not in my parasympathetic in the right balance that is the big picture of what we are looking at now let me just say this when we go into our sympathetic nervous system it actually for many people feels good because we get an adrenaline rush we get more energy we feel more alive we do not feel depleted and so we go this is a good thing but what you do not realize is if you do not get to the parasympathetic in the right balance being in your sympathetic nervous system you are not going to be in the right balance so if you are in a parasympathetic too much feels good for now but it's slowly taking its toll and using up gas that you are not replenishing and pretty soon you are going to burn out you are going to be depleted so let me give you some of the physical things that they are finding so besides just overworking over go go go all the time not getting enough sleep what they are finding is a person who loves multitasking and so they are always wanting to multitask that takes a lot of energy and so it can deplete us more quickly than a person who just does one thing at a time another thing they are finding is people that live in cluttered messy spaces without realizing that's actually depleting them that that's taking energy out of them just to live in that space another one is being cooped up inside all alone so you do not go out you do not connect you do not interact with people you do not do anything social you just stay cooped up that takes a lot of energy other ones not drinking enough water so dehydration another one people who live with chronic physical pain so just living with pain take a ton of energy so those people get depleted people that are fighting a sickness an infection a virus get depleted because it takes a lot of energy to fight those things people recovering from surgery where their bodies doing a ton of healing physically are very tired and then people who go through a major move or a major major change in life job wise moving to a different city a new relationship a child moving away from home a new baby ton of energy required and so they can become very depleted because of that so those are all physical things but what i want you to realize is that's only a small part of what depletes us one of the things that depletes us probably more than anything is emotions so let's talk about that because for people from complex trauma who have suppressed emotions disconnected from emotions they do not realize how much energy emotions take and so what we find for many people who take our lift program or react program is after a couple weeks they are just exhausted and they go why i have not been doing anything and they are still thinking in terms of physical activity is the only thing that makes you tired and i go you know you are doing human's work when it comes to emotions right now and you are exhausted because of all the emotional work that you are doing and that's a new concept for them so things that deplete us in the emotional world and it's fascinating to me what they are finding out is when you have a physical activity and you are tired and you are exhausted and you are exhausted and you are you have stuff emotions all the time so you have got anger coming up you stuff it down you have got fear coming up you stuff it down that's intense emotional stuff that you are stuffing if you go through loss and you stuff it down it's like holding a beach ball underwater it takes a lot of energy to stuff down an intense emotion and so you get depleted because of that second one with that is every time you feel an intense emotion like anger deep fear huge amount of stress hate deep sense of injustice those are intense intense emotions and they all involve cortisol any intense emotions that brings about cortisol you will be exhausted afterwards they take a ton of energy to do that so you are not going to be exhausted you are not going to be exhausted so you are not going to be exhausted and so you are not going to be exhausted and that's the key to this and that's the key to this is that you have to have a lot of energy so just feeling and expressing very intense emotions requires a lot of energy next one i have already kind of referred to and it's processing old wounds old trauma that you have been suppressing for years but now you are bringing it out and talking about it processing it crying about it healing feeling the emotions of it that's exhausting that is hard work and it is very depleting so if you are in a recovery program expect to be tired another one is if you are carrying an intense resentment towards somebody that takes a lot of energy another one if you have a conflict an intense conflict with somebody you can expect you are going to be exhausted afterwards because that intense conflict took a ton of energy next one if you are sitting in an intense emotion that cannot quickly be resolved so you have just lost somebody you are grieving you just do not magically make that go away you got to sit in it or if you are going through a time of change so you are going to be going to a new job going through a move there's a lot of anxiety and insecurity around that living in the unknown that creates emotions you cannot magically make it go away so you got to sit in them sitting in those emotions takes a lot out of you if you are in a dangerous place so you are there's a war going on you are sitting in intense emotions that you cannot magically make disappear if you have got financial problems you cannot just make disappear those take a lot out of you the emotions that you have to sit in another important one is when you are supporting somebody who's going through a very painful time so you are listening to them you are feeling compassion to them you are spending time with them you are going to be exhausted compassion fatigue is going to be there another one is if you get triggered an old wound an old issue gets triggered so you feel disrespected you feel hurt you feel disrespected you feel not heard not seen rejected all of that and you lash out you lose it you just fly off the handle and you go on a rampage in your triggered dysregulated state you are going to be exhausted afterwards it giving in to that trigger and going to your limbic brain and just fueling letting it fuel a whole bunch of behaviors takes a lot of energy another one they are finding is if you are constantly just negative in a negative place in your head criticizing everything being negative about everything complaining about everything in your life it takes a lot of energy it depletes you and so part of that is because you are not giving your brain the good chemicals it needs the serotonin the dopamine the oxytocin that it needs to feel good to get energy you are depriving it of that by just focusing on negative all the time and it depletes you if you become involved in a cause a very important cause let's say climate related racial related equality of the sexes related injustice at work whatever if you become a in a cause that is passionate to you it's going to stir up a lot of intense emotions and that can be very draining especially if you then spend time on social media on the internet researching the cause listening to what other people say about the cause it keeps stirring up intense emotions and that can be very draining if you are a perfectionist perfectionist or if you are a bit of a control freak you just always want to control everything in everybody's life that takes a lot of emotional energy it takes a lot of energy and so there's going to be a depletion that can come out of that now let me take this a little bit further in the deeper complex trauma territory most people that come out of complex trauma have what i call a default setting it's where their brain naturally just has become used to and is their normal so that could be fear that could be shame that could be feeling guilt all of those just that's the way they have lived all their childhood is feeling those emotions and so now that's just their normal their default setting so if you have a default setting of shame i'm not good enough my life sucks i'm not valuable i'm not lovable that's going to result in a default setting where you are always seeking validation maybe or approval from others that's draining so what i want you to see is certain default settings take a lot of energy so some of the other default settings is always worrying about what people think so an insecurity what do they think of the what do they think of my hair what do they think of my looks what do they think of how i just performed it takes a lot of energy if you have a false guilt that's always been your default setting you need to feel guilty to feel normal that takes a lot of energy if you have always had an anger and you need to feel angry to feel normal that takes a lot of energy if you have got anxiety or negativity that we talk about that takes a lot of energy if that's your default setting and your brain's just naturally keeps gravitating back to wanting to feel negative and anxious some are always living by should say unrealistic expectations for themselves i should be doing this i should be doing that that takes a lot of energy if that's your default setting perfectionism controlling we have talked about if you are a person that your default setting is stuffing emotions that's the first thing you do when you feel an emotion is want to stuff it and be stoic that takes a lot of energy if you have a default setting that does not want to feel emotions so you just have distractions all the time that takes a lot of energy so what i want you to see is when you look at the 60 characteristics of complex trauma that we talk about a lot of those 60 characteristics can become a default setting for people from complex trauma and most of those characteristics if you think about it you realize whoa it takes a lot of energy to have that is my normal so it's important to begin to realize that people coming out of complex trauma they have come to a place as their default setting that constantly is depleting so important to understand so that's just the emotional so let's go to the third the pleading category and that's the intellectual what they have realized happens when we enter a bigbrahimani society it becomes our taşương is again we have our conscious brain and our subconscious brain so our subconscious brain is working 95 of the time we are just in autopilot we are just doing all kinds of different things we are not even aware of that does not take tons of energy it's our conscious brain and so that's the intense cognitive processing so reading thinking analyzing problem solving doing calculations memorizing explaining stuff to people where we ought to be in our conscious brain that takes a lot of energy in fact it takes about a third of our calories our inner conscious brain and so if you are in a day where you are just doing a lot of intense thinking processing calculating teaching and you are using a lot of calories and so that takes a lot of energy and so that's whatent Muchas gracias you are doing a lot of talking you are doing a lot of learning you are doing a lot of Forever and growing and building utibilidad and building confidence and building patience analyzing skills and building awareness and building confidence so you are going to be tired afterwards.",

    "text": "A lot of people when they are lonely and they think I just need a relationship part of what they are thinking is I need somebody else to fix me and what I want you to see again is so much of what happened in childhood parents should have met your needs but they did not the way that they should have and usually because they did not know any better but now you have to parent yourself you have to learn to meet those needs because that was the goal of parenting was to meet those needs until you learned how to meet them yourself and so for you to now expect somebody else to be a parent and meet all your needs is for you to stay in a very childlike immature state and that's only going to cause relationships to fail another thing that can lie that can happen for some people is getting married will secure the relationship so they start dating and or living together and and all of a sudden there's stuff that's going on that is creating some insecurities the relationship in trouble are we going to make it we are starting to have more and more problems and more more issues and so the solution is we just need to get married that will make sure the relationship gets stable again is secure that we are going to stick together and it's kind of fantasy thinking magic thinking but it goes deeper than that what it's really thinking is that the ritual of the marriage ceremony is going to create stability and security so it's putting my sense of security in a ritual but the reality is rituals can be empty rituals do not provide security that's a false sense of security security comes when both people are committed to working through issues together in healthy ways are committed to keep growing in their own life committed to growing in love in the relationship and all that that means and meeting of needs then you have security but what is so easy for people coming out of complex trauma is they did not have security there was chaos in the home parents were not there for them they did not have a connection and that's where security is supposed to come from is healthy connection mainly it's also supposed to come from parents providing a safe environment but it's mainly coming from connection but when you do not have connection what children often do is to think the path to security is to have the external environment that looks stable so let's have the good job the nice house the money in the bank let's get married that provides security but it's got it backwards security comes from true connection from both wanting to get healthy a third one is also kind of magical thinking and it's if it's true love it will just work and we get this in movies and songs all the time I met you I fell in love with you we both feel so strongly towards each other have such 100% positive feelings for each other think only 100 positively about each other we seem to get along so well together we have never had a conflict it's just going to work and that is limbic brain that's oxytocin and the effect of oxytocin creating these intense positive feelings but that's very child like child looking at the future based on how what they are feeling right now they are not looking realistically at here's what makes for a healthy life here's what makes for a healthy relationship here's what life is really all about and what true happiness the recipe for true happiness and success are they just go I feel good so this I just need to keep reproducing whatever's making this feeling it will be great forever and so again a relationship is not guaranteed to work because you both have a good feeling a relationship only works if both people are committed to get healthy committed to work through stuff in healthy ways are committed to meeting 12 needs love and so what that means in very practical terms is a relationship only works if both people are able to have secure attachment if they are both still an insecure attachment they are going to have trouble relationships only going to work if both are able to be authentic if if they are wearing masks or fawning it's not going to work it's only going to work if they are able to be vulnerable and to open up and to allow deeper and deeper intimacy if they treat each other with respect as equals that your needs matter just as much as mine if they are able to be present and emotionally available to the other person if they are able to trust if they are able to communicate if they were set healthy boundaries those are the ingredients of a healthy marriage it does not matter the feelings they come and go you have to have those motivation stones and if they are not there you can have all the fantasy thinking you want and all the magical thinking you want but it will not create a healthy relationship there's a fourth lie that comes out of parts of our culture and that is I'm in love with you I will never have feelings with for anybody else and I think anybody who's lived very long at all knows that that's a lie yes I have strong feelings for you now and in this moment I do not have feelings for anybody else but over time those feelings will dim a little bit I will probably feel some attraction to others that's just being human that does not mean I'm failing that does not mean I love you that just means I'm a human so let me just expand on that a little bit what happens in complex trauma is it sets you up to think that these intense feelings coming out of oxytocin coming from this attraction that I'm feeling that they are going to last forever the reality is is if people that people from complex trauma have not learned how to connect in healthy ways and so their only feeling of connection is intense feelings but if you have not learned to connect in healthy ways you are going to get into a relationship with intense feelings but not have true connection and what's going to happen without true connection and those feelings are going to quickly disappear and then what's going to happen is the next person you see that creates intense feelings you are going to feel connection to them and all of a sudden part of you wants to move on and so it's the issue is not the intense feeling the issue is is there true connection because if there's not then you are going to find yourself attracted to others more than that lack of connection leads to discontent the relationship becomes boring the relationship becomes frustrating and so not being able to connect creates a real vulnerability to be attracted to others but there's more than that every relationship has its ups and downs you can have true connection but it's not always going to have intense emotions true connection does not need intense emotions but yet you are going to meet people and feel an attraction too that's normal that does not mean there's something wrong in the relationship that just means you are human but you need to know how to handle those feelings of being attracted to others so that you do not feed them because if you start feeding them then that can pull you away from the true connection to back to this connection to back to this very oxytocin intense feeling, which could be very unhealthy.",

    "text": "This course and you guys need to take it or I just watched this video you guys caused my trauma you are the problem that's just probably going to backfire that's going to lead to really a negative response a defensiveness and a total shutdown so do not think you can neg them into change do not think you can take shots at them and make them want to change do not think that you can just confront them and tell them they are messed up and that they are all of a sudden going to want to change the best way to get them to be open to change is if they see you changing they see you getting healthy they see you responding differently all of a sudden that's going to influence them impact them and potentially cause them to go maybe I need to look at some stuff so you have to really realize that the way to get change is to be open to change and to be open to change and to be open to change get my partner my parents to be willing to consider change is that I have to be the change I have to role model it I have to change and that potentially will put salt in their oats that will get them a thirst a curiosity to learn more and to be maybe willing to change one of the things that you might do if you are in a relationship and do not do but let's get this in balance is this do not just idly threaten somebody to leave it to you just bring it along and just make it them saying if you do not change if you do not look at your stuff if you do not watch these videos i'm out of here but you do not really mean it that is really going to backfire but you may need to sit down with your partner and say unless i see some changes in you some willingness to learn this relationship's not going to work and i'm going to have to consider moving on and that leads us to the rationale for that which is the second bottom line and that is realizing that a relationship can only work or a relationship could only be healthy if both people are getting healthy in their individual life which means that both people are willing to change both people are willing to work on their stuff both people are willing to learn and to grow as individuals if only one person is changing but the other person is remaining in their behaviors that are not healthy the one person being willing to change is not going to create a healthy relationship they can want it desperately they can be willing to grow and change as much as possible but if the other person is not willing to change you will never end up with a healthy relationship it is impossible that is so important to understand because so many people keep hoping that if they just change a little bit more then the relationship will get healthy no it takes two to tangle the other person if they are not willing to change their relationship will not work and so that's why you may have to go to the other person once you realize they are not willing to change and say hey if you are not willing to change then this relationship is done now let me give you a big picture here as we build this scaffolding what i i have done much marriage counseling over the years and what i have realized is when you get two people with complex trauma in a relationship you end up with three sets of baggage so person a comes in with their own individual baggage from their trauma from their past person b comes in with their individual baggage from their trauma from their past then as they live together they create a third person who is willing to change their relationship and that's what we call a healthy relationship and that's what we call a healthy relationship and that's what we call a healthy relationship and that's what we call a healthy set of baggage unresolved conflicts between them unresolved issues and so what typically happens when a couple comes to see me for marriage counseling is they are focused on the third set of baggage the problems that have developed between them they are hoping that i will give them tools which usually is magical fix for the third set of baggage and then their relationship will be fine so in their mind the issue is the problems that have developed between them if they could just fix them the relationship would be good what i want them to realize is the third set of baggage came out of baggage a baggage b that has not been dealt with that has not been resolved so the way to fix the third set of baggage is not some magical little tools although we are going to have some tools the way to fix the third set of baggage is person a's got to work on their baggage person b's got to work on their baggage and as they get healthier they are going to have to work on their baggage and as they get healthier then they can resolve the third set of baggage so the bottom line is this you cannot fix problems in a relationship unless both people individually are willing to work on their individual stuff once they get to a healthy enough point then they will learn tools to resolve some of the third set of baggage but if they do not work on their own set of stuff they are just going to create a barrier to resolve the third set of baggage and then they can resolve the third set of baggage and then they can resolve the third set of baggage and then they can resolve more and more third type of baggage.",

It's so important to say that most people from complex trauma have dealt with depression over 90 percent and that means that most have had suicidal ideation at some time because life sucks the brain thinks it would i have tried everything to escape this pain i have tried everything to resolve this pain there's no solution that i have been able to find therefore it makes sense that the only solution left is to kill myself to have suicidal ideation does not mean you are planning to act on it it just means your brain is continuing to explore options to escape the pain so do not beat yourself up about it recognize that it happens and continue to reach out for help so one of the things that i have realized with many people from complex trauma is they have lived with mild depression as their normal or depression deeper depression as their normal their default setting and so they do not even think they are depressed because that's been their normal that's how they think everybody is and so it's important to begin to understand the signs of depression so that i can begin to identify whether i am depressed or not so signs of depression you feel like you are being sucked into this black hole that there's just a darkness that is pulling at you you begin to lose interest in things that usually you enjoy you begin to lose motivation to do things even the things that you enjoyed those are signs of depression losing interest losing motivation when you do stuff that you normally would have given you pleasure it's not giving you pleasure anymore so more and more of life becomes drudgery more and more and more of life takes effort you feel more and more robotic you are going through the motions nothing is giving you pleasure and then there's a growing feelings of worthlessness i have nothing to offer my life sucks i'm not a happy person nobody wants to be with me i feel i cannot i do not have the energy to perform anything i just have this growing feeling of worthlessness and then there's a growing feeling of helplessness i cannot get myself out of this i just am growing and feeling overwhelmed more and more i i'm losing the ability to cope with anything those are growing inside of you then that leads to growing feelings of antisocial i just want to flight i want to avoid people i resist social interaction it just takes too much work i'm not in a good headspace it creates panic so i just want to isolate all the time then there's a usually growing irritability i'm not in a good headspace i'm not in a good headspace i'm not in a good headspace i'm not in a good headspace i'm not in a good headspace i'm not in a good headspace you just do not have the emotional reserves to handle problems to handle change to handle annoyances then you be get more negative more pessimistic you just see the dark the negative side of things and then for people that can lead to change in weight change in appetite you you do not want to eat at all or you want to eat all the time change in sleep patterns you want to sleep all the time or you cannot sleep for some people they begin to have physical pain on top of the emotional pain others they begin to get tired overwhelming fatigue is constantly there they have difficulty concentrating on anything and it begins to affect their memory so those are all characteristics of deepening depression so if you have those reach out for help learn from the experience and learn from the experience and learn from the experience and learning to manage depression learning to improve depression becomes such a vital part in recovery there's a ton of tools to learn but it is so important but there is hope the final one i want to cover today is wanting to hope but being afraid to hope this one is so important to understand what happens to a child is they come into they have this need to be authentic, this need to have all their needs met.",
