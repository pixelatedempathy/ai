    "text": "That's validation.  , and somebody wants to connect with us that's validation, but that is kind of, Yeah. Foreign territory for so many people yeah that's really validation yeah I mean that's what I'm really learning right here right now is just understanding the word validation and what it really means that it's not because you you know I have always thought it's just words well not just words but that's how I took it because I actually had a very dear friend I want to say validate me verbally for the first time in my life outside of therapy and I cannot tell you what that did for me but I love that you are sharing that it's the actions that when someone wants to connect with you that's validation when you are treating yourself well that's validation and so really starting with and you are so right about the self-awareness I preach about that all the time that you need to have self-awareness for this healing journey because that's what's really going to help you out and and if you begin to just look at how you are treating yourself look at what's going on in your head and what you are allowing you know and and changing that yeah and if I can add one other piece to this so many kids in complex trauma validating words were actually forms of manipulation they always have a hidden agenda so I'm going to say nice things about you to manipulate you to get I have got an ulterior motive for what I want you to do for me so that for me is what I have wanted you to do for me and so that's what's really key for me that for me is what I want you to do for me so that for me is what I have wanted many people as soon as they hear validating words they go i wonder what they really want oh yeah and there's a immediate on guard suspicion that words never mean what they really say there's always a hidden meaning and a hidden agenda and i'm immediately on guard and so that's where for most people they eventually need the healing power of words but they first need words are just too scary for them they need people to treat them with respect yeah that's so true yeah i in my first marriage there was a lot of words and not a lot of action or the actions did not line up with the words and i cannot tell you how frustrating that is and it got to the point where i just i really got to the point where i did not trust anybody what anybody had to say i did not even trust myself exactly yeah yeah and i have actually had clients say to me if i give them a verbal validation they look at me and go what do you want and i go i do not want anything i'm just yeah you must want something because that's the only reason anybody ever validates me and it's like wow that's so they cannot even trust words at all anymore gosh i did not even i did not even think about that until you said that and that's so true that was definitely something that i struggled with is is entrusting people are you saying that to me because you really like me because with me i also had a very deep deep belief system that nobody loved me because i was told that and believed it so your words are going to be an act absolutely nothing even i was suspicious of the actions just because of where i was at yeah yeah but i but i did what i did do is stop looking outwards for my validation and start validating myself and it's been you are right it is a process because i'm still learning i'm learning today look at this yeah so like a very simple term like one of the things that we encourage people to do is just make lists of what they like about themselves what they do not and initially always the list of what they do not is very long and what they like is one or two things or even nothing but then begin to kind of really focus on seeing themselves accurately because there is a bunch of positives that either you are refusing to see or nobody's ever acknowledged before so you do not acknowledge it to yourself but do that exercise then ask people that you do trust as safe to do that list on you and see what they say and you may not initially want to trust it but but but let yourself kind of venture into the risk of trusting that these people do care there's no ulterior motive and they are just giving me honest feedback and gradually you can break down some of the defenses that you have built and because for many people they long for validation but they are it's almost like they are waterproof to validation people can pour validation on them it's just like water off a duck's back it does not penetrate because they got so many defenses that i'm not worthy of this i'm bad everybody's uses words to manipulate me so and so it's it's starting to open up that waterproofing just a little wee bit and then it gradually expands from there but you got to start somewhere you do and one of the things that i have been doing recently that you know and i know so many of us survivors do is we tend to look at the past and look at all of our mistakes and the things that we screwed up on and i am notorious for doing that and i'm still forgiving myself for some of the stuff that you know my behavior was but i'm now looking at the things i did right exactly i I'm shocked.",
