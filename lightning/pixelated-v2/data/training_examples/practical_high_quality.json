The minute you get into the car the radio goes on or you are texting when you should not be and all of that kind of stuff and then you are on the phone and you get home the TV's on you are playing video games and if you have to sit there your legs just the bouncing because you cannot your antsy you cannot live with yourself and so you need constant distractions because living in your own skin is terrible existence okay that's how we the first thing their second priority is to hide now the what we do from there is this nobody wants to walk around feeling like they do not have any value there's something in us that is driven to I want to feel valuable I want to feel that I have importance so we begin to try and create things that give us a sense of feeling important and everybody's different in what they do but let me give you some of the things that people do to try to deal with their shame and try to feel value if you were born to be one of those people that just naturally has a very beautiful face and a very beautiful body you probably if you are a girl you are probably in school had a lot of guys asking you out for dates a lot of guys drooling over you and and and you are looking around and saying nobody else is getting this kind of attention huh I'm pretty hot well that just makes me feel valuable so now what has happened in your mind is my value does not come from Who I am or my character my value comes from my body and my looks and so now what do you have an obsession about I have to maintain this body and then when you get 40 and 50 you are having major crises because it's getting harder to do all the nips and tucks and maintain the body the thing that gave you value is disappearing but you see how that works some go well I might not have as hot a body as Miss hottie over there but I can get more guys to sleep with me than she can and I'm better in bed and so I'm going to use my promiscuity my ability in bed to start keeping track that I have got more people that I have slept with and I am hotter in bed that's my value and if you grow with that and all of a sudden you come into recovery and you go I think I need to change a lot of my sexual behavior that's a crisis because now you are going well then what will give me value because that was the source of my value huge issue some you just get the money and the possessions and you use that to get a lot of money and you could have give you a sense of value or your position your career that becomes what gives you a sense of value and that if that's the case for you that's why retirement is a huge crisis for somebody because now they are not working and that's what gave them value and so now who are they they were not a human being before they were a human doing and now that they are not doing they do not have a sense of value a big issue some people get into religion and they are going to be the best person in that religion and they will get their value from that others are say you know I cannot compete in any of those arenas I do not stand a chance but man I can be bad so I'm going to be the baddest of the bad and that will give me my sense of value but you want to know what happens when you go down that road of finding value it seems to be working but it always leaves you having to prove yourself every time a new person moves into the school that's good looking all of a sudden you are I got to prove that I'm hotter than them and you got all of that and so you got insecurities start to happen jealousy all of those things it does not properly solve the value issue it does not properly solve the shame problem the next thing that some people do to try and get a sense of value is to go into relationships but the problem is is that shame always messes up those relationships so let me we are going to save this to go into detail in a couple weeks but let me just mention it very briefly a person in shame the worst thing to be is alone because if I'm all alone without being in a relationship well that seems to prove I'm not lovable nobody wants to be with me and so therefore the goal becomes I always have to be in a relationship and some of you understand that and if a relationship starting to fall apart you will not end it till you got another one ready to go so you can move from one to the other and so that becomes a very important thing I have to be in a relationship that proves and confirms I'm desirable and I'm not lovable and I'm lovable others what happens because of the shame is I long for intimacy but I'm scared of intimacy if I take this wall down and I let them in to start to know me I'm pretty sure they are going to abandon me and so you want to have an intimate relationship but you are afraid to you live with a fear that they are going to leave you and so that fear of abandonment causes you all kinds of games that you play in order to try and stop that or test them and then it causes all kinds of jealousy because what you are thinking is once they find out what I'm really like they are going to find somebody else because bottom line you feel you are not much of a catch where I like to put it this way you feel like you are chopped liver and I think we all have in success you always have a chance to shock yourself but I mean you do and it's in our character to move and things matter there is no doubt it do you know it usually it does not help if they only taken a beating it does it help if it makes you balls a bunch of makeup媽 and you know who this guy has was my Nearly two years something to flour go and say I'm sick I'm sick I'm dislocated but it's okay eventually we will get better yes but you have got to come back to yourself to understand you understand women when you voltage young for good now we see it's more self-reliant to love to control them so they do not leave you for that steak and and it gets really messy and it begins to break the relationship down the other thing that happens is when you have shame you always end up feeling inferior and so you are thinking is if I could just feel superior then that would be the answer to my shame and so most relationships of people with shame are people who are always inferior superior somebody's always trying to be better than the other and you want to know something you cannot have a healthy intimate relationship if those are the dynamics and we will look at that in more detail and so the sad result of all of the shame is it messes up relationship but what is interesting and I still do not know that we have a perfect way of explaining it but a shame person always seems to attract other shame people some people will say to me all the time why do I always attract losers then they are beautiful people in many ways but it's because there's shame and a person with shame is an antennas out there that says oh I can smell another person with shame and I know the dynamics for how that those relationship work and then before you know it you are in a relationship that starts out like it's the most wonderful relationship in the world because you both have got masks on and as soon as those masks are coming off and the real person comes out it's World War three and it's not a pretty sight okay let me end with this how do you begin to heal from shame it's one thing to understand it to analyze the problem but where do you go to start to change that my hope for everybody here if you grew up with a distorted mirror that said you are four feet tall and four feet wide is that someday you can look at an accurate mirror that says you are six feet tall and thin and say that's the truth I believe it but that is a journey to get there and so let me just say this there's a couple basics I'm not going to expand on it I'm just going to give them to you quickly but number one hang around healthier people who will be more accurate mirrors that will reflect to you and a more accurate picture about your value and how lovable you are here's why I emphasize that what happens for many people in recovery is they are afraid to make new relationships with people so they go back to old friends or they go back to unhealthy family and you want to know what going back to unhealthy family is it's not healthy family it's not healthy family it's not healthy family it's going back to a distorted mirror and so you could be in treatment I have seen this happen over and over where you are starting to feel better about yourself you are starting to heal from your shame and you go home to visit family and mum raises an eyebrow and makes a comment and all of a sudden you feel like that person has no value and is a pain and a burden and not good enough it all comes rushing back and so you need to begin to think about putting up to heal and then starting to revive and try to make the choices that are important to Бойти Lavender.",

shaking and then you can just be constantly agitated you cannot sit still you cannot calm yourself your legs jiggling all the time then you can just be sweating a lot way more than normal that happens with people you can then start having panic attacks that come out of nowhere some go to either constipation or diarrhea it just throws off their whole gastrointestinal system some insomnia or they just want to sleep all the time some they get startled really easily the slightest little thing and they jump others find their blood pressure goes up or they have a racing heartbeat others all of a sudden you get you get a little bit of a panic attack and then you can just be sweating a lot way more than normal you get aches and pains you get muscle tension you get inflammation all of a sudden that happens or you get migraines headaches that you do not normally get or you are just tired all the time so you can sleep all the time or you cannot sleep at all but you are tired all the time so those are some of the physical symptoms that can happen right after you realize you have been betrayed that leads to behavioral symptoms that often happen with people that have been Freshly betrayed so I just want to isolate from people I cannot face anybody I do not want to have to explain I do not want to have to talk so I'm going to isolate and then crying frequently just cannot stop crying decreasing self-care do not take care of yourself do not shower do not eat properly do not sleep properly all of that can happen do not do the things that you used to do as healthy self-care or escapes healthy hobbies you just cannot work as much and so there's a decrease in your work productivity there's an increase or decrease in your eating we have talked about that for some there's an increase in aggressiveness in reactivity the person says the slightest little thing to you and you go into attack mode and you lash out that can happen others just spend all their time on social media that just numbs them out they just scroll through page after page of social media others go into just buying stuff and so they make all kinds of unnecessary purchases it's a way of numbing it's a way of getting out of that pain for a while so others go to alcohol and drugs it's a way of numbing it's a way of getting out of the pain some go to reckless behavior they drive radically they all of a sudden do stuff that potentially is quite risky they could die but part of them does not care if I die I die and so they are increased there's an increase in risky behavior then there's relationships symptoms that come out of it and they are more long term for people so they have been betrayed now they are looking at starting a relationship again just a friendship it's not necessarily romantic could be but it's not necessarily but all of a sudden they find that they are struggling to open up they are struggling with any kind of deeper intimacy that just scares them they can even be suspicious of kindness so somebody's super kind to them and they go are they grooming me is there what do they want is there a hidden agenda here and so they have huge trust issues they do not know if they can ever trust again so they are suspicious of everything and then if they do get in a relationship they have difficulty maintaining that relationship every little thing the person does they overanalyze they look for negative they find the betrayal they pull away they test the other person and so they are they have difficulty maintain relationships and then if the other person is wanting to get closer and get to know them better they are not comfortable with that so they are kind of resisting that or pushing people away and then they can have Jealousy issues they start to get in a relationship and every time that belongs that person talks to somebody else they they are like I give them an insult anyway but the reason why more love is to get in that relationship and this has said a lot at least for some times the relationship and then another one of these relationships often are not focused that way they are like just five two three or five هنا it's hard to run and tell guys and their correspondents can around them just it's hard to keep your Benson rods and get out of prison the person that does the other person and they know that tied off fighting real estate and this is cum star smell all white and it stirs up stuff and they get super jealous and that can cause trouble and then they can have all have a odd oppositional defiance so they get in a relationship and the person says i think you should do this or here's what i think we should do and it's almost like something is triggered inside of them that i want to do the opposite i am not going to follow anybody's advice i'm not going to trust anybody's advice i have to make all my decisions by myself then for some now when they get in a relationship to them if i'm not going to be betrayed by you and i'm going to be able to trust you then we there can be no boundaries you can never say no to me you can never say you need some personal space and so they resist boundaries and boundaries to them proves you are not loyal you do not love me you do not care care.",

Or you had a parent who was so focused on looking good, their image, that negative emotions like a child crying, a child being afraid, a child habeas 컷 having a need and expressing it was perceived as weakness it made them look bad as a parent that they were not doing their job so they shamed you and made you feel guilty for crying or showing fear or you had a parent who was great with all the other kids in the neighborhood and was was always spending time doing fun stuff with them but did not seem to have time for you or you had a parent who parentified you who relied on you for emotional support instead of relying on their spouse and so now you cannot have a problem where you have to rely on them or when you ask the parent for something they made it all about them they then went do not you know how busy I am do not you know how much many responsibilities I have do not you know how difficult it is to be a parent and how difficult it is to be a parent and how difficult my life is all of a sudden it became all about them or you had a parent who never tried to understand you and your needs never got you or you had a parent who without you even realizing it made you feel invisible wanted you to not have needs encouraged you validated you for not having needs they made you they made you invisible so you had to be unseen and unheard or parents who made a child a hero and that child always had to be super responsible could never have needs but had to meet the needs of others or you had a parent that expected you to learn a new skill the first time you attempted it and you had to do it perfectly the first time if you did not if you failed if you did a so-so job they became impatient with you or you had a parents that said you only need family you do not need anybody else and you should not need anybody else or you had parents who taught you do not tell others about our family problems we do not air our dirty laundry so you just keep all those negative things inside of you and never share them with anybody or you had a parent who always played the victim who was always super needy it was always poor me oh i had got a bad headache today oh i'm feeling depressed today oh i'm feeling so tired today and you hated having a parent like that and were determined so get some rest upon your cadaver if you could share some Vänern sáti now if you have never taught about what is detachment so or your dad was so exhausted by the end of the day they could hardly move off the couch and you never wanted to bother them or final one you had a parent who always had something new they complained about some new problems some new illness some new stress in their life so if you had a parent like that I hope you can see you would end up feeling like a burden because of what that parent communicated but then there's some other scenarios that could create this for you as a child if you had parents who were both playing the victim a narcissist and enabler and you had to try to parent your siblings you had to parent your up your parents you had to be the responsible one in the family then you were caring for everybody else's needs but you could not have needs of your own or if you had a family where there's constant fighting conflict anger tension often a child thinks the way to help my family is to not have needs because when I have needs it just creates more anger and tension or maybe you were a child who was a burden because you had a chronic illness you were a sick child and you saw the toll it took on your parents and you never want to be that to anybody else today so those all feed into an attitude that says I never want to be a burden but what happens if you adopt that attitude and you do not want to be a burden and you do not want to be a burden and you do not want to be a burden that is because the burden is in your attitude well you burn yourself out you realize we need people we were made to be self-sufficient totally independent and so what happens by not putting any of your needs on others but putting all your needs on yourself you add to your own burden and you end up burning yourself out and then that can lead to depression that can lead to a deep loneliness feeling that nobody cares about my life that can feed shame nobody cares about me I must I'm not good enough I'm failing I'm a loser and that can take people into just feeling what's the point and then it leads to a relapse so people who are afraid to ask for help and want to try to do it all by themselves often set themselves up to fail and that can lead to relapse for many but more than that one of the reasons we have needs is because it drives us to connect with people and its connection with people that is the core piece in being healthy and so if I try to be independent and never connect with people I'm not going to be able to do it because I'm afraid to do it and I'm not going to be able to connect with anybody I can end up with major mental health issues due to that lack of connection I can end up with physical health issues due to that lack of connection due to the extra stress I put on myself so it can lead to mental health it can lead to physical health issues it can lead to what somebody has said the fear of burdening another person has prevented me from letting anyone close to my heart or even into my life.",

Families are spread all over and children are being raised just by the primary caretakers, caregiver there's not that village in extended family anymore to help in the raising of the child so all those things go together to create this mindset of I got to be strong I got to do this myself I cannot rely on others because our society is so fractured and families are all over and I'm not close to anybody and it sets us up to become very unhealthy so let's move to the healing stuff the change so what I do not want you to hear is I need to go out now and tell everybody my needs I want to start with a caution you should only tell people about your needs if they are safe people because if you tell an unsafe person about your needs it could be disastrous it could reinforce all of the things that you heard growing up that made you feel like a burden so let me say this a narcissist if you were to tell them your needs at first they would be so caring so giving they would be there to help you over and over until it was not fun for them anymore and then they would change on you and then they would start to accuse you of being selfish and it would be disastrous for you or you could tell another unsafe unsafe person your needs and what that for them means is I will help you but you now owe me and you are now in my debt and you do not want that or you could tell an unsafe person your needs and what they are hearing is you want me to meet your needs but now I am going to try and run your life for you I will be my self-appointed mentor of you and teacher of you and I will now meddle in your life so be very careful that you do not choose unsafe people to tell your needs too but then understand this you will go to safe people and for the most part they will meet your need and that will be kind of a new experience for you but some safe people at times are going to have to say to you sorry I cannot meet your need today and you are going to feel all your old stuff triggered nobody cares about me see I'm a burden to everybody and it's going to make you want to run and shut down and never ask anybody again so understand this when somebody says no or sets a boundary that's going to trigger your limbic brain but get out of that into your cortex and go okay did they say no because I'm a burden or because they just have too much on their plate right now process through it so that you do not go down the old ways in your mind and in your behaviors be aware of this of a tendency you might have in yourself some people they are afraid to ask people for help they are afraid to express their needs because they are afraid people say no so what they do is they create a crisis and everybody comes running and then they go see I did not need to tell anybody my needs I just need to create a crisis and all of a sudden they are little drama producers chaos producers crisis producers here's what happens people come running for a while but then they catch on to what you are doing and they stop coming and then you begin to go okay that's not working anymore but I'm still afraid to ask for help.",

    "text": "Well welcome back we started a couple weeks ago a study of the life of one of my favorite Bible characters Joseph he's known for saving the world and Israel from this famine that took place many years ago but what I want us to understand is Joseph experienced a tremendous amount of trauma both within his family and outside of his family and last two weeks we have been looking at kind of the unhealthy stuff within his family there was a lot of sick stuff going on there today I want you to see the the main traumas that came out of his family and it is quite heartbreaking and many of you will have experienced it but let me start with the very first thing as we read about Joseph it says this in Genesis 37 this is the account of Jacob and his family when Joseph was 17 years old he often tended his father's flocks he worked for his half brothers the sons of his father's wives Bella and zilpa but Joseph reported to his father some some of the bad things his brothers were doing so the very first word we are given of Joseph saying something he's ratting out his brothers he's telling his dad what they are doing when they are way off in the distance taking care of the sheep and it's some very bad stuff now some people look at this and and see Joseph in a negative light he's he's a rat a tattletale but I think the reason we are told this about Joseph is to show that no this is not a weakness in Joseph this is a strength Joseph from a young boy has a character that says I want what is right I want to love people I want to treat people properly with respect and when I see my brothers hurting people doing things that are wrong I want to stop that and so we see that from a young boy as a matter of fact he grew up in a family where there's all kinds of sexual perversion where there's all kinds of anger hatred hurting each other Joseph as a young boy says I want to live by love I want to do what is right and so we see this amazing young man developing who's committed to living by God's design to live by a healthy standard it's a beautiful thing to see but then we get this because of what Joseph did and then a couple other things that we are going to see now Jacob loved Joseph more than any of his other children because Joseph had been born to him in his old age his father favors him over the other children so one day Jacob had a special gift made for Joseph a beautiful robe so for some of you growing up in Sunday school this was referred to as the coat of many colors we do not know for sure what that the the Hebrew word means in referring to this robe but there's basically two things that seem clear by Joseph wearing this robe that his father gave him what Jacob was saying was number one Joseph you do not have to work like your brothers you do not have to work as hard number two you are going to get the main part of the inheritance even though you are one of the youngest of the children you are going to get special treatment so what happens his brothers hated Joseph because their father loved him more than them so they respond out of anger and hatred to Joseph this favorite this pet they could not say a single kind word to him so Joseph is bullied Joseph is constantly having his brothers take shots at him say hurtful things to him beat him up do other hurtful things to him he is constantly being bullied and put down a very very difficult thing for a young boy to grow up in and many of you have grown up in it and then we are told this one night Joseph had a dream and when he told his brothers about it they hated him more than ever so what is this dream he says listen to this dream he said we were on the field tying up bundles of grain suddenly my bundle stood up and your bundles all gathered around and bowed low before me in other words Joseph is saying one day you guys are going to bow before me now I think what Joseph is trying to do here is say brothers it's right that dad's favoring me because I will someday be over you I will someday rule you someday you will admire me and bow before me out of reverence I think he's trying to help them get over their hatred help them to accept his favored positions but we are told his Brothers hated him all the more respond so you think you will be our king do you do you actually think you will reign over us and they hated him all the more because of his dreams and he had a second dream and he told them about it and by the way he talked about them soon Joseph had another dream and again he told his brothers and about it and he listened I had another dream and the sun and the moon and the 11 stars bowed low before me.",

I can, basically use and abuse people and everybody bows to me and I get a wonderful life why bother changing so the more you enable a narcissist by making more sacrifices giving them one more chance the more you are just feeding their belief that they do not need to change they are not going to change unless you take away the benefits that they have of being a narcissist and that means you stop enabling that means that you no longer play their game so understand that that is so important next thing many narcissists will act like they want to change but they really do not but they act like they want to change in order to give you false hope so that you will not get rid of them so that you will continue to play the game so here's some of the things that a narcissist will do to give you false hope they will agree to go to counseling with you you have confronted them you have just had a blow up you say we need help unless you go to counseling it's over with they will go to counseling with you and you have hope but what happens in the counseling you have hope but what happens in the counseling you have hope is as a narcissist they are very smooth they are very charming they are very logical they get the counselor on their side they convince the counselor that you are the problem that they are the sane one and they can spin a picture that the counselor believes and pretty soon what has happened is you feel ambushed because now the counselor is on the side of the narcissist against you as the problem it backfires big time another thing that they will do is they will take a course so they could take our lift course they could take read books on relationships read books on trauma take a course on trauma and you get your hopes up oh they want to learn they want to learn well not for the reasons you think they do not want to learn so they can change they do not want to learn so they can see what they are doing they want to learn so they learn the language so they know how to use it as a weapon against you so they know how to twist it so that they can now play with your thinking and distort your thinking and get you to see that it's your problem that happens so often that you are not ama-ing when you have the right to act for the surgery you know if you have a clear body the feeling of transforming and showing confidence or motivation is going to constantly be the same as if it was a broken heart or flơn we want to be so used to listening to the same let's be Fred with Answers if you think it's what you are looking forward to you will be well in a second thanks s H O T A B E S them talk through problems a bit more communicate a bit more to calm them down and as soon as everything's kind of smoothed over and calmed down then they regress back to their old behaviors so they do not change their core issues they make a few surface band-aid changes to calm you down and get you off their back so that's another tactic that they would do now i need to point out that a lot of people when they raise this with me they think that the solution would be to go to their narcissist partner and say i'm not happy i'm doing all the work here i am changing you are not doing anything you are not looking at your stuff and they think if i just have a very open clear discussion with them where i communicate very clearly that they will hear me and they will go oh you are right i never thought of that okay yep i see you are doing all the work i need to start changing and they will own it all they need is you to say it clearly enough to convince them but you want to what usually happens with them it does not work like you thought it would you have this wonderful discussion and they take what you say and tell you to put it into your vehicle so they do not tell you anything about that i will be shocked so everybody put your haar down and say okay my department about this damn random talk what's going on with this i really do not want to have conversation about it i do not really you do not'm and twist it to make you the bad guy.",
