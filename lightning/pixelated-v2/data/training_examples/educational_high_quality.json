    "text": "Go into some of the ramifications of the solutions the brain comes up with so the brain develops solutions that it thinks are going to fix the problem but it's limbic brain stuff it just makes things feel a little bit better but it makes things worse in the long run so here are some of the very early adaptations or solutions the brain proposes for the shame thing how to get love and respect but remain hidden so number one never be vulnerable never be authentic never let people see the parts of you that would make you weak so do not let them see you cry because then they might look down on you do not let them see you sad because then they might think less of you so now you have to hide those weak emotions not just your personality but those emotions that can creep out and then once there are people might think less of you so that's the first solution with that you then put on mass so they cannot see the real me so I need to present to them something that they will like or respect I have to do an act or a role that they will say wow I like that person I want to be with her that person and so you become a mask wearer some of you relate to being a chameleon you wear a mask a different mask for each person you meet you know how to adjust your behavior to get this person to like you and how to make a different adjustment to get this person to like you you are very good at wearing masks we teach about the roles that children develop as they grow up so you talk about the hero and the jester and the invisible child and the scapegoat child i want you to think those about those roles in terms of shame because one of the purposes of those roles is not just to help the family have less pain it's to provide a solution to shame so the hero child says they cannot see the real me mom and dad because they will reject me they will neglect me so i will be a hero i will be super responsible i will never cause problems i will do extra chores i will be cooperative with everything they want i will never rebel i will help out then mom and dad will love me and respect me so the child is trying to get love and respect within the family while hiding what they think are defects the second child is that invisible child that says i do not want to be a burden to mom and dad that's why they do not like me that's why they abuse me and neglect me so i will have zero needs i will never ask for anything i will never share with them my dreams or desires or wants because then i might be a burden so i have to somehow fade into the wallpaper and then i'm going to be a burden and have zero needs or desires then maybe mom and dad will say that's a good kid and they will respect me and love me so still trying to solve shame then the jester child or the comedian says i will hide behind humor people will not see the real me mom and dad will never see the sad parts of me the parts of me that are painful and might be a burden to them them laugh all the time I will make them so they are always wanting to be with me and have me around because I just make life fun and enjoyable and everybody's happy trying to solve their shame so that is one way to look at the roles another thing that happens naturally in the brain is this if I am perfect people will love me and respect me if I please everybody people will love me and respect me so I will not let them see the real me I will just be a perfectionist or people pleaser and then I will get the love and the respect that I long for and you see the flaw in this you get immediate love and respect but what goes on in your head you go you are being a phony if they knew the real you they would have been a fool if they knew the real you they would have been a fool and be loving you and respect you so this whole thing is getting you love and respect and it feels good but it does not satisfy because you know it's an act and so that becomes the problems of this another solution the brain proposes is I must lie about who I really am I must lie about things that I do that I think might get me judged I must keep secrets about struggles I have and I must keep secrets about the things that I do that I think might get me judged I must keep secrets about struggles I have and I must keep secrets about struggles I have failures I have because I have to hide and so to hide effectively I have to become a good liar and I have to become a good secret keeper so again you can see that might work in getting people to like you and respect you but it sure is not going to make a healthy relationship down the road if you keep lying and keeping secrets all the time it's going to backfire sooner or later other people say I will build walls around my heart so some people isolate geographically who who wants to risk relationships with people when you got shame because you they are going to find you out eventually so I'm not even going to go there I'm going to have zero relationships I'm going to become an isolator some do that not many but some do others say I want to be with people but I'm going to isolate by creating walls and what they do is they let you in a little bit but then you can just feel you bump into a wall and they are not going to let you know anything further about them they are not going to let the relationship go any deeper you can bang your head against that wall all you want but they are not going to let you in they are isolating behind walls others say my internal world is shame I'm not valuable I'm not good enough all of those things so let's just make it a little bit more personal and let's just make it a little bit more personal and let's just make it a little bit more personal and make it better all I'm really not interested in it tough My first step is to
