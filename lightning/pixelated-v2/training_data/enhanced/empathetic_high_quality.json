    "text": "That's validation. Um, and somebody wants to connect with us that's validation, but that is kind of, Yeah. foreign territory for so many people yeah that's really validation yeah I mean that's what I'm really learning right here right now is just understanding the word validation and what it really means that it's not because you you know I've always thought it's just words well not just words but that's how I took it because I actually had a very dear friend I want to say validate me verbally for the first time in my life outside of therapy and I cannot tell you what that did for me but I love that you're sharing that it's the actions that when someone wants to connect with you that's validation when you're treating yourself well that's validation and so really starting with and you're so right about the self-awareness I preach about that all the time that you need to have self-awareness for this healing journey because that's what's really gonna help you out and and if you begin to just look at how you're treating yourself look at what's going on in your head and what you're allowing you know and and changing that yeah and if I can add one other piece to this so many kids in complex trauma validating words were actually forms of manipulation they always have a hidden agenda so I'm gonna say nice things about you to manipulate you to get I've got an ulterior motive for what I want you to do for me so that for me is what I've wanted you to do for me and so that's what's really key for me that for me is what I want you to do for me so that for me is what I've wanted many people as soon as they hear validating words they go i wonder what they really want oh yeah and there's a immediate on guard suspicion that words never mean what they really say there's always a hidden meaning and a hidden agenda and i'm immediately on guard and so that's where for most people they eventually need the healing power of words but they first need words are just too scary for them they need people to treat them with respect yeah that's so true yeah i uh in my first marriage there was a lot of words and not a lot of action or the actions didn't line up with the words and i cannot tell you how frustrating that is and it got to the point where i just i really got to the point where i didn't trust anybody what anybody had to say i didn't even trust myself exactly yeah yeah and i've actually had clients say to me if i give them a verbal validation they look at me and go what do you want and i go i don't want anything i'm just yeah you must want something because that's the only reason anybody ever validates me and it's like wow that's so they can't even trust words at all anymore gosh i didn't even i didn't even think about that until you said that and that's so true that was definitely something that i struggled with is is entrusting people are you saying that to me because you really like me because with me i also had a very deep deep belief system that nobody loved me because i was told that and believed it so your words are going to be an act absolutely nothing even i was suspicious of the actions just because of where i was at yeah yeah but i but i did what i did do is stop looking outwards for my validation and start validating myself and it's been you're right it is a process because i'm still learning i'm learning today look at this yeah so like a very simple term like one of the things that we encourage people to do is just make lists of what they like about themselves what they don't and initially always the list of what they don't is very long and what they like is one or two things or even nothing um but then begin to kind of really focus on seeing themselves accurately because there is a bunch of positives that either you're refusing to see um or nobody's ever acknowledged before so you don't acknowledge it to yourself but do that exercise then ask people that you do trust as safe to do that list on you and see what they say and you may not initially want to trust it but but but let yourself kind of venture into the risk of trusting that these people do care there's no ulterior motive um and they're just giving me honest feedback and gradually you can break down some of the defenses that you've built and because for many people they long for validation but they're it's almost like they're waterproof to validation people can pour validation on them it's just like water off a duck's back it doesn't penetrate because they got so many defenses that i'm not worthy of this i'm bad um everybody's uses words to manipulate me so and so it's it's starting to open up that waterproofing just a little wee bit and then it gradually expands from there but you got to start somewhere you do and one of the things that i've been doing recently that um you know and i know so many of us survivors do is we tend to look at the past and look at all of our mistakes and the things that we screwed up on and i am notorious for doing that and i'm still forgiving myself for some of the stuff that you know my behavior was but i'm now looking at the things i did right exactly i I'm shocked.",

    "text": "That's validation.  , and somebody wants to connect with us that's validation, but that is kind of, yes. Foreign territory for so many people yes that's really validation yes I mean that's what I am really learning right here right now is just understanding the word validation and what it really means that it's not because you you know I have always thought it's just words well not just words but that's how I took it because I actually had a very dear friend I want to say validate me verbally for the first time in my life outside of therapy and I cannot tell you what that did for me but I love that you are sharing that it's the actions that when someone wants to connect with you that's validation when you are treating yourself well that's validation and so really starting with and you are so right about the self-awareness I preach about that all the time that you need to have self-awareness for this healing journey because that's what's really going to help you out and and if you begin to just look at how you are treating yourself look at what's going on in your head and what you are allowing you know and and changing that yes and if I can add one other piece to this so many kids in complex trauma validating words were actually forms of manipulation they always have a hidden agenda so I am going to say nice things about you to manipulate you to get I have got an ulterior motive for what I want you to do for me so that for me is what I have wanted you to do for me and so that's what's really key for me that for me is what I want you to do for me so that for me is what I have wanted many people as soon as they hear validating words they go i wonder what they really want oh yes and there's a immediate on guard suspicion that words never mean what they really say there's always a hidden meaning and a hidden agenda and i am immediately on guard and so that's where for most people they eventually need the healing power of words but they first need words are just too scary for them they need people to treat them with respect yes that's so true yes i in my first marriage there was a lot of words and not a lot of action or the actions did not line up with the words and i cannot tell you how frustrating that is and it got to the point where i just i really got to the point where i did not trust anybody what anybody had to say i did not even trust myself exactly yes yes and i have actually had clients say to me if i give them a verbal validation they look at me and go what do you want and i go i do not want anything i am just yes you must want something because that's the only reason anybody ever validates me and it's like wow that's so they cannot even trust words at all anymore gosh i did not even i did not even think about that until you said that and that's so true that was definitely something that i struggled with is is entrusting people are you saying that to me because you really like me because with me i also had a very deep deep belief system that nobody loved me because i was told that and believed it so your words are going to be an act absolutely nothing even i was suspicious of the actions just because of where i was at yes yes but i but i did what i did do is stop looking outwards for my validation and start validating myself and it's been you are right it is a process because i am still learning i am learning today look at this yes so like a very simple term like one of the things that we encourage people to do is just make lists of what they like about themselves what they do not and initially always the list of what they do not is very long and what they like is one or two things or even nothing but then begin to kind of really focus on seeing themselves accurately because there is a bunch of positives that either you are refusing to see or nobody's ever acknowledged before so you do not acknowledge it to yourself but do that exercise then ask people that you do trust as safe to do that list on you and see what they say and you may not initially want to trust it but but but let yourself kind of venture into the risk of trusting that these people do care there's no ulterior motive and they are just giving me honest feedback and gradually you can break down some of the defenses that you have built and because for many people they long for validation but they are it's almost like they are waterproof to validation people can pour validation on them it's just like water off a duck's back it does not penetrate because they got so many defenses that i am not worthy of this i am bad everybody's uses words to manipulate me so and so it's it's starting to open up that waterproofing just a little wee bit and then it gradually expands from there but you got to start somewhere you do and one of the things that i have been doing recently that you know and i know so many of us survivors do is we tend to look at the past and look at all of our mistakes and the things that we screwed up on and i am notorious for doing that and i am still forgiving myself for some of the stuff that you know my behavior was but i am now looking at the things i did right exactly i I am shocked.",

related concepts validation or our need for validation and control and so let's start with validation what is this validation is when we get the message that we're okay we need validation to feel good about ourselves but we don't necessarily need validation from every person and that's one of the places that a lot of us make mistakes is that we want to be loved and approved of by everybody all the time well get over it it ain't going to happen you're not even going to approve of yourself all the time but one of the steps or one of the things that you can do in order to ensure that you're getting the validation that you need is to a make sure that you self validate you look at yourself and you say i'm okay i'm a good person you know i make mistakes i'm not perfect but i'm a good person and also surround yourself with significant others who validate you they may not say it and remember when we talk about love languages you know sometimes people communicate their validation and caring not necessarily by words but by acts of service or by giving gifts or spending quality time with you if they want to spend time with you that's validating it means they enjoy being around you so we do need to you know be a little bit more open to the concept of validation we also need to know how we experience how we prefer to experience validation because you know even though people are not necessarily by their nature going to communicate that way we can nudge them in that direction we can let them know how we experience love what our love languages are and that will help them be able to more effectively validate us so for me for example one of my top love languages is acts of service so when people do nice things when my kids i come home and they've done an extra good job cleaning the house i'm just i'm just i'm just like oh my gosh thank you so much that is very validating to me it validates that they respect me and they care about me as a person i'm not big on gifts you know that's not one of those things so you need to know how you experience validation and be able to communicate that to others so they can communicate to you in your love language otherwise if you're speaking two different languages you're probably going to have an impasse we also need to look at from whom we need validation and why and this is a big question we need validation from other people it's true we need to feel like we're loved and we're accepted by people but not everybody so i want you to think about who in your life you need validation from is it your kids is it your significant other is it your parents you know who is it and why you know what what would happen you know just hypothetically what would happen if one of those people that you you quote need validation from didn't give it to you does it make you less of a person does it make you less okay as a person you know sometimes you know i'll take parents for example sometimes parents aren't going to agree with the decisions their kids make and they're not going to validate those decisions but we want to separate number one we want to separate them not validating decisions from not validating us you know if i make a decision that my parents didn't agree with or when i did you know they were very clear they didn't agree with that decision but they loved me and they supported me anyway which was validating they you know may not agree with the choice i was making they may think it was downright a mistake but they loved me and supported me anyway so you want to separate validation of actions from validation of the decision that you made and of person for one and number two remember that not everybody is going to be able to for one reason or another validate you all the time so you need to be able to validate yourself if they don't agree with it or if they're not providing the attention and quality time and validation that you need all right where can you get it from you know so don't put all your eggs in one basket rely on other people know that you've got other friends that are there to support you even if one friend is kind of flaking out right now do we need validation from our higher power and if you're a spiritual person you may you may want to believe that your higher power approves of you so again you need that's a relationship that nobody else is taking part in so you need to be able to have a good communication with that higher power or a feeling in your head heart and gut that says i am doing right by my higher power and i'm making my higher power proud of me if that is a validation that you need and we do need validation from ourselves in order to get love respect validation from other people we have to be able to love respect and validate ourselves so you need to look in the mirror and go I'm a good person practice that when you start criticizing yourself and a lot of us get caught up with these self-deprecating comments about you know i'm stupid i'm not good at that i'm whatever knock that off you know that's maybe you made a mistake that's okay but you're still a good person and be able to appreciate yourself for who you are then you're not going to need other people to always validate you because if they're not able to do it because they're caught up with their own stuff or they just are mad at you for some reason or whatever that's okay you know that's their right you don't have to have them to tell you that it's okay that you breathe the air you need to be able to validate yourself so what does validation look like we keep talking about this word but what is it you can have your feelings validated and for a lot of us who are feelers if you go to the myers-briggs um we need to have when we feel upset or something we need to have you know we need to have your feelings and they're about to come to the right way they have to have your feelings in place if you have to have them in place that is okay that's our feelings validated we need to have somebody say i can see that you're really angry or i can see that you're really scared they may not agree they don't have to feel the same but if they're identifying how we feel and they're going i got you i'm sensing that you feel this way that can be enough now do they have to agree with our feelings if we say yes then we're going to set ourselves up for a world to hurt because we can't control how other people feel we need to accept that we feel how we feel based on our experiences my experiences are very different than my friends experiences so where where something might stress me out you know it may not stress her out and there are some things that stress her out that don't bother me a bit and you know i understand for example she is terrible fight of paper wasps and i love the little buggers they're they're great beneficial insects they're really docile but i can understand her fear of them and so you know i validate the fact that she's afraid of them and and you know i respect that i don't say oh well you know poo just get over it it's not that easy you know i wish she could see how cute they were but that's not how she's wired so i'm not saying that she's afraid of them but i'm saying that she's afraid of them and i'm not saying that she's afraid of them and i'm not saying that she's afraid of them and i'm not a little bit terrified of them and i'm not saying that she's afraid of them and i'm not so i recognize that is a part of her and i validate that um we want to validate people's thoughts and they're going to have different opinions my son has different opinions about things than i do um and you know i have different opinions than than my mother and etc and that's okay we want to validate their thoughts as you know their thoughts are valid your thoughts your opinions your feelings are valid for you they may not be valid for me but they are valid for you you're not forcing them to be what they're supposed to be but at some point that's okay you're not forcing and i respect you as a person and we need to have our being validated we need to be validated that we are lovable good people and that is independent of what we do and our feelings and our thoughts it's who we are we are good people that make mistakes that are fallible that yeah yada yada yada but we need to believe that we are lovable and we need to feel experience that other people believe that we are lovable and again it doesn't necessarily come from the people that every person that we want it to not everybody is going to validate your being and that's a lot a lot of times that has more to do with their stuff than than your stuff but if you let it destroy your self-esteem and your confidence and your mood and your energy then you're giving them power validate yourself say you know what i'm good enough i'm smart enough and gosh darn it people like me um and and move on and recognize all the other people in your life that validate who you are that person is just missing the boat and then tough diddlywinks for them and that's what we're doing and that's what we're doing and that's what we're doing so what are some reasons we may not get validation from other people well they may not agree or feel the same and they may be unwilling or unable to take our point of view some people have huge control issues it's either their way or the highway now remember i keep saying if they can't validate you it's probably more about them than about you well this is a perfect example if they are unwilling to respect your point of view or your feelings that's more about them if they're too immersed in their own stuff to be able to begin to understand your point of view whether it's you know whatever drama they've got going on in their life and they just don't have the emotional energy to pay attention to what's going on to you or to listen or to be there for you it doesn't mean it's about you it means it's their stuff is getting in the way so always take a step back and ask yourself is there some other reason besides me besides me being unvalidatable that this person may be acting this way and 99 of the time you're going to come up with a great big yes now why might we not get validation from ourselves well it's really hard to validate ourselves if we base our entire worth on what other people say do and think about us so if i feel like i'm a worthwhile person long as so and so likes me and as long as i'm in a relationship and as long as this and that and the other all of those things are involve other people and i can't control other people so if those other people are caught in their own stuff which a lot of us are these days then i may be out there kind of like flapping like a fish out of water if i can validate myself then i can catch my breath we can't validate ourselves if we don't appreciate ourselves and you know that whole self-love thing people kind of laugh at it and they're like oh that's so hokey but really you need to realize and call it whatever you want self-respect self-love self-honesty you need to look inside and go i'm a good person because and one of the ways that i have clients do this sometimes is go online and find a list of values and if you put in like the top 100 values or something you can get all kinds of values lists and it'll say things like honesty and integrity and compassion and yada yada and go through that list and highlight all of the values that represent you and then go back over that list and highlight the top five that really characterize who you are that you're not different and really define who you are and how you feel about yourself and how that is real. know if you were heaven forbid you were to die today they would put on your epitaph she was caring compassionate loyal you know i sound like a dog at this point but um you want to identify those things that way you can recognize them in yourself and go what and and say to yourself you know what i'm pretty awesome i'd like to be my friend because that's what validation is it's being your own best friend and you may not validate yourself if you were taught that we are that you are only lovable if somebody else says you are and again that goes back to relying on other people to get their head out of their own stuff and focus on us that's pretty self-centered isn't it so we've got to realize they've got other stuff going on they've got their life and they may not agree with us whatever they've got their stuff and we've got our stuff we all have stuff but we need to be able to look at ourselves independent of our stuff and say i'm lovable i'm a good person so i encourage you to start working on that today identify five characteristics five values whatever you want to call them that make you a really awesome friend person whatever and focus on those for the next week to realize that you are a good person and that you are a good person and that you are a good therapist for all those things seeing how能cro as us high focus in a moment all right working on your self chaining into the bodyrasp://issue modindi mindset pain calling out so responsible for how to

sharing sticks timings할 forums community tools the videos content search and fewer results easy direction but better guess what works for you how to grab your model team first focus on how to get your social relationships and and validation and everything we need to recognize that letting go and forgiveness can be very scary and if we rely on that other person to validate us then letting go can be terrifying because if I let go of that person who validates me then who's going to do it maybe I'll have a place to be so we want to be able to recognize that it's important to be able to validate ourselves so that if somebody leaves our life we don't feel like we're going to disappear forgiveness can be scary because it means letting go of anger it means letting go of hostility it doesn't mean forgetting and forgiveness is really a power play letting go means choosing not to waste your energy fighting against something you can't control or is not worth your energy so again going back to a bad relationship for example if you're in a bad relationship and that person is not validating you that person is not making you feel like your uber self they're dragging you down in some way shape or form and it's just it's oil and water it may not be the best relationship to stay in but letting go is hard number one because you know what to expect with that person and you don't know when you're going to find somebody else and dating is a hassle and all that but letting go is a choice you make in order to be true to yourself inside your own your own head your brain and your heart are telling you this is a bad thing this is not where you need to be this is not a good situation for you when you say it yourself and you say you're right this is not a good situation for me I need to get out oh my gosh how liberating is that but then that means you've got to let go that means you've got to let that person go to the curb and be okay with that and choose not to waste your energy fighting against you know trying to change them not waste your energy trying to make them into something they're not we cannot change other people we can help them see things we can suggest that we would like to see some changes but unless they want to make those changes they ain't going to make them we can't change other people so when we let go we're saying you know what I'm done I tried as hard as I can and it's time for me to move on because if I validate my my own thoughts and my own feelings I know that the right move for me is to move on forgiveness means letting go of the hurt and resentment that's draining your energy so you can move forward to what's important to you forgiveness is for you not them so if you're in a relationship that's not meeting your needs and you know you're frustrated with that person because you feel like they're just they're not trying you feel like they're undermining you you feel like they're not validating you whatever it is you know you can get really frustrated at you're not doing this you're not done you're done iPad open the door there's no time to like dropped are up let go okay go ahead let's get together okay30 are resist all right you're not done you're done the doing this okay they're not what are you doing what do you need to do forgiveness is accepting that they either made a mistake or they did something that was unacceptable and you know you identified it or they're not willing to change and you need to be willing to forgive them because that unleashes that energy if you stay angry at them for not changing then when you get into your next relationship you're still carrying that baggage with you and you're probably still back in the back of your mind looking for this next person to do the same thing and the next person after that so forgive that person so you know what you had you were too stuck in your own stuff I'm not going to forget I'm not going to go back there but I'm going to forgive you because it's not worth it I'm not going to go back there but I'm going to forgive you because it's not worth it worth me staying angry over what you did or didn't do for me and I'm going to move forward so letting go and forgiveness are things that we generally can only do when we start validating ourselves so can you get validation and have control at the same time well not everybody's going to validate you it's it's not their job to make you feel okay your job is to make you feel okay but there's generally you generally will always have some people that you will that will validate you you know whether it's your parents or your best friend or whomever you're generally going to have someone that will validate you if you get hung up on why a particular person won't validate you ask yourself why do I care you know if this particular person is just not getting with your program why are you why are you beating your head against a wall for that why do you keep going after something that isn't clearly not going to resolve the way you want a lot of times this is because you're trying to relive something from the past and you're trying to quote get it right this time so if you've been in a bad relationship and you get into another relationship that's similar you may be trying to make this one work out correctly a lot of times people will redo things subconsciously trying to succeed trying to fix it this time another question you can ask yourself is why am I trying to control this person why is it worth my energy to try to convince them to do all the things that I want the way I want why why do I need to do that there are millions of other people out there what is it about this person and what parts of this situation do I have control over because maybe the person's not doing what you wanted them to do because you haven't clearly communicated all right well that you have control over maybe the person isn't doing what you want them to do because they don't want to well you don't have control over that so then you can the part you have control over is whether you choose to stay in that relationship and stay in that situation if it is not growth producing if it is hurting you instead of enhancing you when you're in relationships when things happen and you're feeling like you need validation and people aren't doing what you want it can be a really icky place to be so practice psychological flexibility identify to yourself that you're feeling empty you're feeling unloved you're feeling however you're feeling and then ask yourself what things can I do starting right know to improve the next moment what would make me happy you know what things can I do what do I have control over can you get enough sleep can you go out and exercise can you hang out with some different friends um you know what is it that you can do to improve your next moment instead of staying stuck spinning your wheels it's like a car stuck in the mud and you're just spinning your wheels and throwing mud and digging deeper into it if you try to fight this other situation try to fight and get somebody to do something that they are just not going to do and develop hardiness commitment control and challenge and we're going to focus mainly on commitment remember every single morning when you wake up and every night before you go to bed kind of do an inventory of all the awesome things in your life what's going for you what good things do you have in your life yeah you know you're gonna have some things that are not going the best you know nobody has a perfect life all the time that's okay but too often we get stuck focusing on those things that aren't going the best and then we start feeling unlovable and unsuccessful and un everything so it's important to remember all of it's important to remember all of it's important to remember all of it's important to remember all of the things that you've got going for you the friends that you have the things that are going right in your life and that will help you keep moving forward and remember you know commitment be committed to those values that make you such a lovable awesome person because if you're exuding awesomeness other people are going to gravitate towards you if you are kind and compassionate and caring and intelligent and you know whatever the things are that make you who you are other people who value those qualities are going to gravitate towards you so it's just a matter of taking a breath and living authentically other things that you can do with psychological flexibility you can unhook from your thoughts so you know ending relationships and not going back can be really challenging especially if you have low self-esteem or codependency um you know there are a lot of reasons so one of the things to do when you get out of a relationship and you know you're tempted to try to go back and make up you're tempted to minimize what was going on and get back into the relationship a lot of times your brain is saying i can't live without that person and you may feel in your heart like a part of it's being ripped out and it kind of is and you feel like you can't take it well unhooking from your thoughts is a way of separating from that and instead of saying i can't take it say i'm having the thought that i can't take it i'm having the thought that i'm going to be alone forever and then work through it because thoughts come and go you know let that thought go or replace it with another more accurate thought identify who and what is truly important in your life and acknowledge your feelings thoughts urges and behaviors in the present so if you're feeling lonely and isolated and defeated that's okay acknowledge it instead of fighting with it or ignoring it acknowledge it and then say what can i do to improve the next moment you can make two lists the first list is things that i do or think that help me move toward the important things in my life and review this list every day because these are things that you want to do to keep moving forward and the other list is things that i do or think that keep me stuck drain my forward energy or move me away from what is important and you know dwelling on things chasing after old loves you know there's a lot of things we do that waste our energy that could be used to move towards our goals so you have those two lists review the positive list every day that'll help you remember what you need to do to keep moving toward the important things like take care of your health you know if you want to be there for your kids because they're important well one of those ways to do that is to take care of your health so your live a long life and finally make a choice remember that when you feel a certain way you have control over how to use your energy so you can either you know spend the energy running after that person pleading with them to change and to take you back and to do all these things and probably not get anywhere and be back in the same place in a month or you can choose to do something different and live more authentically moving towards other people and things that are important in your life and acknowledge that that one while it had its benefits also had a lot of drawbacks and for your own health sanity and happiness you need to let it go so steps towards self-validation here are some exercises you can do identify the values and characteristics about yourself that make you awesome we talked about that one make a bill of rights and each item starts with item start with item pick and that's your what's your name what's your name you can't pick and deserve to i deserve to be happy i deserve to take a break i deserve to whatever keep that bill of rights going try to make 20 items that's going to make you really think by the time you get past 10 you really start having to think about you know what exactly do i deserve and if you can't think of all of them you know think about your kids for example and think about you know what do they deserve what do your kids deserve they deserve to be happy they deserve to be healthy they deserve to not be scared you know what else follow your bill of rights once you write it you got to follow it so remind yourself when you start doing things am i adhering to my own bill of rights identify the people in your past from whom whom you craved validation and never got it and explore why that may have been more about them than about you so if you wanted validation from one of your parents and you just could never seem to please that parent okay you know now that you're older and wiser and everything else let's look back and see if that was more about them and their frustrations or or their stuff than it was about you or maybe they actually did approve of you but they didn't know how to communicate it so you didn't feel valid even though they approved of you identify why you crave validation do you want to know that you're important and a lot of times if you're not able to self-validate then you need others to tell you you're okay and you're important if you can validate yourself then you don't crave validation from others make a list of people you know who fit the label that like the person that you want to be who is it that is important relevant and lovable in your life and identify how you're like those people so if you have a hard time identifying what's awesome about you look around at your friends and the people that you value and identify what's awesome about them and then go you know do i have that quality and a lot of times you're going to find that yeah you do have that quality or something similar so we've gone over you know kind of a broad spectrum and we're talking a lot about validation because the need for validation from other people is one of the reasons that many people stay in unhealthy relationships so we talked about why we may need validation how we can get validation how we can validate ourselves and then we talked a little bit about letting go of control and admitting that sometimes you know somebody else just can't or won't validate us but a lot of times that's because of their stuff and we can't fix that they have to be willing to fix that so we've got to be able to let go of control forgive them for not being willing to play by our playbook and move on and then we ended with exploring some psychological flexibility activities that we can do and we've been able to do that for a long time and i think that's a great way to start i think in order to learn about and and keep present in our mind how awesome we are and why we deserve love and respect if you like this podcast please subscribe on your favorite podcast app

    "text": "Hey there everybody and welcome to happiness is not brain surgery with doc snipes practical tools to improve your mood and quality of life today we are going to be talking about two sort of related concepts validation or our need for validation and control and so let's start with validation what is this validation is when we get the message that we are okay we need validation to feel good about ourselves but we do not necessarily need validation from every person and that's one of the places that a lot of us make mistakes is that we want to be loved and approved of by everybody all the time well get over it it ai not going to happen you are not even going to approve of yourself all the time but one of the steps or one of the things that you can do in order to ensure that you are getting the validation that you need is to a make sure that you self validate you look at yourself and you say i am okay i am a good person you know i make mistakes i am not perfect but i am a good person and also surround yourself with significant others who validate you they may not say it and remember when we talk about love languages you know sometimes people communicate their validation and caring not necessarily by words but by acts of service or by giving gifts or spending quality time with you if they want to spend time with you that's validating it means they enjoy being around you so we do need to you know be a little bit more open to the concept of validation we also need to know how we experience how we prefer to experience validation because you know even though people are not necessarily by their nature going to communicate that way we can nudge them in that direction we can let them know how we experience love what our love languages are and that will help them be able to more effectively validate us so for me for example one of my top love languages is acts of service so when people do nice things when my kids i come home and they have done an extra good job cleaning the house i am just i am just i am just like oh my gosh thank you so much that is very validating to me it validates that they respect me and they care about me as a person i am not big on gifts you know that's not one of those things so you need to know how you experience validation and be able to communicate that to others so they can communicate to you in your love language otherwise if you are speaking two different languages you are probably going to have an impasse we also need to look at from whom we need validation and why and this is a big question we need validation from other people it's true we need to feel like we are loved and we are accepted by people but not everybody so i want you to think about who in your life you need validation from is it your kids is it your significant other is it your parents you know who is it and why you know what what would happen you know just hypothetically what would happen if one of those people that you you quote need validation from did not give it to you does it make you less of a person does it make you less okay as a person you know sometimes you know i will take parents for example sometimes parents are not going to agree with the decisions their kids make and they are not going to validate those decisions but we want to separate number one we want to separate them not validating decisions from not validating us you know if i make a decision that my parents did not agree with or when i did you know they were very clear they did not agree with that decision but they loved me and they supported me anyway which was validating they you know may not agree with the choice i was making they may think it was downright a mistake but they loved me and supported me anyway so you want to separate validation of actions from validation of the decision that you made and of person for one and number two remember that not everybody is going to be able to for one reason or another validate you all the time so you need to be able to validate yourself if they do not agree with it or if they are not providing the attention and quality time and validation that you need all right where can you get it from you know so do not put all your eggs in one basket rely on other people know that you have got other friends that are there to support you even if one friend is kind of flaking out right now do we need validation from our higher power and if you are a spiritual person you may you may want to believe that your higher power approves of you so again you need that's a relationship that nobody else is taking part in so you need to be able to have a good communication with that higher power or a feeling in your head heart and gut that says i am doing right by my higher power and i am making my higher power proud of me if that is a validation that you need and we do need validation from ourselves in order to get love respect validation from other people we have to be able to love respect and validate ourselves so you need to look in the mirror and go I am a good person practice that when you start criticizing yourself and a lot of us get caught up with these self-deprecating comments about you know i am stupid i am not good at that i am whatever knock that off you know that's maybe you made a mistake that's okay but you are still a good person and be able to appreciate yourself for who you are then you are not going to need other people to always validate you because if they are not able to do it because they are caught up with their own stuff or they just are mad at you for some reason or whatever that's okay you know that's their right you do not have to have them to tell you that it's okay that you breathe the air you need to be able to validate yourself so what does validation look like we keep talking about this word but what is it you can have your feelings validated and for a lot of us who are feelers if you go to the myers-briggs we need to have when we feel upset or something we need to have you know we need to have your feelings and they are about to come to the right way they have to have your feelings in place if you have to have them in place that is okay that's our feelings validated we need to have somebody say i can see that you are really angry or i can see that you are really scared they may not agree they do not have to feel the same but if they are identifying how we feel and they are going i got you i am sensing that you feel this way that can be enough now do they have to agree with our feelings if we say yes then we are going to set ourselves up for a world to hurt because we cannot control how other people feel we need to accept that we feel how we feel based on our experiences my experiences are very different than my friends experiences so where where something might stress me out you know it may not stress her out and there are some things that stress her out that do not bother me a bit and you know i understand for example she is terrible fight of paper wasps and i love the little buggers they are they are great beneficial insects they are really docile but i can understand her fear of them and so you know i validate the fact that she's afraid of them and and you know i respect that i do not say oh well you know poo just get over it it's not that easy you know i wish she could see how cute they were but that's not how she's wired so i am not saying that she's afraid of them but i am saying that she's afraid of them and i am not saying that she's afraid of them and i am not saying that she's afraid of them and i am not a little bit terrified of them and i am not saying that she's afraid of them and i am not so i recognize that is a part of her and i validate that we want to validate people's thoughts and they are going to have different opinions my son has different opinions about things than i do and you know i have different opinions than than my mother and etc and that's okay we want to validate their thoughts as you know their thoughts are valid your thoughts your opinions your feelings are valid for you they may not be valid for me but they are valid for you you are not forcing them to be what they are supposed to be but at some point that's okay you are not forcing and i respect you as a person and we need to have our being validated we need to be validated that we are lovable good people and that is independent of what we do and our feelings and our thoughts it's who we are we are good people that make mistakes that are fallible that yes yada yada yada but we need to believe that we are lovable and we need to feel experience that other people believe that we are lovable and again it does not necessarily come from the people that every person that we want it to not everybody is going to validate your being and that's a lot a lot of times that has more to do with their stuff than than your stuff but if you let it destroy your self-esteem and your confidence and your mood and your energy then you are giving them power validate yourself say you know what i am good enough i am smart enough and gosh darn it people like me and and move on and recognize all the other people in your life that validate who you are that person is just missing the boat and then tough diddlywinks for them and that's what we are doing and that's what we are doing and that's what we are doing so what are some reasons we may not get validation from other people well they may not agree or feel the same and they may be unwilling or unable to take our point of view some people have huge control issues it's either their way or the highway now remember i keep saying if they cannot validate you it's probably more about them than about you well this is a perfect example if they are unwilling to respect your point of view or your feelings that's more about them if they are too immersed in their own stuff to be able to begin to understand your point of view whether it's you know whatever drama they have got going on in their life and they just do not have the emotional energy to pay attention to what's going on to you or to listen or to be there for you it does not mean it's about you it means it's their stuff is getting in the way so always take a step back and ask yourself is there some other reason besides me besides me being unvalidatable that this person may be acting this way and 99 of the time you are going to come up with a great big yes now why might we not get validation from ourselves well it's really hard to validate ourselves if we base our entire worth on what other people say do and think about us so if i feel like i am a worthwhile person long as so and so likes me and as long as i am in a relationship and as long as this and that and the other all of those things are involve other people and i cannot control other people so if those other people are caught in their own stuff which a lot of us are these days then i may be out there kind of like flapping like a fish out of water if i can validate myself then i can catch my breath we cannot validate ourselves if we do not appreciate ourselves and you know that whole self-love thing people kind of laugh at it and they are like oh that's so hokey but really you need to realize and call it whatever you want self-respect self-love self-honesty you need to look inside and go i am a good person because and one of the ways that i have clients do this sometimes is go online and find a list of values and if you put in like the top 100 values or something you can get all kinds of values lists and it will say things like honesty and integrity and compassion and yada yada and go through that list and highlight all of the values that represent you and then go back over that list and highlight the top five that really characterize who you are that you are not different and really define who you are and how you feel about yourself and how that is real.",

those things that way you can recognize them in yourself and go what and and say to yourself you know what i am pretty awesome i would like to be my friend because that's what validation is it's being your own best friend and you may not validate yourself if you were taught that we are that you are only lovable if somebody else says you are and again that goes back to relying on other people to get their head out of their own stuff and focus on us that's pretty self-centered is not it so we have got to realize they have got other stuff going on they have got their life and they may not agree with us whatever they have got their stuff and we have got our stuff we all have stuff but we need to be able to look at ourselves independent of our stuff and say i am lovable i am a good person so i encourage you to start working on that today identify five characteristics five values whatever you want to call them that make you a really awesome friend person whatever and focus on those for the next week to realize that you are a good person and that you are a good person and that you are a good therapist for all those things seeing how能cro as us high focus in a moment all right working on your self chaining into the bodyrasp://issue modindi mindset pain calling out so responsible for how to develop their self- kokkei in their day to you know what i am good things may not go the way i plan but i am good so when we come down to relationships information easy tips for how to leverage sharing sticks timings할 forums community tools the videos content search and fewer results easy direction but better guess what works for you how to grab your model team first focus on how to get your social relationships and and validation and everything we need to recognize that letting go and forgiveness can be very scary and if we rely on that other person to validate us then letting go can be terrifying because if I let go of that person who validates me then who's going to do it maybe I will have a place to be so we want to be able to recognize that it's important to be able to validate ourselves so that if somebody leaves our life we do not feel like we are going to disappear forgiveness can be scary because it means letting go of anger it means letting go of hostility it does not mean forgetting and forgiveness is really a power play letting go means choosing not to waste your energy fighting against something you cannot control or is not worth your energy so again going back to a bad relationship for example if you are in a bad relationship and that person is not validating you that person is not making you feel like your uber self they are dragging you down in some way shape or form and it's just it's oil and water it may not be the best relationship to stay in but letting go is hard number one because you know what to expect with that person and you do not know when you are going to find somebody else and dating is a hassle and all that but letting go is a choice you make in order to be true to yourself inside your own your own head your brain and your heart are telling you this is a bad thing this is not where you need to be this is not a good situation for you when you say it yourself and you say you are right this is not a good situation for me I need to get out oh my gosh how liberating is that but then that means you have got to let go that means you have got to let that person go to the curb and be okay with that and choose not to waste your energy fighting against you know trying to change them not waste your energy trying to make them into something they are not we cannot change other people we can help them see things we can suggest that we would like to see some changes but unless they want to make those changes they ai not going to make them we cannot change other people so when we let go we are saying you know what I am done I tried as hard as I can and it's time for me to move on because if I validate my my own thoughts and my own feelings I know that the right move for me is to move on forgiveness means letting go of the hurt and resentment that's draining your energy so you can move forward to what's important to you forgiveness is for you not them so if you are in a relationship that's not meeting your needs and you know you are frustrated with that person because you feel like they are just they are not trying you feel like they are undermining you you feel like they are not validating you whatever it is you know you can get really frustrated at you are not doing this you are not done you are done iPad open the door there's no time to like dropped are up let go okay go ahead let's get together okay30 are resist all right you are not done you are done the doing this okay they are not what are you doing what do you need to do forgiveness is accepting that they either made a mistake or they did something that was unacceptable and you know you identified it or they are not willing to change and you need to be willing to forgive them because that unleashes that energy if you stay angry at them for not changing then when you get into your next relationship you are still carrying that baggage with you and you are probably still back in the back of your mind looking for this next person to do the same thing and the next person after that so forgive that person so you know what you had you were too stuck in your own stuff I am not going to forget I am not going to go back there but I am going to forgive you because it's not worth it I am not going to go back there but I am going to forgive you because it's not worth it worth me staying angry over what you did or did not do for me and I am going to move forward so letting go and forgiveness are things that we generally can only do when we start validating ourselves so can you get validation and have control at the same time well not everybody's going to validate you it's it's not their job to make you feel okay your job is to make you feel okay but there's generally you generally will always have some people that you will that will validate you you know whether it's your parents or your best friend or whomever you are generally going to have someone that will validate you if you get hung up on why a particular person will not validate you ask yourself why do I care you know if this particular person is just not getting with your program why are you why are you beating your head against a wall for that why do you keep going after something that is not clearly not going to resolve the way you want a lot of times this is because you are trying to relive something from the past and you are trying to quote get it right this time so if you have been in a bad relationship and you get into another relationship that's similar you may be trying to make this one work out correctly a lot of times people will redo things subconsciously trying to succeed trying to fix it this time another question you can ask yourself is why am I trying to control this person why is it worth my energy to try to convince them to do all the things that I want the way I want why why do I need to do that there are millions of other people out there what is it about this person and what parts of this situation do I have control over because maybe the person's not doing what you wanted them to do because you have not clearly communicated all right well that you have control over maybe the person is not doing what you want them to do because they do not want to well you do not have control over that so then you can the part you have control over is whether you choose to stay in that relationship and stay in that situation if it is not growth producing if it is hurting you instead of enhancing you when you are in relationships when things happen and you are feeling like you need validation and people are not doing what you want it can be a really icky place to be so practice psychological flexibility identify to yourself that you are feeling empty you are feeling unloved you are feeling however you are feeling and then ask yourself what things can I do starting right know to improve the next moment what would make me happy you know what things can I do what do I have control over can you get enough sleep can you go out and exercise can you hang out with some different friends you know what is it that you can do to improve your next moment instead of staying stuck spinning your wheels it's like a car stuck in the mud and you are just spinning your wheels and throwing mud and digging deeper into it if you try to fight this other situation try to fight and get somebody to do something that they are just not going to do and develop hardiness commitment control and challenge and we are going to focus mainly on commitment remember every single morning when you wake up and every night before you go to bed kind of do an inventory of all the awesome things in your life what's going for you what good things do you have in your life yes you know you are going to have some things that are not going the best you know nobody has a perfect life all the time that's okay but too often we get stuck focusing on those things that are not going the best and then we start feeling unlovable and unsuccessful and un everything so it's important to remember all of it's important to remember all of it's important to remember all of it's important to remember all of the things that you have got going for you the friends that you have the things that are going right in your life and that will help you keep moving forward and remember you know commitment be committed to those values that make you such a lovable awesome person because if you are exuding awesomeness other people are going to gravitate towards you if you are kind and compassionate and caring and intelligent and you know whatever the things are that make you who you are other people who value those qualities are going to gravitate towards you so it's just a matter of taking a breath and living authentically other things that you can do with psychological flexibility you can unhook from your thoughts so you know ending relationships and not going back can be really challenging especially if you have low self-esteem or codependency you know there are a lot of reasons so one of the things to do when you get out of a relationship and you know you are tempted to try to go back and make up you are tempted to minimize what was going on and get back into the relationship a lot of times your brain is saying i cannot live without that person and you may feel in your heart like a part of it's being ripped out and it kind of is and you feel like you cannot take it well unhooking from your thoughts is a way of separating from that and instead of saying i cannot take it say i am having the thought that i cannot take it i am having the thought that i am going to be alone forever and then work through it because thoughts come and go you know let that thought go or replace it with another more accurate thought identify who and what is truly important in your life and acknowledge your feelings thoughts urges and behaviors in the present so if you are feeling lonely and isolated and defeated that's okay acknowledge it instead of fighting with it or ignoring it acknowledge it and then say what can i do to improve the next moment you can make two lists the first list is things that i do or think that help me move toward the important things in my life and review this list every day because these are things that you want to do to keep moving forward and the other list is things that i do or think that keep me stuck drain my forward energy or move me away from what is important and you know dwelling on things chasing after old loves you know there's a lot of things we do that waste our energy that could be used to move towards our goals so you have those two lists review the positive list every day that will help you remember what you need to do to keep moving toward the important things like take care of your health you know if you want to be there for your kids because they are important well one of those ways to do that is to take care of your health so your live a long life and finally make a choice remember that when you feel a certain way you have control over how to use your energy so you can either you know spend the energy running after that person pleading with them to change and to take you back and to do all these things and probably not get anywhere and be back in the same place in a month or you can choose to do something different and live more authentically moving towards other people and things that are important in your life and acknowledge that that one while it had its benefits also had a lot of drawbacks and for your own health sanity and happiness you need to let it go so steps towards self-validation here are some exercises you can do identify the values and characteristics about yourself that make you awesome we talked about that one make a bill of rights and each item starts with item start with item pick and that's your what's your name what's your name you cannot pick and deserve to i deserve to be happy i deserve to take a break i deserve to whatever keep that bill of rights going try to make 20 items that's going to make you really think by the time you get past 10 you really start having to think about you know what exactly do i deserve and if you cannot think of all of them you know think about your kids for example and think about you know what do they deserve what do your kids deserve they deserve to be happy they deserve to be healthy they deserve to not be scared you know what else follow your bill of rights once you write it you got to follow it so remind yourself when you start doing things am i adhering to my own bill of rights identify the people in your past from whom whom you craved validation and never got it and explore why that may have been more about them than about you so if you wanted validation from one of your parents and you just could never seem to please that parent okay you know now that you are older and wiser and everything else let's look back and see if that was more about them and their frustrations or or their stuff than it was about you or maybe they actually did approve of you but they did not know how to communicate it so you did not feel valid even though they approved of you identify why you crave validation do you want to know that you are important and a lot of times if you are not able to self-validate then you need others to tell you you are okay and you are important if you can validate yourself then you do not crave validation from others make a list of people you know who fit the label that like the person that you want to be who is it that is important relevant and lovable in your life and identify how you are like those people so if you have a hard time identifying what's awesome about you look around at your friends and the people that you value and identify what's awesome about them and then go you know do i have that quality and a lot of times you are going to find that yes you do have that quality or something similar so we have gone over you know kind of a broad spectrum and we are talking a lot about validation because the need for validation from other people is one of the reasons that many people stay in unhealthy relationships so we talked about why we may need validation how we can get validation how we can validate ourselves and then we talked a little bit about letting go of control and admitting that sometimes you know somebody else just cannot or will not validate us but a lot of times that's because of their stuff and we cannot fix that they have to be willing to fix that so we have got to be able to let go of control forgive them for not being willing to play by our playbook and move on and then we ended with exploring some psychological flexibility activities that we can do and we have been able to do that for a long time and i think that's a great way to start i think in order to learn about and and keep present in our mind how awesome we are and why we deserve love and respect if you like this podcast please subscribe on your favorite podcast app join our

Um, and somebody wants to connect with us that's validation, but that is kind of, Yeah.\n\nforeign territory for so many people yeah that's really validation yeah I mean that's what I'm really learning right here right now is just understanding the word validation and what it really means that it's not because you you know I've always thought it's just words well not just words but that's how I took it because I actually had a very dear friend I want to say validate me verbally for the first time in my life outside of therapy and I cannot tell you what that did for me but I love that you're sharing that it's the actions that when someone wants to connect with you that's validation when you're treating yourself well that's validation and so really starting with and you're so right about the self-awareness I preach about that all the time that you need to have self-awareness for this healing journey because that's what's really gonna help you out and and if you begin to just look at how you're treating yourself look at what's going on in your head and what you're allowing you know and and changing that yeah and if I can add one other piece to this so many kids in complex trauma validating words were actually forms of manipulation they always have a hidden agenda so I'm gonna say nice things about you to manipulate you to get I've got an ulterior motive for what I want you to do for me so that for me is what I've wanted you to do for me and so that's what's really key for me that for me is what I want you to do for me so that for me is what I've wanted many people as soon as they hear validating words they go i wonder what they really want oh yeah and there's a immediate on guard suspicion that words never mean what they really say there's always a hidden meaning and a hidden agenda and i'm immediately on guard and so that's where for most people they eventually need the healing power of words but they first need words are just too scary for them they need people to treat them with respect yeah that's so true yeah i uh in my first marriage there was a lot of words and not a lot of action or the actions didn't line up with the words and i cannot tell you how frustrating that is and it got to the point where i just i really got to the point where i didn't trust anybody what anybody had to say i didn't even trust myself exactly yeah yeah and i've actually had clients say to me if i give them a verbal validation they look at me and go what do you want and i go i don't want anything i'm just yeah you must want something because that's the only reason anybody ever validates me and it's like wow that's so they can't even trust words at all anymore gosh i didn't even i didn't even think about that until you said that and that's so true that was definitely something that i struggled with is is entrusting people are you saying that to me because you really like me because with me i also had a very deep deep belief system that nobody loved me because i was told that and believed it so your words are going to be an act absolutely nothing even i was suspicious of the actions just because of where i was at yeah yeah but i but i did what i did do is stop looking outwards for my validation and start validating myself and it's been you're right it is a process because i'm still learning i'm learning today look at this yeah so like a very simple term like one of the things that we encourage people to do is just make lists of what they like about themselves what they don't and initially always the list of what they don't is very long and what they like is one or two things or even nothing um but then begin to kind of really focus on seeing themselves accurately because there is a bunch of positives that either you're refusing to see um or nobody's ever acknowledged before so you don't acknowledge it to yourself but do that exercise then ask people that you do trust as safe to do that list on you and see what they say and you may not initially want to trust it but but but let yourself kind of venture into the risk of trusting that these people do care there's no ulterior motive um and they're just giving me honest feedback and gradually you can break down some of the defenses that you've built and because for many people they long for validation but they're it's almost like they're waterproof to validation people can pour validation on them it's just like water off a duck's back it doesn't penetrate because they got so many defenses that i'm not worthy of this i'm bad um everybody's uses words to manipulate me so and so it's it's starting to open up that waterproofing just a little wee bit and then it gradually expands from there but you got to start somewhere you do and one of the things that i've been doing recently that um you know and i know so many of us survivors do is we tend to look at the past and look at all of our mistakes and the things that we screwed up on and i am notorious for doing that and i'm still forgiving myself for some of the stuff that you know my behavior was but i'm now looking at the things i did right exactly i I'm shocked.",

    "text": "That's validation.  , and somebody wants to connect with us that's validation, but that is kind of, yes. Foreign territory for so many people yes that's really validation yes I mean that's what I am really learning right here right now is just understanding the word validation and what it really means that it's not because you you know I have always thought it's just words well not just words but that's how I took it because I actually had a very dear friend I want to say validate me verbally for the first time in my life outside of therapy and I cannot tell you what that did for me but I love that you are sharing that it's the actions that when someone wants to connect with you that's validation when you are treating yourself well that's validation and so really starting with and you are so right about the self-awareness I preach about that all the time that you need to have self-awareness for this healing journey because that's what's really going to help you out and and if you begin to just look at how you are treating yourself look at what's going on in your head and what you are allowing you know and and changing that yes and if I can add one other piece to this so many kids in complex trauma validating words were actually forms of manipulation they always have a hidden agenda so I am going to say nice things about you to manipulate you to get I have got an ulterior motive for what I want you to do for me so that for me is what I have wanted you to do for me and so that's what's really key for me that for me is what I want you to do for me so that for me is what I have wanted many people as soon as they hear validating words they go i wonder what they really want oh yes and there's a immediate on guard suspicion that words never mean what they really say there's always a hidden meaning and a hidden agenda and i am immediately on guard and so that's where for most people they eventually need the healing power of words but they first need words are just too scary for them they need people to treat them with respect yes that's so true yes i in my first marriage there was a lot of words and not a lot of action or the actions did not line up with the words and i cannot tell you how frustrating that is and it got to the point where i just i really got to the point where i did not trust anybody what anybody had to say i did not even trust myself exactly yes yes and i have actually had clients say to me if i give them a verbal validation they look at me and go what do you want and i go i do not want anything i am just yes you must want something because that's the only reason anybody ever validates me and it's like wow that's so they cannot even trust words at all anymore gosh i did not even i did not even think about that until you said that and that's so true that was definitely something that i struggled with is is entrusting people are you saying that to me because you really like me because with me i also had a very deep deep belief system that nobody loved me because i was told that and believed it so your words are going to be an act absolutely nothing even i was suspicious of the actions just because of where i was at yes yes but i but i did what i did do is stop looking outwards for my validation and start validating myself and it's been you are right it is a process because i am still learning i am learning today look at this yes so like a very simple term like one of the things that we encourage people to do is just make lists of what they like about themselves what they do not and initially always the list of what they do not is very long and what they like is one or two things or even nothing but then begin to kind of really focus on seeing themselves accurately because there is a bunch of positives that either you are refusing to see or nobody's ever acknowledged before so you do not acknowledge it to yourself but do that exercise then ask people that you do trust as safe to do that list on you and see what they say and you may not initially want to trust it but but but let yourself kind of venture into the risk of trusting that these people do care there's no ulterior motive and they are just giving me honest feedback and gradually you can break down some of the defenses that you have built and because for many people they long for validation but they are it's almost like they are waterproof to validation people can pour validation on them it's just like water off a duck's back it does not penetrate because they got so many defenses that i am not worthy of this i am bad everybody's uses words to manipulate me so and so it's it's starting to open up that waterproofing just a little wee bit and then it gradually expands from there but you got to start somewhere you do and one of the things that i have been doing recently that you know and i know so many of us survivors do is we tend to look at the past and look at all of our mistakes and the things that we screwed up on and i am notorious for doing that and i am still forgiving myself for some of the stuff that you know my behavior was but i am now looking at the things i did right exactly i I am shocked.",

    "text": "And so that will meet all of these six competing priorities, and so what I want you to understand is that the masks that these children wear were adaptations to survive, adaptations to try to get many different needs met, and they seem to work for a little while, now I should point out that for some children they try multiple roles and masks just to see which one seems to work best for them, and sometimes they use one mask with one person and a different mask with a different person, and they are good at slipping back and forth between the two, almost becoming a chameleon, but that is what they do to survive, and that is so key to understand, it seems to work to get the needs met, now we are going to see that in the long run it does not work, but to a child it seems to help, and one of the things that makes it difficult for the child, and again all this is happening at a subconscious level, one of the things that makes it difficult is that sometimes when they wear that mask they get validated as being a good kid, a wonderful kid, maybe once in a while the mask does not work, they get punished or made fun of, but inconsistent rewards is what I am driving at here, and that always gives a child hope, that maybe the next time I put on that mask or adopt that role, I will get accepted, I will fit in, people want to connect with me, I will be respected, now there's another possibility, sometimes a narcissist parent, and a nabler parent will cast the roles for the children, so it's not necessarily the children adapting, but it's the children being put in a role and expected to perform that role, and so the father could see a talented child, and make him that child his hero, that child has a great report card, let's show them off, that child is athletic, let's put them on display, and so this is their trophy of how good he must be as a dad to have this wonderful child who's so capable, it's a reflection on him is what he wants it to be, or he could have a child who's just, his buddy, he likes the same things as him, so dad likes football and other sports, this kid loves sports as well, dad loves fishing and hunting, this kid loves fishing and hunting, so this one becomes dad's buddy, and he's stuck in that role, and then another one might be dad's little princess, the pretty cute, always agreeable child that dad just loves to show off because of their beauty and how pleasant their personality is, so what a child has with that is if I stay in this role and do it well, I will get lots of validation, and so they learn that well, they try to convince themselves that it's them, but often sadly it's not the real them, it's not what they would naturally want to do or be, and so they are getting validated for performing, not for who they are, which often deepens shame, I hope that helps you understand how complex trauma contributes to the need to wear masks, now there's three kind of categories of masks, and so the one would be task-oriented masks, where you are an accomplisher, task-driven, the second one would be people-oriented, all of your masks are about social interaction, being friendly with people, and then there's a third category of masks, and that's the people who have the masks that we would call destructive or negative, or self-harm type masks, so you are angry all the time, you are harsh, you are intimidating, you are a risk-taker, all of those things, that is how you survive in your world, and that's the mask that you adopt, so what I want to do is take you through just a smattering of different types of masks that people adopt, it's no, by no means a comprehensive list, but maybe it will help you just think through what mask you have worn in your life, so there's the perfectionist, and that's the one who does everything perfectly, and so they think it's going to get them respect because they do everything perfectly, but deep inside they are always focusing on what they did not do perfectly, and it feeds their shame even more, and causes more fear and anxiety, then you have the superhero who's always competent, who's always helping out, who's always rescuing people, problem is often underneath, they feel so inadequate, and if they run into situations where they cannot be superhero four, it makes them feel even more inadequate, and then there's the ones that are just the expert, they are very smart, they read widely, they know lots of trivia, lots of information, and so they get their prestige by always having answers for people, and that's their mask, then the soloist, and this is the person who people look at and go, wow they are so self-sufficient, they can do almost anything, they are a jack of all trades, they do not need any help ever, wow I wish I had that strength, I wish I had that ability to just be able to do everything alone, sadly for many of these people they can never ask for help, because that would expose weakness, and so they stay in this isolated place where they have to be totally self-sufficient, but underneath they feel that they are not cutting it, and then the rescuer who's always there to help, and then there's the rescuer who's always there to help people and trouble, people who are hurting, people who are sick, and so they are just the empathetic person that's rushing in to help them do what they need done, and then a bunch of just very quickly the social butterfly, so this person just flits around like a butterfly at social gatherings, talking to everybody, it's all very superficial but it's very light, it's fluffy, it's fun, that's what they are good at, the comedian we have talked about has always got a joke, an interesting twist that makes things funny, a great storyteller, and then there's the cool guy with ice in his veins, nothing seems to bother them, they are just always under control, and then the martyr, the person who's always making sacrifices, and they talk about all the things they have done, and the hardship they have been through to help others, and that's their identity, and then the bad boy who just, he's just going to break rules, that's going to be who he is, he's not going to fit into any social norms or customs, he has to be outside of the norms in order to be himself, he thinks, and then prim and proper, the person who cannot go out in public unless every hair is in place, and they have all the social etiquette down to a science so that everything is done perfectly in social settings, in relationships, and then the stoic, the person who never shows any emotion, the person who's unruffled, the person who can be going through a crisis, and there's still nothing showing on their face, very stoic, then you get that very hard person, their eyes look cold, their eyes almost look dead, dark, and that's that hard shell that you see, and then the coy, flirtatious person who's always drawing attention to their body, their sexuality, and flirting with people, and then like I said, the chameleon, you just fit whatever you need to be in that situation in order to get people to like you, so you could add your own, and I think it might be a good exercise for you to just make a list of the things that you have done as masks to try to get those six competing priorities met in your life, but what are the results of wearing masks.",

    "text": "And so that will meet all of these six competing priorities, and so what I want you to understand is that the masks that these children wear were adaptations to survive, adaptations to try to get many different needs met, and they seem to work for a little while, now I should point out that for some children they try multiple roles and masks just to see which one seems to work best for them, and sometimes they use one mask with one person and a different mask with a different person, and they are good at slipping back and forth between the two, almost becoming a chameleon, but that is what they do to survive, and that is so key to understand, it seems to work to get the needs met, now we are going to see that in the long run it does not work, but to a child it seems to help, and one of the things that makes it difficult for the child, and again all this is happening at a subconscious level, one of the things that makes it difficult is that sometimes when they wear that mask they get validated as being a good kid, a wonderful kid, maybe once in a while the mask does not work, they get punished or made fun of, but inconsistent rewards is what I am driving at here, and that always gives a child hope, that maybe the next time I put on that mask or adopt that role, I will get accepted, I will fit in, people want to connect with me, I will be respected, now there's another possibility, sometimes a narcissist parent, and a nabler parent will cast the roles for the children, so it's not necessarily the children adapting, but it's the children being put in a role and expected to perform that role, and so the father could see a talented child, and make him that child his hero, that child has a great report card, let's show them off, that child is athletic, let's put them on display, and so this is their trophy of how good he must be as a dad to have this wonderful child who's so capable, it's a reflection on him is what he wants it to be, or he could have a child who's just, his buddy, he likes the same things as him, so dad likes football and other sports, this kid loves sports as well, dad loves fishing and hunting, this kid loves fishing and hunting, so this one becomes dad's buddy, and he's stuck in that role, and then another one might be dad's little princess, the pretty cute, always agreeable child that dad just loves to show off because of their beauty and how pleasant their personality is, so what a child has with that is if I stay in this role and do it well, I will get lots of validation, and so they learn that well, they try to convince themselves that it's them, but often sadly it's not the real them, it's not what they would naturally want to do or be, and so they are getting validated for performing, not for who they are, which often deepens shame, I hope that helps you understand how complex trauma contributes to the need to wear masks, now there's three kind of categories of masks, and so the one would be task-oriented masks, where you are an accomplisher, task-driven, the second one would be people-oriented, all of your masks are about social interaction, being friendly with people, and then there's a third category of masks, and that's the people who have the masks that we would call destructive or negative, or self-harm type masks, so you are angry all the time, you are harsh, you are intimidating, you are a risk-taker, all of those things, that is how you survive in your world, and that's the mask that you adopt, so what I want to do is take you through just a smattering of different types of masks that people adopt, it's no, by no means a comprehensive list, but maybe it will help you just think through what mask you have worn in your life, so there's the perfectionist, and that's the one who does everything perfectly, and so they think it's going to get them respect because they do everything perfectly, but deep inside they are always focusing on what they did not do perfectly, and it feeds their shame even more, and causes more fear and anxiety, then you have the superhero who's always competent, who's always helping out, who's always rescuing people, problem is often underneath, they feel so inadequate, and if they run into situations where they cannot be superhero four, it makes them feel even more inadequate, and then there's the ones that are just the expert, they are very smart, they read widely, they know lots of trivia, lots of information, and so they get their prestige by always having answers for people, and that's their mask, then the soloist, and this is the person who people look at and go, wow they are so self-sufficient, they can do almost anything, they are a jack of all trades, they do not need any help ever, wow I wish I had that strength, I wish I had that ability to just be able to do everything alone, sadly for many of these people they can never ask for help, because that would expose weakness, and so they stay in this isolated place where they have to be totally self-sufficient, but underneath they feel that they are not cutting it, and then the rescuer who's always there to help, and then there's the rescuer who's always there to help people and trouble, people who are hurting, people who are sick, and so they are just the empathetic person that's rushing in to help them do what they need done, and then a bunch of just very quickly the social butterfly, so this person just flits around like a butterfly at social gatherings, talking to everybody, it's all very superficial but it's very light, it's fluffy, it's fun, that's what they are good at, the comedian we have talked about has always got a joke, an interesting twist that makes things funny, a great storyteller, and then there's the cool guy with ice in his veins, nothing seems to bother them, they are just always under control, and then the martyr, the person who's always making sacrifices, and they talk about all the things they have done, and the hardship they have been through to help others, and that's their identity, and then the bad boy who just, he's just going to break rules, that's going to be who he is, he's not going to fit into any social norms or customs, he has to be outside of the norms in order to be himself, he thinks, and then prim and proper, the person who cannot go out in public unless every hair is in place, and they have all the social etiquette down to a science so that everything is done perfectly in social settings, in relationships, and then the stoic, the person who never shows any emotion, the person who's unruffled, the person who can be going through a crisis, and there's still nothing showing on their face, very stoic, then you get that very hard person, their eyes look cold, their eyes almost look dead, dark, and that's that hard shell that you see, and then the coy, flirtatious person who's always drawing attention to their body, their sexuality, and flirting with people, and then like I said, the chameleon, you just fit whatever you need to be in that situation in order to get people to like you, so you could add your own, and I think it might be a good exercise for you to just make a list of the things that you have done as masks to try to get those six competing priorities met in your life, but what are the results of wearing masks.",

    "text": "And so that will meet all of these six competing priorities, and so what I want you to understand is that the masks that these children wear were adaptations to survive, adaptations to try to get many different needs met, and they seem to work for a little while, now I should point out that for some children they try multiple roles and masks just to see which one seems to work best for them, and sometimes they use one mask with one person and a different mask with a different person, and they are good at slipping back and forth between the two, almost becoming a chameleon, but that is what they do to survive, and that is so key to understand, it seems to work to get the needs met, now we are going to see that in the long run it does not work, but to a child it seems to help, and one of the things that makes it difficult for the child, and again all this is happening at a subconscious level, one of the things that makes it difficult is that sometimes when they wear that mask they get validated as being a good kid, a wonderful kid, maybe once in a while the mask does not work, they get punished or made fun of, but inconsistent rewards is what I am driving at here, and that always gives a child hope, that maybe the next time I put on that mask or adopt that role, I will get accepted, I will fit in, people want to connect with me, I will be respected, now there's another possibility, sometimes a narcissist parent, and a nabler parent will cast the roles for the children, so it's not necessarily the children adapting, but it's the children being put in a role and expected to perform that role, and so the father could see a talented child, and make him that child his hero, that child has a great report card, let's show them off, that child is athletic, let's put them on display, and so this is their trophy of how good he must be as a dad to have this wonderful child who's so capable, it's a reflection on him is what he wants it to be, or he could have a child who's just, his buddy, he likes the same things as him, so dad likes football and other sports, this kid loves sports as well, dad loves fishing and hunting, this kid loves fishing and hunting, so this one becomes dad's buddy, and he's stuck in that role, and then another one might be dad's little princess, the pretty cute, always agreeable child that dad just loves to show off because of their beauty and how pleasant their personality is, so what a child has with that is if I stay in this role and do it well, I will get lots of validation, and so they learn that well, they try to convince themselves that it's them, but often sadly it's not the real them, it's not what they would naturally want to do or be, and so they are getting validated for performing, not for who they are, which often deepens shame, I hope that helps you understand how complex trauma contributes to the need to wear masks, now there's three kind of categories of masks, and so the one would be task-oriented masks, where you are an accomplisher, task-driven, the second one would be people-oriented, all of your masks are about social interaction, being friendly with people, and then there's a third category of masks, and that's the people who have the masks that we would call destructive or negative, or self-harm type masks, so you are angry all the time, you are harsh, you are intimidating, you are a risk-taker, all of those things, that is how you survive in your world, and that's the mask that you adopt, so what I want to do is take you through just a smattering of different types of masks that people adopt, it's no, by no means a comprehensive list, but maybe it will help you just think through what mask you have worn in your life, so there's the perfectionist, and that's the one who does everything perfectly, and so they think it's going to get them respect because they do everything perfectly, but deep inside they are always focusing on what they did not do perfectly, and it feeds their shame even more, and causes more fear and anxiety, then you have the superhero who's always competent, who's always helping out, who's always rescuing people, problem is often underneath, they feel so inadequate, and if they run into situations where they cannot be superhero four, it makes them feel even more inadequate, and then there's the ones that are just the expert, they are very smart, they read widely, they know lots of trivia, lots of information, and so they get their prestige by always having answers for people, and that's their mask, then the soloist, and this is the person who people look at and go, wow they are so self-sufficient, they can do almost anything, they are a jack of all trades, they do not need any help ever, wow I wish I had that strength, I wish I had that ability to just be able to do everything alone, sadly for many of these people they can never ask for help, because that would expose weakness, and so they stay in this isolated place where they have to be totally self-sufficient, but underneath they feel that they are not cutting it, and then the rescuer who's always there to help, and then there's the rescuer who's always there to help people and trouble, people who are hurting, people who are sick, and so they are just the empathetic person that's rushing in to help them do what they need done, and then a bunch of just very quickly the social butterfly, so this person just flits around like a butterfly at social gatherings, talking to everybody, it's all very superficial but it's very light, it's fluffy, it's fun, that's what they are good at, the comedian we have talked about has always got a joke, an interesting twist that makes things funny, a great storyteller, and then there's the cool guy with ice in his veins, nothing seems to bother them, they are just always under control, and then the martyr, the person who's always making sacrifices, and they talk about all the things they have done, and the hardship they have been through to help others, and that's their identity, and then the bad boy who just, he's just going to break rules, that's going to be who he is, he's not going to fit into any social norms or customs, he has to be outside of the norms in order to be himself, he thinks, and then prim and proper, the person who cannot go out in public unless every hair is in place, and they have all the social etiquette down to a science so that everything is done perfectly in social settings, in relationships, and then the stoic, the person who never shows any emotion, the person who's unruffled, the person who can be going through a crisis, and there's still nothing showing on their face, very stoic, then you get that very hard person, their eyes look cold, their eyes almost look dead, dark, and that's that hard shell that you see, and then the coy, flirtatious person who's always drawing attention to their body, their sexuality, and flirting with people, and then like I said, the chameleon, you just fit whatever you need to be in that situation in order to get people to like you, so you could add your own, and I think it might be a good exercise for you to just make a list of the things that you have done as masks to try to get those six competing priorities met in your life, but what are the results of wearing masks.",

    "text": "And so that will meet all of these six competing priorities, and so what I want you to understand is that the masks that these children wear were adaptations to survive, adaptations to try to get many different needs met, and they seem to work for a little while, now I should point out that for some children they try multiple roles and masks just to see which one seems to work best for them, and sometimes they use one mask with one person and a different mask with a different person, and they are good at slipping back and forth between the two, almost becoming a chameleon, but that is what they do to survive, and that is so key to understand, it seems to work to get the needs met, now we are going to see that in the long run it does not work, but to a child it seems to help, and one of the things that makes it difficult for the child, and again all this is happening at a subconscious level, one of the things that makes it difficult is that sometimes when they wear that mask they get validated as being a good kid, a wonderful kid, maybe once in a while the mask does not work, they get punished or made fun of, but inconsistent rewards is what I am driving at here, and that always gives a child hope, that maybe the next time I put on that mask or adopt that role, I will get accepted, I will fit in, people want to connect with me, I will be respected, now there's another possibility, sometimes a narcissist parent, and a nabler parent will cast the roles for the children, so it's not necessarily the children adapting, but it's the children being put in a role and expected to perform that role, and so the father could see a talented child, and make him that child his hero, that child has a great report card, let's show them off, that child is athletic, let's put them on display, and so this is their trophy of how good he must be as a dad to have this wonderful child who's so capable, it's a reflection on him is what he wants it to be, or he could have a child who's just, his buddy, he likes the same things as him, so dad likes football and other sports, this kid loves sports as well, dad loves fishing and hunting, this kid loves fishing and hunting, so this one becomes dad's buddy, and he's stuck in that role, and then another one might be dad's little princess, the pretty cute, always agreeable child that dad just loves to show off because of their beauty and how pleasant their personality is, so what a child has with that is if I stay in this role and do it well, I will get lots of validation, and so they learn that well, they try to convince themselves that it's them, but often sadly it's not the real them, it's not what they would naturally want to do or be, and so they are getting validated for performing, not for who they are, which often deepens shame, I hope that helps you understand how complex trauma contributes to the need to wear masks, now there's three kind of categories of masks, and so the one would be task-oriented masks, where you are an accomplisher, task-driven, the second one would be people-oriented, all of your masks are about social interaction, being friendly with people, and then there's a third category of masks, and that's the people who have the masks that we would call destructive or negative, or self-harm type masks, so you are angry all the time, you are harsh, you are intimidating, you are a risk-taker, all of those things, that is how you survive in your world, and that's the mask that you adopt, so what I want to do is take you through just a smattering of different types of masks that people adopt, it's no, by no means a comprehensive list, but maybe it will help you just think through what mask you have worn in your life, so there's the perfectionist, and that's the one who does everything perfectly, and so they think it's going to get them respect because they do everything perfectly, but deep inside they are always focusing on what they did not do perfectly, and it feeds their shame even more, and causes more fear and anxiety, then you have the superhero who's always competent, who's always helping out, who's always rescuing people, problem is often underneath, they feel so inadequate, and if they run into situations where they cannot be superhero four, it makes them feel even more inadequate, and then there's the ones that are just the expert, they are very smart, they read widely, they know lots of trivia, lots of information, and so they get their prestige by always having answers for people, and that's their mask, then the soloist, and this is the person who people look at and go, wow they are so self-sufficient, they can do almost anything, they are a jack of all trades, they do not need any help ever, wow I wish I had that strength, I wish I had that ability to just be able to do everything alone, sadly for many of these people they can never ask for help, because that would expose weakness, and so they stay in this isolated place where they have to be totally self-sufficient, but underneath they feel that they are not cutting it, and then the rescuer who's always there to help, and then there's the rescuer who's always there to help people and trouble, people who are hurting, people who are sick, and so they are just the empathetic person that's rushing in to help them do what they need done, and then a bunch of just very quickly the social butterfly, so this person just flits around like a butterfly at social gatherings, talking to everybody, it's all very superficial but it's very light, it's fluffy, it's fun, that's what they are good at, the comedian we have talked about has always got a joke, an interesting twist that makes things funny, a great storyteller, and then there's the cool guy with ice in his veins, nothing seems to bother them, they are just always under control, and then the martyr, the person who's always making sacrifices, and they talk about all the things they have done, and the hardship they have been through to help others, and that's their identity, and then the bad boy who just, he's just going to break rules, that's going to be who he is, he's not going to fit into any social norms or customs, he has to be outside of the norms in order to be himself, he thinks, and then prim and proper, the person who cannot go out in public unless every hair is in place, and they have all the social etiquette down to a science so that everything is done perfectly in social settings, in relationships, and then the stoic, the person who never shows any emotion, the person who's unruffled, the person who can be going through a crisis, and there's still nothing showing on their face, very stoic, then you get that very hard person, their eyes look cold, their eyes almost look dead, dark, and that's that hard shell that you see, and then the coy, flirtatious person who's always drawing attention to their body, their sexuality, and flirting with people, and then like I said, the chameleon, you just fit whatever you need to be in that situation in order to get people to like you, so you could add your own, and I think it might be a good exercise for you to just make a list of the things that you have done as masks to try to get those six competing priorities met in your life, but what are the results of wearing masks.",
